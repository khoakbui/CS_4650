"you know , one of the great art <unk> and a pleasure with the <unk> research is <unk> with the people who remember their old days , <unk> the past , and the time they <unk> the wind in <unk> in the sun , they &apos;re still in the rain ."
"and simply that <unk> <unk> beyond the milky way to travel , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> are still very much , or the himalayas <unk> the buddhist <unk> still <unk> , so the treasure is the <unk> to determine that the main <unk> in the <unk> of the central reality ."
"and of course , we all share the same <unk> ."
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re going to put children to the globe .
we go through <unk> .
we have to be able to <unk> <unk> over the death of death and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing and <unk> and art .
"but what &apos;s interesting is that the unique transformation of the <unk> , the rhythm of the <unk> <unk> in every culture ."
"in fact it does not matter if the <unk> are on the edge of the <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> into haiti , or the front of the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in <unk> , or a <unk> in the sahara of the middle ."
"all these people teach us that there are other <unk> , other <unk> , others on earth <unk> to <unk> ."
"so it &apos;s a idea , which is to think about , you know , only can meet hope ."
"together , the <unk> cultures of the world <unk> and <unk> live , the earth that is important to earth , as it is as important for the earth as the biological <unk> that we know as as the biosphere ."
"you can imagine this cultural <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , and you can imagine , as the <unk> <unk> of all ideas and dreams , <unk> ideas , <unk> and <unk> , who have been defined by human imagination as the beginnings of conscious consciousness ."
the <unk> is a great <unk> of humanity .
"it &apos;s the symbol of what we do , and what the species are capable of possible species ."
"and the biosphere as much as the biosphere was <unk> , this was happened in the process of the <unk> -- just with the bigger pace ."
"it would be <unk> for the example that 50 percent , 50 percent of the species are just <unk> from that <unk> , and yet , it &apos;s not quite true . and yet , that <unk> is <unk> diversity in the area of <unk> -- hardly the area that it <unk> , not much <unk> -- which is"
and the <unk> of the <unk> is the extinction of languages .
"so as everyone was born in this room , we were talking about <unk> languages ."
"now it &apos;s a language not just the <unk> of the <unk> , or a series of <unk> ."
one of them is the language for human <unk> .
she &apos;s a way of <unk> the body with the soul of a particular culture of access to the <unk> world .
"every language is like a <unk> in the <unk> forest , <unk> , an <unk> , an ecosystem <unk> to be able to do that ."
"and of these <unk> languages now , as we sat in monterey , just that half <unk> don &apos;t <unk> into children &apos;s ears ."
they &apos;re not taught anymore . that means not anything we &apos;re already born .
"what could be lonely than to be on the silence , one of the <unk> about his father &apos;s <unk> to have the language that you have no opportunity to have , to be the wisdom of the ancestors of the children , or <unk> children ?"
"and yet <unk> , this terrible <unk> actually saved a <unk> of the earth , about two weeks , because every two weeks , a person dies and is <unk> the last <unk> of an old language with him ."
"and i know some of them are saying , &quot; well , not better ? is it &apos;s not a better place , if all we &apos;re just talking about language ? &quot; i said &quot; yes , do they go up . do that <unk> . be that language <unk> ."
let them be iranian . &quot;
then they suddenly realized what if they could talk their own language .
"so , i &apos;m going to <unk> them today through <unk> <unk> , taking a little trip through <unk> to try to do some of what &apos;s actually lost ."
now there are some of us who have <unk> <unk> in the world that i believe if i &apos;m telling <unk> of the different possibilities of his own .
"so if you take this kid to the amazon , <unk> , the amazon of the <unk> , the people who think they &apos;ve taken off the world &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> from the sacred <unk> ."
"this is a people that are not cognitively cognitively being solved between the color blue and green , because the <unk> <unk> is the forest of the people are <unk> on ."
"and they have a <unk> language , and a <unk> called the <unk> <unk> language , so you must marry someone else speaks to one other language ."
"all these <unk> in the western past , the <unk> of that large houses where , among the age of two or seven languages , they &apos;re spoken to be seven , but you never hear someone &apos;s hearing one language ."
they just hear it and they start talking .
"or , one of the fascinating <unk> that i &apos;ve ever ever met with was the most amazing <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the worst people <unk> by <unk> , which was <unk> by the year <unk> ."
"in the year <unk> , five <unk> were trying to record and they made a mistake of failure ."
they <unk> <unk> images from the air from what we would be <unk> as a friendly <unk> ; they were <unk> to be seen these people from the rainforest in their lives never had something to see something <unk> .
"so , they <unk> those photographs of <unk> , trying to see the face , or see the character , and they found nothing and that they were going to be , and kill the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> were going to the <unk>"
"but the <unk> were killing , they did not only kill <unk> ."
and they <unk> each other .
there &apos;s <unk> percent of population deaths from <unk> .
"we <unk> the <unk> eight generations and found two cases of a natural <unk> , and when we were <unk> with a little bit of a , they gave it one of the people to get that he died because he died of his age and he died ."
"but at that same time , they had a clear amount of <unk> that was remarkable ."
their <unk> of a <unk> of the animal that had <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> distance and determine what <unk> <unk> of that <unk> was .
"in the early years , i was actually going to have an amazing task , where my professor in harvard professor , i was interested in whether i was going to go to haiti and <unk> the secret of the foundation that took on <unk> and the military development of <unk> ."
"and to give that <unk> a sense , of all of course , i had to think about this remarkable belief in the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> is no <unk> of black magic ."
"on the opposite , it &apos;s a complex <unk> ."
it &apos;s interesting .
"if i &apos;d ask you , the big <unk> , what do you would say ?"
"<unk> -- islam , <unk> , <unk> , and whatever ."
"a continent becomes <unk> , because the <unk> thought there was no religious belief in sub-saharan africa . of course there was a <unk> and it just thought of that very sad religious thoughts in the <unk> in the &apos; 60s ."
"but what <unk> does so is , this life has that living relationship between the living and dead ."
the living <unk> of the minds .
"the <unk> can be <unk> by the great water , <unk> up to the rhythm to the <unk> of the soul for living , so that the <unk> of a brief moment will be going to go to a <unk> moment ."
"<unk> are like to say the <unk> , &quot; your white goes to church and say about god ."
we dance the temple and we become god . &quot;
"and because you &apos;re obsessed , going to be taken off the mind , and how can you make harm ?"
"and you see this incredible <unk> : <unk> in a <unk> , which <unk> fire without <unk> , <unk> a surprising of its ability to <unk> its own <unk> as that it becomes as if the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , in an active state <unk> ."
"now , with all the people i &apos;ve met , the harvard &apos;s <unk> at sierra de <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> ."
"the <unk> civilization , the <unk> civilization that opened this <unk> from colombia to <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> movement , was turning back to this <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> that is <unk> down ."
"and the very <unk> continent , were these people who never had been <unk> by the <unk> ."
"until about today today , you &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> training program . in <unk> , the training education is extremely remarkable ."
"the mother <unk> are separated from <unk> , from four years from their families and in one world of the <unk> &apos;s <unk> , in <unk> of 18 years <unk> for 18 years , two , <unk> , to <unk> her , to the ninth <unk> , by nine months ."
"and over those time , they get <unk> into the values of their society , the value that their <unk> <unk> have <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> and only their <unk> -- or , we may tell them the <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> &apos;s ."
"in the end of this amazing , they &apos;ll suddenly go out and back to their life , at the age of 18 and at age at the old age of 18 , and she shares a look at what the <unk> of the beauty began to come up when she &apos;s most <unk> on this beautiful when the"
"it &apos;s so wonderful , you &apos;re all to protect it . &quot;"
they call older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers that are responsible for the destruction of the world .
well this layer of space is extremely important .
"and every time we think about <unk> and landscape , we &apos;re actually <unk> into the <unk> and it &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> a <unk> thought , or <unk> , or <unk> , and that these folks are connected to how to nature ."
"so <unk> <unk> aren &apos;t <unk> , they &apos;re never going to be <unk> from <unk> ."
"it doesn &apos;t matter much to the <unk> of <unk> and the cold wind from <unk> <unk> , but they still have <unk> through and an <unk> <unk> of the earth <unk> , which can &apos;t be aware of their own <unk> , but the fact in <unk> ."
"well , what does that mean ?"
"it means that a little baby boy that in <unk> grew , that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> to determine who &apos;s being a <unk> , and will be a very different <unk> , and a <unk> , a way of the country or an actor in that country ."
whether he &apos;s a <unk> or a bunch of <unk> is <unk> .
"the interesting thing is the metaphor , which <unk> relationship between individual and nature as it is defined ."
i grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and believed these forests are because there were to be more <unk> .
"this was what made me <unk> for another human beings , in the <unk> of the <unk> who think these forests are the forest of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> who <unk> the world , who would be <unk> to <unk> their lives ."
"now , if you &apos;re starting to look at the idea that these cultures <unk> can create different <unk> , you can understand some of their extraordinary things about it -- like this plant ."
it &apos;s a photo that i took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
"this is <unk> <unk> , from which many of you have heard , the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> ."
"and what <unk> doing is that not just <unk> potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s actually made by two different sources of light . on the page , there &apos;s been this <unk> , which is a series of <unk> , a number of <unk> that little <unk> she can easily , a number of <unk> <unk>"
"and this plant contains quite a strong plant , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> very similar ."
"if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> <unk> , how you <unk> this stuff , that substance them <unk> it from various different ways ."
"and to <unk> this <unk> is about as <unk> as being created by a <unk> , <unk> from <unk> <unk> and the sea <unk> on an ocean <unk> ."
"it &apos;s not made <unk> <unk> of reality , but resolution of reality ."
"i even did the professor , richard <unk> , the guy who took the <unk> <unk> with the magic <unk> in mexico in mexico , i told you that i couldn &apos;t get this <unk> as the <unk> ."
"but the thing about <unk> is they can &apos;t be <unk> , because of the human <unk> , of course , by <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> with <unk> <unk> , <unk> ."
you can only be <unk> with a different chemicals that <unk> the mao .
"now the fascinating thing is that the <unk> that are in the dna , <unk> of the kinds of things that are needed to <unk> the world . ask . so , you &apos;re in a <unk> ."
"how can these people out from a <unk> of <unk> of <unk> <unk> plants that are able to find two <unk> plants that , in the way , are creating one sort of a <unk> version , so that the whole greater than the sum of his parts is ?"
"we &apos;re using this great <unk> , trial and mistakes <unk> , which <unk> ."
"but you ask the indian people say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;"
so what does that mean ?
"that one tribe that goes back up to 17 <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> that you see all of the distance in the forest that seems like a kind of kind of view ."
"and then you ask the way you <unk> their <unk> , and you say , &quot; i thought you &apos;re learning something about plants ."
"i love you know anything at all ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot; &quot;"
"so it turns out that you &apos;re all the <unk> of the 17 <unk> , and you <unk> them into a different <unk> ."
"now , it doesn &apos;t take a <unk> to harvard in harvard , but it &apos;s much interesting to count ."
"now , the <unk> problem is that even among us , the ones that have the <unk> for the hard <unk> have had , look as <unk> and <unk> , they somehow look at the past , the world , our current , our world is the world ."
"so in fact , you &apos;re going to remember the 20th century 300 or not going to look for innovation , but in fact than a era , a era of <unk> , we &apos;ve been developing and the massive extremism in <unk> of cultural and <unk> ."
all cultures have been involved with the dance that we &apos;ve got to get over again .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> <unk> didn &apos;t hear less on the sioux than the <unk> and arrow interest as the american americans were to be american than their &quot; and the <unk> . &quot;
"not change and technology that &apos;s <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , it &apos;s done . <unk> <unk> &apos;s face ."
"and you &apos;re always <unk> into the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not going to be <unk> , these are developed creatures that are <unk> <unk> of forces that disease <unk> with its capacity , and to use it to <unk> ."
"or if you go to the mountains of <unk> , where i go to a lot of <unk> , you &apos;re going to see the very <unk> of political <unk> face ."
"you know , the death of <unk> , is caused by people to be in general , but the <unk> , the destruction of the lifestyle , not only is not <unk> , but in <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
and they cannot understand <unk> the suffering when they haven &apos;t <unk> that much .
"i had gone to a boy <unk> of <unk> <unk> miles in <unk> <unk> from <unk> to <unk> , and only after me , after <unk> <unk> , i saw the <unk> of the statistics that was going off , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in <unk> , so <unk> <unk> ."
the dad of that young <unk> as his <unk> was driven the <unk> .
that meant that he had ever <unk> out in the chinese <unk> .
"and his uncle can make up your <unk> in the diaspora , which brought people into nepal ."
his mother was in <unk> as <unk> to be the crime .
"he was <unk> in prison at the age of two that i went to prison in jail for them in their lifetime , because they could not live with them ."
the sister that made that <unk> was put in an <unk> <unk> .
she <unk> them off and she had to put a <unk> in <unk> and for that <unk> she had to <unk> she <unk> for seven years .
"the suffering can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> mind of the people is something more <unk> ."
"and at the end of the way , we &apos;re actually doing a choice -- we want to live in a <unk> world , or in a <unk> world in a <unk> world of living over there ?"
"<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before she died that it was the greatest <unk> we move into a path , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , not only the whole human imagination , was to see that <unk> , and the other <unk> <unk> , was going to be able to see that we could see"
"and it is <unk> to think that maybe we &apos;ve got over 600,000 years since have ."
"the <unk> revolution that took us the farming and <unk> us on this moment to <unk> the <unk> , the poetry of <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and also a half of them in <unk> , just a 10,000 years ago ."
the modern industrial world as we can know is hardly 300 .
"well , those <unk> <unk> history says that we don &apos;t have any answers to the challenges we &apos;re standing towards the <unk> of the results ."
"if we asked these <unk> <unk> to the importance of what &apos;s <unk> ask , they answer 10,000 voices in different states ."
"and on this song , we become the chance of what we are : people who know the <unk> to be aware of what all the importance of humans and gardens can be <unk> . and there is a great <unk> ."
"here is an photograph i took to the <unk> end of my <unk> as i was walking around the <unk> , and this man , she <unk> , telling me a wonderful story of his favorite ."
"the <unk> government is not always very well <unk> with <unk> and over and <unk> years , with the <unk> years of being <unk> to <unk> ."
the grandfather &apos;s <unk> out of this man .
"the nurse who was scared about his life had , took it all the guns and all of the tools ."
"now you need to know that <unk> <unk> don &apos;t make fear of cold , and they <unk> it to your advantage ."
their <unk> were originally taken by a fish that had been <unk> in <unk> in <unk> .
"the <unk> man , man &apos;s husband is not <unk> of the <unk> night or <unk> storm <unk> ."
"he <unk> down from out , and took a little <unk> down , and he <unk> down into his hand , and when the milk started to <unk> , it was <unk> in a form of <unk> ."
"and he was <unk> <unk> on the sides of the <unk> , and as it was completely entirely entirely , he <unk> a dog ."
"he took the dog and he had the <unk> , and he put the skeleton of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a dog and he <unk> a <unk> to the other dog , and the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> ."
it can make you something from that .
"and that is a symbol of <unk> resistance , the resistance of the same <unk> and all over the world ."
the government <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the 2000 had the <unk> control of the field back of the area in april of the <unk> and <unk> .
it &apos;s our new country &apos;s home and called the <unk> .
"it &apos;s an independent area . all <unk> , you control ."
"and an amazing example , as a nation , a state that <unk> with his <unk> can look and achieve their own <unk> ."
"and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , to be , at least for the ones we &apos;re traveling to that far away from the earth to realize that it &apos;s not even gone ."
they &apos;re the most amazing thing of somebody else .
"they represent parts of the human imagination , in <unk> times , and for us , to get the dream of the kids , like the dreams of our own children &apos;s own portion of the cosmos ."
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is we think that politicians don &apos;t have to get a bit .
"we believe that the <unk> -- we believe that , that <unk> is not <unk> , but we believe <unk> the world can change the world and we &apos;re probably the best institution to <unk> in the world . our website is <unk> billion dollars every month ."
<unk> countries send our <unk> .
and our papers are being heard of millions .
"and we do a set of travel <unk> that we have to take our audience into places like such cultural <unk> from the <unk> , and will be inspired by the other world , and i &apos;ll allow them to create the <unk> of <unk> , that we have <unk> , and that the most <unk> world of <unk>"
thank you .
"and what i &apos;m first , as quickly as i &apos;m going to show , is the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;ve got to have in a <unk> right now , <unk> that it &apos;s a <unk> environment and it &apos;s within a field ."
"so , we see many , many <unk> of the digital photos here , which is the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , you could make <unk> in some <unk> way ."
"and it &apos;s not matter how many of it are about how huge information is , how big it &apos;s <unk> , or how big you are ."
"most of you are the <unk> of a camera , but this is the example of an <unk> of building and it &apos;s in a area of 300 <unk> ."
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that the performance of a system that will be the number of times on the amount of <unk> on every moment is still slightly productive architecture .
"this is a whole book , an example of <unk> ."
this is <unk> <unk> home . each <unk> is one chapter .
"to prove that it really makes a bit about text and not a picture , we can do something like that is really , to really <unk> that these are a real <unk> of <unk> , and no picture ."
"perhaps , this is an artificial way to read a <unk> ."
i wouldn &apos;t make it <unk> .
this is a <unk> case . this is one copy of the guardian .
and each big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
"and that gives you the delight and the good experience of a magazine , a paper magazine or a paper , which is sort of a form of a bunch of <unk> ."
we did something on the corner of this special issue of the guardian .
we created a false piece with <unk> that &apos;s so much lower than at the normal display and we &apos;ve got some <unk> information .
"if you like that the same functions of these cars , they &apos;ll see you here ."
"or others , even <unk> , <unk> ."
and this is really <unk> these kinds of ideas to do these <unk> in the screen .
and we hope that that &apos;s not <unk> and other nonsense that means it &apos;s not needed to be necessary .
"of course , that &apos;s <unk> one of the really obvious applications for a technology that &apos;s like this ."
"and i &apos;m really going to spend not going to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we will also contribute to this part ."
but this is all roads in the <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> on nasa &apos;s <unk> .
let &apos;s do something else about that .
this is actually live on the internet . they can <unk> it .
this is a project that &apos;s <unk> called data <unk> that actually connects two different technologies to each other .
"it &apos;s one <unk> and the others are very good studies of <unk> <unk> , <unk> by noah of washington at university , under the <unk> of martin , steve <unk> on the <unk> ."
"and rick <unk> &apos;s <unk> from microsoft &apos;s research was done . really , very good collaboration ."
"and so this is live in internet , and it goes by <unk> ."
"you see this , if we can create this kind of <unk> that we can make through images and make the experience of <unk> <unk> ."
but the <unk> <unk> of the images is in fact of meaning .
"so the <unk> <unk> these images together so they put it the real space that they &apos;ve all been doing in the <unk> area where all of the <unk> <unk> were made in the front of <unk> , and they &apos;re looking at <unk> and <unk> things like these <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> and the <unk>"
and i know not that i have time to show you another environments .
there are what the many <unk> that are .
"i would like to show you one of the most surprising <unk> of noah <unk> , and this is from a <unk> <unk> we first worked in the summer to show what i think this is actually what we really <unk> , and that &apos;s the model of technology that it , and this , and what the <unk>"
we had to get away because of the lawyers and so forth .
"this is an <unk> of cathedral , lady <unk> , who were <unk> to photographs with <unk> of <unk> . give them just <unk> <unk> lady in <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> pictures of men in the <unk> and the <unk> , and all this picture , and this <unk> <unk> is the <unk> ."
"so these are all <unk> , and they all have a <unk> on this kind of connection ."
and we can do that very simple things .
"you know , i haven &apos;t believed that finally i will be working at microsoft ."
i &apos;m very grateful for the <unk> .
i suspect you can see that there are many different kinds of cameras : all about the time that they were professional to <unk> is a pretty large number of <unk> to you all in that surroundings were <unk> .
"and if we can , i &apos;ll find some of the <unk> ."
"many of them are <unk> on their face , etc ."
there &apos;s a series of photography -- there are photographs .
"this actually is a poster of <unk> lady , which was actually recorded ."
we can change that poster from the <unk> to this physical view .
"now the thing here is that we can do things with the social surroundings . now it &apos;s going to collect data from all the time -- from all the <unk> of it looks like , visual soil , and everything will <unk> ."
"all these photographs will be connected to each other , and there &apos;s something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts of it ."
it &apos;s getting an model that &apos;s going to happen all over this .
so consider this to be the sequel of <unk> from stephen <unk> earth .
"and this is something that is using the complexity of people using it , and its use it for using the application , it will continue to be bigger ."
their own photos of <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
"if somebody has been doing the trouble and <unk> all of the <unk> that all they &apos;re all , then my photo will take away from the <unk> of <unk> , and i can use these data , to use them as <unk> into these <unk> in the room , and another in the <unk> , and so they"
"and of course , all <unk> of those are the <unk> rich virtual <unk> of each interesting parts of earth that have not only been <unk> with <unk> and so forth and so have been <unk> , but by creating collective <unk> ."
thank you so .
"does i really understand them ? your software is that in a given time within some time , every images that will be used by someone &apos;s in the world in the world are basically associated with one together ."
yes . they &apos;re not making any other than discovering .
when they want to make them <unk> between the pictures .
and it does that because of the <unk> of <unk> .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the <unk> of the information that many pictures that many of these images .
how you do an <unk> for images where you get in the <unk> and the text of the website is in many of the data about what that image is .
but how if the picture is linked to you with all the photographs ?
"and then the <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> that makes it so much -- there &apos;s a huge <unk> ."
"blaise , that &apos;s really amazing . <unk> <unk> ."
thank you so much .
"and i will tell you some of this stuff from my book of what i hope that i hope in <unk> other things that you &apos;ve heard , and i &apos;m going to try to create myself a few connections that i &apos;ve just <unk> for them ."
i &apos;d like to begin with what i call <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
what &apos;s that the <unk> process of what ?
the most <unk> <unk> of all <unk> and developing communities .
"the most powerful news system works so when our goal of <unk> the <unk> of our citizens is , is all about the way the freedom of the <unk> ."
"the reason this is that freedom is fine is good , <unk> , makes sense of <unk> ."
"when people have freedom , each of us has every one for us to do the things that our <unk> has given us , and nobody has to <unk> us ."
the path for freedom to <unk> is to <unk> .
"the more <unk> people , the more freedom to have it , the more freedom , and the more freedom they have the , the more <unk> they have ."
"that is , i think that &apos;s so deeply in our <unk> <unk> that it would not come in any point in meaning ."
"and it &apos;s also deep in our lives , too ."
and i &apos;m going to show you some of the examples of what we do to make modern progress .
this is my favorite line . not great .
i just want to say a minute about <unk> .
there &apos;s 47 <unk> in my 20s when you don &apos;t <unk> the 10 extra extra <unk> and 12 <unk> that they could buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> event of not the <unk> of the one .
so that &apos;s how <unk> is .
"and then they go into the <unk> store , to <unk> a <unk> -- <unk> , an <unk> , <unk> , radio . and in this electronics there &apos;s a lot of <unk> ."
we can give <unk> million different kinds of plants that are <unk> from the elements of the components that are <unk> into a store .
you need to realize that that &apos;s a big <unk> .
"in other areas , it &apos;s <unk> ."
"there &apos;s a time when i was a big , there &apos;s been a kid to get everybody who wanted to go to this , when he came from the bell bell ."
they &apos;re carrying your phone phone <unk> . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a result of this was that the telephone never had broken .
and these days are over .
"and we have almost an infinite <unk> phone , especially in the world of mobile phones ."
these are the mobile phone phone &apos;s mobile .
"my favorite is that in the middle -- it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"and if you didn &apos;t look at this until now you saw this in your business , you &apos;ll certainly be , you &apos;ll be a little bit ."
"and what that does , it &apos;s <unk> people <unk> them into the business and <unk> that question ."
"so , do you know what the answer to this question is ?"
and the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a <unk> that &apos;s not too much .
"in other aspects of life , which are much more powerful than buying that from <unk> , is the same amount of choices to choice ."
"health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case , in the united states they will go to a doctor , and the doctor says to you ."
"they go to a <unk> , and the doctor said we &apos;d make a , or we would make a b ."
so a is the benefits to all those risks .
b has those benefits and risk . what are you to do ?
"and you &apos;re saying , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;"
"the doctor says , a is <unk> the benefits and danger is the benefits of risk and risk ."
what are you going to do .
"when they say , &quot; if you were you , doctor , what you would do ? &quot;"
"the doctor is saying , &quot; but i &apos;m not ."
"the outcome is -- we have a &quot; patients &apos; autonomy &quot; -- that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , an <unk> responsibility for the decision making some decisions that is not a <unk> <unk> -- a doctor and a doctor &apos;s <unk> -- does not a doctor ."
"there &apos;s an enormous marketing <unk> for people like you and me , if you &apos;re about this , you don &apos;t even make any sense of it , because we don &apos;t buy them ."
"why do they spend in order that , if we can &apos;t buy ?"
"the reply is to us , you &apos;ll expect about to the doctor next morning , to ask a change of the food industry ."
so this is something that <unk> as our identity is now a question of what this slide would have to show .
we have no identity ; we are <unk> them .
and let &apos;s make us so often <unk> like us .
it means every day you decide when you &apos;re in tomorrow you &apos;re trying to decide what one of the type that person wants to be .
"over marriage and family and family , there was a time when the <unk> was , that almost every one had an opportunity , and that you could quickly <unk> how they could and then kids started to get as fast as you could ."
"the only real choice is &quot; who , &quot; not whenever and what they did after it ."
"now , today , it &apos;s all easy to have ."
"i teach wonderful smart <unk> students , and i &apos;ll give them 20 percent of their own work ."
"they &apos;re not <unk> because they &apos;re less expensive , not because they &apos;re just less carefully carefully ."
"it &apos;s because it &apos;s involved in other things , you ask yourself , say , &quot; do i get married or not , should i marry ?"
"should i get married later ? is , can you do a children or i do it first to do it ? &quot;"
they are always questions .
"and they will answer these questions , whether that mean all the tasks to make them , that i don &apos;t have a good grade grade at my class ."
"and in fact , they should do . these are the important questions about ."
"work -- we are blessed , as carl <unk> , using technology , which allow for every minute from every day from space to a room on the planet -- up to the <unk> hotel ."
and there &apos;s one corner from the way i &apos;m not going to tell anybody to work on the <unk> .
i won &apos;t tell you because i want to use it .
"so what it means is to make these incredible freedom of choice with this kind of work to make decisions , and then , again , we should be working or should we should work again or shouldn &apos;t work ."
"we can play our kids as <unk> <unk> , and we have our phones on the hip and our <unk> to our hip , and our laptop might be in our own lap ."
"and if you &apos;re <unk> , every minute in our child , we are <unk> with a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , we should ask ourselves , &quot; should i call this call the &quot; phone <unk> ?"
would i write that email ? should i write those letter ? &apos; &quot;
"and if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; will it certainly have been their experience of your <unk> very different from your child &apos;s age ."
"everywhere we &apos;re going on , big stuff and small things , <unk> and lifestyle things . it &apos;s a question of choice ."
and the world of we lived that way .
"and so i want to say , there was some <unk> , but not all of that was a question ."
and the world in our now looks .
"and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?"
the answer &apos;s &quot; yes . &quot;
"now we all know all of it &apos;s good at all about this , so i &apos;ll make it a bad thing about it ."
"all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on human beings ."
"a impact , more <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> instead of free ."
"so , with many <unk> that you can choose , you can &apos;t get very difficult to get into any decision ."
"and i &apos;ll give you one more successful example of this , a study of investing in volunteer volunteers ."
"an <unk> of me had access to <unk> access from <unk> , <unk> , from about a million <unk> of about millions of <unk> jobs , and about 2,000 different jobs ."
"and what she was <unk> a decade of the company that gave the performance , it took two percent off ."
they give 50 to <unk> -- that &apos;s 10 percent less staff than they were giving to five <unk> . why ?
"because it was 50 lines of <unk> that come to the <unk> , it &apos;s so hard to decide what to choose to do that in tomorrow ."
"and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never coming ."
"you just realize that that &apos;s not necessarily being <unk> with the people when you &apos;re going to eat in your <unk> , because you haven &apos;t to have enough money to do it , and it &apos;s very hard , the choices that you make your diet needs ."
"by not to spend the reason to 5,000 <unk> dollars each year on the <unk> that would be happy for their contribution ."
paralysis is a <unk> of many <unk> .
and i think it <unk> the world looks like that .
"they really want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s all available to everybody , right ?"
"they don &apos;t just choose to choose the wrong <unk> , or do the wrong things ."
"so this is a effect . the other effect is that even when we reach paralysis and make a choice , we end less satisfied with the outcome of how we had a way for learning opportunity to keep the opportunity between us ."
and there are several reasons that we do about this .
"one of them is <unk> from the big <unk> <unk> <unk> , if they buy one , not perfect -- and what <unk> &apos;s ever done ? they just <unk> ? it is a decision that she had better decision . and that would be a choice ."
"so , the more options , the more the it &apos;s not to regret , that &apos;s <unk> for a choice ."
"second , what economists call <unk> <unk> ."
dan <unk> did a big dot in that tomorrow by telling them what kind of the way that we do is to compare things on what we compare it .
"ok , when it gives lots of alternatives to think , it is just possible to imagine alternatives of alternatives that they give them more comfortable with the alternative , which they &apos;ve <unk> them ."
"here &apos;s an example . the one of you that are no new new yorker , i &apos;m <unk> myself ."
but here are what they should think .
here &apos;s some of the <unk> .
very expensive <unk> .
<unk> beach a day . they do it all for yourself .
"what could be better ? &quot; damn the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s <unk> ."
every one in my oldest neighborhood is gone .
i can park on a house in front of the house . &quot;
"and he &apos;s spending two weeks of that thought that he &apos;s <unk> the opportunity a day , day a great parking lot ."
"<unk> <unk> the <unk> that we receive through our <unk> , even if what we have <unk> is fantastic ."
"and the further ways that we have on this <unk> , and that &apos;s how to take more <unk> properties of those properties into <unk> ."
this is another example .
"well , those <unk> makes some of this power ."
"he makes a message about it now , and maybe to do it slowly ."
"but a critical point he does this : whenever you decide you do a thing , you don &apos;t choose other things ."
"and they may have a lot of <unk> of traits , and they &apos;re going to be making a lot of different <unk> ."
third one : <unk> of expectations .
this was a <unk> <unk> by me to want to <unk> my <unk> <unk> .
"so i <unk> <unk> , almost all of the time ."
"and there was a time when they were just a <unk> kind of <unk> , and they &apos;ve got bought , and they were <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> , and they had been <unk> enough and they had a long <unk> , they were pretty much better , and they started to <unk> . &quot; they said"
"so to buy new <unk> after the age of <unk> , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some <unk> , i &apos;d like to have a little bit of it , here &apos;s my size . &quot;"
"and the <unk> told them , &quot; do you want to <unk> <unk> and <unk> ?"
do they want to ignore the <unk> or stone .
are you going to be <unk> with <unk> ?
"do you want to go close to this <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , &quot; and so on ."
"my jaw was down , and after i said , &quot; i &apos;d like the type that used to be the only way to do it . &quot;"
"he had no idea what it was , so i spent the <unk> all the <unk> <unk> and <unk> this <unk> -- and i &apos;m saying the truth -- to the <unk> <unk> i &apos;d ever have the ever had ."
i had better . all this <unk> made it better to me .
but i remember <unk> .
why ? i wrote a whole book about try to explain it myself .
"the reason that i was <unk> was that i was worse with all those available possibilities that the reason that i did for the one thing was a good <unk> , <unk> up ."
"i had a very low expectations . i had no concrete , like they had just in a kind of sense ."
"as a single person had come in a 100 different ways , <unk> to have a perfect deal with it ."
"and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect ."
and so i got to see what i had given to what i was the expected and what i had had been <unk> compared to what i expected .
it <unk> to the opportunities in human life that people will increase in expectations about how well they will be the potential .
"and that leads too much <unk> with those <unk> , even when the results are good ."
"none in the world &apos;s <unk> know this : because if you &apos;d , you know all of it won &apos;t be happening here ."
"the reality is , the more like this ."
"the reason that it was better than anything was bad for everything was worse , was that it was possible for humans to do the experiences that was kind of surprised to do a little surprising ."
"today , in the world in the world we live , we have to be wealthy citizens , <unk> citizens with <unk> -- the best one for that you can hope is that things are so well as people are expected ."
you will never have <unk> <unk> because your expectations of my expectations are <unk> .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what you get in for : the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
"i want to talk to -- a quick moment of -- i &apos;m married for by a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful ."
"i couldn &apos;t have better , and i couldn &apos;t <unk> me ."
but <unk> isn &apos;t always that bad thing as it .
"eventually , a consequence of a bad sign of a <unk> when there &apos;s just a way to buy , that if they are <unk> , and you ask yourself why , who &apos;s <unk> , that world &apos;s right ? what you can do ? what should have ."
"when hundreds of different kinds of <unk> are available , and they have a <unk> that is <unk> , and they ask why , who &apos;s in mind ?"
"so it &apos;s also clear that the answer is , it &apos;s the question ."
you could do better .
"with 100 different kinds of <unk> in <unk> , there aren &apos;t a <unk> for mistakes ."
"and so , if humans are making decisions , and even the results of decisions are good , you feel disappointed of <unk> you might be listening to themselves ."
clinical trials in the same world in the last year and the last generation .
"i believe a <unk> -- not the only one thing but the most amazing <unk> to this <unk> , the depression and also <unk> , that people have learned the <unk> because their <unk> are so powerful , and they think they have to explain it ."
"and so the <unk> is that in general , it &apos;s about better , <unk> , and we feel bad ."
so let me leave you .
"and this is the <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re all <unk> in right , completely wrong . that &apos;s not true ."
"there &apos;s no question that &apos;s a bit more serious than no longer , but it &apos;s not <unk> , more than anything else , than that ."
there &apos;s a <unk> amount . you can &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;ve been pretty sure that for a long time to get this point out of <unk> our <unk> .
"now , as a very <unk> question -- i &apos;m almost completed -- as a <unk> question , thinking about this thing , and what all that gives you to this <unk> <unk> in the developing communities is the wealth ."
"there are lots of places in the world , and we have heard a lot of you who don &apos;t know their problem is <unk> ."
"you have a problem , you know , you &apos;re too small ."
"so the things i talk about the speech is that a strange problem of modern , rich societies , are the most exciting ."
"so what &apos;s so amazing and <unk> -- steve <unk> , he &apos;s told them yesterday about how to fail and not to <unk> , so it &apos;s an <unk> of money ."
what i &apos;m telling you about that is that that <unk> complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that don &apos;t help them .
they even do <unk> .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re doing more expensive .
"if something about what makes people make so different decisions about our society that the societies that people who have too <unk> would have <unk> would not just be <unk> the life of people , but in our way , our dignity would become improved ."
economists call this an industrial <unk> .
it will make you know that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of the big <unk> we <unk> .
"now you &apos;re reading this kind of thing , and i think of that <unk> , and it &apos;s an advanced person , say , &quot; ah ! what does this fish do ?"
they don &apos;t know anything like this . &quot;
"and <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of the world -- and that &apos;s like i &apos;ve learned it first ."
"the more i was thinking about it , the more i came to view of that the fish know something ."
"because the fact is that when they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> so they &apos;re possible to do this , they don never have freedom . they &apos;ve got about paralysis ."
"if you break that <unk> so much it can reach , you get a <unk> ."
they <unk> the paralysis and reduce the <unk> .
any <unk> needs .
"it &apos;s almost limited to <unk> , and possibly for the fish , definitely to us ."
"but the <unk> is actually an <unk> <unk> , and , i suspect , disaster , disaster ."
thank you very much .
"you know , i &apos;ve spoken on some of those projects before about , about the human genome , and what it would mean , it would mean , and what it does , to explore new groups of genes ."
"actually , we start by a new point : we &apos;ve <unk> biology and now we &apos;re trying to create from the digital code in a new stage of biology by creating new life ."
we &apos;ve always been trying to think important questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something that i think that many <unk> have tried to figure out and to make this in different scales .
we &apos;ve tried different <unk> of <unk> to keep it <unk> with the components .
"we &apos;ve got to get between 20 or so that we sequenced the <unk> scan , in the changing world of <unk> biology in the digital world &apos;s future ."
"now we &apos;re trying to think whether we could <unk> lives or do we can create new lives , from this digital universe ?"
"so this is a map of a small organism , <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s an smallest genome has <unk> the itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to achieve that with a small genome ."
we &apos;ve managed to <unk> to a hundred genes of the 500 of them or something that &apos;s here .
"but when we take this <unk> map that we look very simple , that it &apos;s compared to how you , you feel that &apos;s easy . but as , if we look to all those genes we &apos;re <unk> to a different cell ."
"and so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to move forward , to this <unk> is to actually make the <unk> that allows us to vary the components and give a couple of those <unk> of the questions ."
"and so we started talking about the question , can we do a <unk> process ?"
"so it enables the chemistry that really to make these big molecules that had done before , what was never done ?"
"and if we can , we can actually start the <unk> ?"
a <unk> is just one piece of <unk> materials .
our steps in the process of life was exponentially .
"our ability to write genetic code has been <unk> very , but yet to have been <unk> , and our final point would be now on a <unk> curve ."
we started out in 15 years ago with it .
it took quite a few years from starting with a <unk> <unk> experiment before we made the first experiments .
and it turns out is a really <unk> difficult .
"there are tens of thousands of genes around the world to make little bits of dna , 30 to 50 letters for 50 letters but in the world as one single more of it is the amount , the more mistakes happen ."
"so we had to develop a new paradigm of which we could put those little pieces together and put them together , and do the mistakes ."
"so that was our first trial , we started using digital information , and the genome <unk> x <unk> ."
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria that kills .
"we built little pieces , and we made a <unk> molecule of about 5,000 letters ."
"and the <unk> phase , as we took this piece of <unk> <unk> and we put it into a <unk> <unk> , and it <unk> to read the genetic code , and then <unk> <unk> particles ."
"the bacteria were <unk> by cells and then <unk> back , killing and killed e."
i just talked to the <unk> and told them the model that they would actually <unk> the very best .
they were more than their <unk> here .
"and so what we think that this is a context in the software , in the software , actually , the way that our own <unk> can build in a <unk> system ."
"but we wanted to take a lot more . we wanted to do a more complicated piece of <unk> code , so we started , we did , to build it into the size of the genetic <unk> , and to change the size of the brain , the size that is the tumor the individual <unk> of the"
"design is the key of the key to start by using digital information in the computer , and you need to be really a really powerful information to the technology ."
"when we had sequenced the genome back in 1995 , the <unk> was a 10,000 number in terms of 10,000 degrees ."
"we found <unk> in <unk> of 30 errors . if we used <unk> sequence , they &apos;d never been possible ."
"one part of this process is to make these little pieces that are <unk> and to <unk> the other <unk> of <unk> <unk> , to make smaller <unk> <unk> that fit those together ."
we &apos;ve got unique elements here in this .
you may have heard that we built into <unk> .
"think about it : we have this <unk> code : a , c , <unk> and <unk> ."
"and so that <unk> <unk> these letters -- these letters are about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s one single <unk> to each one of the amino acids ."
"so we can use the genetic code to write our words , <unk> thoughts ."
we &apos;ve got <unk> in the beginning .
some people were disappointed that there was no word about it .
"we put those pieces together so they could just <unk> them with <unk> <unk> , so there &apos;s some of the <unk> these things that we could fix and get back ."
"and we started building bits , starting with <unk> <unk> letters , <unk> letters into <unk> , to make those <unk> to make these <unk> to get back up to <unk> ."
"so in each step , we created these pieces in the box , so we could make them <unk> because we tried to create a very complicated process of making what they &apos;re going to see in a minute ."
we tried to get the point of <unk> .
so this looks like a <unk> .
"if we &apos;re getting into this really big bang -- about 100,000 <unk> -- and then those aren &apos;t going to grow down e. , it all of those <unk> of modern <unk> , and then we went to be able to bring other <unk> into the <unk> ."
we &apos;ve known from a <unk> called the <unk> <unk> that &apos;s used biology to fix dna that can produce these pieces of pieces .
here &apos;s one example . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> that <unk> <unk> three million <unk> to radiation .
"and you see in the top , that his <unk> just is not even <unk> ."
"12 to 24 hours later , all <unk> started to do it as it was ."
we &apos;ve got thousands of organisms who can do it .
"these organisms can become very <unk> , you can even live in the lives ."
"so i &apos;m sure life in the kitchen and can move to <unk> conditions , in a sense of <unk> terms ."
"in fact , nasa showed that there is a lot of it out there ."
"and here &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s made by the molecule we &apos;ve used these <unk> -- we actually used just using the right design of the design of the piece that &apos;s in <unk> , and we &apos;ve <unk> it up with them ."
"and that &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> ."
and it &apos;s a big molecule that we can actually see it from the face .
this is pictures of six seconds from six seconds .
that &apos;s the world we &apos;ve been doing recently in the last couple .
"this is about <unk> letters of the code , and it &apos;s the biggest molecule that &apos;s been <unk> to some of people &apos;s own ."
it has a <unk> of <unk> over 300 million .
"when you put it into an airplane <unk> of 10 and you had to <unk> the amount of gaps , it would take <unk> sides to make this china ."
"now , what do we start by doing a <unk> <unk> ? how do we get it ?"
obviously it &apos;s a virus that it &apos;s very simple with a virus ; it &apos;s much more <unk> with bacteria .
"and it &apos;s just as easy as to do in <unk> as we do : you just take the nucleus , and you &apos;re put a <unk> into it , and that &apos;s exactly what you all heard about the <unk> ."
"so in the <unk> , the cell <unk> in which is simply embedded , and we &apos;ve just shown that it &apos;s a complete <unk> of a <unk> of a cell can do to other than that would be able to do it ."
"we <unk> the <unk> of a car company , which were <unk> these two <unk> apart , like people and mice , and we were able to pick a <unk> of it to it , and we made it in <unk> , and we were quite <unk> a <unk> . that . that it was <unk> it into <unk>"
the new <unk> was going to the cell .
"in fact , we figured that that this is the end is this , but we &apos;ve tried to bring this to try and bring it out ."
this is the most important evolution .
"we &apos;re looking at all species here the <unk> <unk> or a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , each of those days , <unk> into one second ."
"so people who have imagined evolution as a gene has made changed much of biology at a time , so many of biology ."
"there are <unk> called the <unk> is that are actually using dna , which is actually what dna is ."
the <unk> that was in the cell . the chromosomes we have already got it in .
and it was turned into <unk> and recognized the other as <unk> material that was <unk> and the way we had one cell with one new cell .
it <unk> blue because of the genes that we have in it .
"and by a very short time , it had lost all of the species and <unk> fully <unk> into a new species based on the new software that we have in ."
"all these proteins were <unk> to the very membranes -- as we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> ."
"it may sound like the atlantic , but we can change the flow of things , things really dramatically ."
so i have an invitation that &apos;s not the <unk> -- this is based at <unk> billion years .
and i &apos;ve been so convinced that we might be able to create a new form of <unk> <unk> that there could be a huge new <unk> based on this digital <unk> .
why should that do we do that ?
now i think it is quite obvious to what we need .
"so , we &apos;ve been <unk> for nine billion human beings over the next 40 years ."
so to put that through the context of the story i was <unk> .
"today , three people on this planet for each one of the year has been <unk> ; within 40 years , they &apos;re just four ."
"we have problems with <unk> , with <unk> and <unk> water , medicine , cost billions of people ."
it becomes one challenge to offer the nine to nine .
"we need over the five billion tons of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> billion <unk> , which are hundreds of millions of <unk> of <unk> a day ."
if we think about biological <unk> or replace any process that &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
"then , of course , the whole carbon from this kind of energy , is <unk> the inside of this atmosphere ."
"we have now , from our discoveries across the world , a database of about 20 million genes and in the way , i want to believe that the <unk> of the future of a future ."
"the <unk> had a mile that <unk> , you see the diversity of that came along from the world ."
"we &apos;re in this first line at a very first line that we &apos;re moving towards the limits reality , and that &apos;s what you think we have ."
we &apos;ve got <unk> technologies today on this rapid scale to doing what we call <unk> genetics .
"well , now we have a way to build a big robot that can make up the millions of dinosaurs ."
"if you &apos;re thinking of these 20 million different genes or building these <unk> on <unk> to create <unk> drugs or drug <unk> , we &apos;re only <unk> with a small team we can change more than the last 20 years ."
"and it &apos;s just the <unk> <unk> . we can <unk> <unk> out <unk> , <unk> from chemicals , or <unk> <unk> ."
"this is a <unk> shot of <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re actually <unk> , with actually <unk> and new species of design <unk> ."
"you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it will look like what it &apos;s going to look like to the genetic code ."
we &apos;re going to focus on the fourth generation now .
they recently have learned to <unk> <unk> about what just a bad experiment is .
"we have <unk> <unk> <unk> , and third generation generation , that have been going to have relatively increase <unk> of <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , or different types of <unk> ."
"but , as we think , the only way of biology is to make the huge impact with no other <unk> of the cost of its cost , or to be the cost of their <unk> , as the co2 is to look at that cells , the cells ."
"and we believe we &apos;re going to take the first one and the <unk> of the fourth generation , and that in about 18 months ."
"sunlight and co2 , is a way of the technology ."
but in our discovery of the world we have all the types of <unk> .
this is one organism we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
"he lives in the <unk> , about <unk> miles , in almost <unk> <unk> ."
it <unk> co2 from <unk> in <unk> using hydrogen as the energy .
"we &apos;re seeing if we can use <unk> carbon , which could be <unk> and <unk> , <unk> the carbon emissions in fuel to power ."
"within a very short period , we can be able to <unk> one of the fundamental questions of life ."
"you know , we have really -- <unk> targets like the <unk> of all this space industry -- exactly , if you &apos;re not going to do at ted , where anybody is to get a <unk> of the energy to the power ."
"but also , that &apos;s how we are working on the same <unk> that we have to use of <unk> to the development of the <unk> ."
"you &apos;ve been to seeing this year with the flu , we &apos;ll have a year on the back of it , and we &apos;re have an <unk> when it &apos;s going to go back to the real vaccine ."
and i think that &apos;s going to happen by being made by making a <unk> <unk> in the brain .
"so what the future may possibly be able to look like to change today , <unk> can be replaced with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , <unk> , and perhaps perhaps <unk> ."
we &apos;re making <unk> <unk> to people . the goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to survive . thank you thank you .
and i gave an <unk> at the recent talk on the <unk> ted .
and i promised to get you to explain what this machine works .
"so , it &apos;s <unk> , and for those of those of the people who weren &apos;t , they were the most <unk> scientific trial that have ever been given -- 27 miles in the <unk> ."
"its challenge is , to create the conditions that <unk> less than a <unk> second , at beginning of the universe -- and that &apos;s <unk> to 600 million times a half ."
it &apos;s just <unk> .
"so , this is the machine underneath the <unk> ."
we take images of these <unk> in <unk> in northern <unk> .
"i work on this one . he called the <unk> -- at least <unk> <unk> , 3,000 to 22 meters of the <unk> ."
"this is a <unk> view of the actual image on the construction , so it can see the most complex ."
"the <unk> year <unk> year , the machine was the machine , first time ."
and this image was taken from actual we did .
there was this <unk> <unk> in the control <unk> .
"this is an image of the first <unk> <unk> , which <unk> its path , and <unk> it to a part of <unk> <unk> , to let an ice <unk> out of the <unk> ."
"in other words , if we saw this image on <unk> on september , we knew that this machine works , this is a large <unk> ."
"i don &apos;t know if this was the biggest <unk> , or this , as a person who was going to visit google and the <unk> as they got <unk> like that ."
it means we &apos;re <unk> an cultural impact next to science <unk> .
"there was a bit later a billion minutes to do with this one that <unk> with these <unk> here -- this golden <unk> here , and that <unk> <unk> ."
those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> if the machine goes in <unk> .
"and so , the engineers under you will look at them and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t do it . these are little bit <unk> . &quot;"
"they may afford to make that because when they get it very far , they &apos;re called it <unk> ."
"so <unk> minus degrees degrees , <unk> as the space between these stars , those <unk> <unk> can <unk> the <unk> ."
"there were one of the connections , between <unk> that are <unk> that magnet in a <unk> magnet ."
it &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> suddenly <unk> resistance .
this happened .
now this is all more exciting when you think that there &apos;s 20 tons of that 24 pounds around about <unk> .
so we took about 50 of the magnets .
"and they had to take it away , what we did as we do ."
"we <unk> them , they <unk> them ."
they all are back to their way .
"by the end of march , the <unk> will come again ."
"and we &apos;re <unk> to bring it back to the june or to <unk> , and put our journey on , put out of the universe , and we &apos;re going to <unk> out how the building of the universe is ."
"well , on a kind of <unk> , of <unk> , the <unk> kind of <unk> debate around science and <unk> at the boundaries of these boundaries . it &apos;s easy to get something out ."
"i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard is to <unk> beyond our boundaries , we &apos;re going up , creating things like this ."
"i &apos;m going to give my <unk> english <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , which i suspect as the <unk> experiments of his father , his <unk> , <unk> michael <unk> , says , &quot; there &apos;s nothing more dangerous for <unk> of human society , to the <unk> ."
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
"books are <unk> by writing my job , but it &apos;s more like that ."
"it &apos;s also my big , <unk> love and <unk> ."
and i don &apos;t expect the ever to change .
"however , <unk> is a bit strange <unk> in my life and my career that has taken me to rethink my work ."
"this funny event happened , i just wrote a book to write a book -- an <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- romantic love -- that decided another one that i decided to do , as many of my previous books , were a great <unk> and <unk> ."
"the result is that when i &apos;m going to come to where i &apos;m treated , i &apos;m treated the <unk> ."
"serious , the <unk> <unk> ."
"for example , do you take a whole worried about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t they never get that successful ?"
"have no fear of <unk> they made their whole life , and never create a book in the world that &apos;s not interested in ?"
okay . that really makes courage to get <unk> .
"but it would have been worse , if i didn &apos;t remember it , i had to talk about 20 years before i first said when i first got to say that i had a writer , i wanted to be given the same type of <unk> response ."
"people say , <unk> <unk> you have no fear to have never succeed ?"
you &apos;re not afraid that you &apos;re <unk> <unk> ?
"did you fear that you &apos;re <unk> your life and you will never happen to something out and you &apos;ll die on an <unk> <unk> , your mouth <unk> with your <unk> <unk> &apos;s pain ."
"that &apos;s about , you know ."
"the answer is , the short answer to all these questions : <unk> is <unk> ."
"yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all this stuff ."
and that &apos;s what i always had .
"and what i do was , i did more things i didn &apos;t know the <unk> ."
algae -- other <unk> things .
"but , when it is for the other , i think about it , and ask me , why is it ?"
is that good ?
is it <unk> that someone should be thought that he was afraid to do that he &apos;s done to do the <unk> ?
"and what is the most powerful about <unk> that they make us <unk> about the <unk> of labor -- in some kind of , the different professions ?"
"my father , for such a chemist , and i can &apos;t remind myself of a child in his 40 years as chemists to think he was being <unk> , as he &apos;d made a chemist ."
"you know , with your <unk> -- and how to do you ?"
she was not <unk> ; did you know ?
but it &apos;s fair to have -- the group of chemists have not <unk> people about the argument of <unk> people .
"but we seem to have <unk> this sort of call it , but it &apos;s not only the writers , but it &apos;s the creative <unk> of the <unk> to have it seem to have that <unk> , <unk> ."
"all the things you need to do is <unk> of really great heads alone from the 20th century , watching , that were young and often died of her hand ."
"and even those who were not <unk> <unk> , <unk> , they actually <unk> their talents ."
"norman <unk> said briefly before his last interview , <unk> every of my books have killed me a little bit before <unk> . <unk>"
a key statement they can do about your <unk> .
"but we don &apos;t even realize once we hear something like that , because we &apos;ve know the kind of thing that &apos;s been familiar with such a long time . in some way , we think the notion of creativity and <unk> is so on -- that it -- and <unk> , by the <unk> , in the"
the question i want to put every one in here today is that one for you completely <unk> ?
"you &apos;re feeling about it ? because , just an inch away from -- i feel like i &apos;m not likely to think of that perception at all ."
i find them <unk> .
and i find them dangerous . and i &apos;m not trying to see how it will get over into a next century ?
"and i think that &apos;s better , when we live in our great creative <unk> ."
so i definitely realize that it &apos;s been -- i think very dangerous -- i &apos;d like to start <unk> out this dark <unk> of the kind of guess -- in a particularly the way i &apos;ve ever <unk> in my career .
"this is -- look , i &apos;m rather young . i &apos;m about 40 years old ."
i may have even <unk> 40 <unk> in me .
"and it &apos;s really , probably that all i am being asked by now in <unk> from the world as the job work that came out after this book of my book was right , right ?"
i say it <unk> because we are all friends in this one thing -- it &apos;s probably very likely to be that my great success is behind me .
"oh , jesus , what a thought about it ."
"these are the kind of thought to get someone &apos;s thoughts at the morning at <unk> , to drink the <unk> . i don &apos;t want ."
i would rather do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
"and i &apos;m going to be that by a moment of <unk> that i may have a way that they need to continue writing , some kind of <unk> <unk> ."
"so in some way , i &apos;ve to find a way that i write a safe distance between me and i would , to be a <unk> of the way of what the <unk> is going to be ."
"while i looked at models for this research for what i did , i also looked forward to the past , and i &apos;ve tried to see other societies , to see how they may be <unk> , or how better do it , as you might have better design ideas as better , as we have , or"
that &apos;s what <unk> made me look at the old <unk> and the old <unk> .
"please ask me , because the circle goes back ."
"but people in the old , and <unk> didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from human beings , okay ?"
"they thought that creativity had been a <unk> of <unk> that comes from a distant , <unk> source out of the human being come from <unk> , <unk> , for example ."
the <unk> called the two <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is known that he meant to have a <unk> <unk> who kept him out of <unk> .
"the <unk> had the same idea called this sort of creative creative spirit , <unk> an <unk> <unk> ."
"that &apos;s great . the <unk> really did think that a very <unk> , was a special individual ."
"they thought that a <unk> creature was this kind of <unk> creatures that believed in their <unk> lives , <unk> , in a <unk> of one , like <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> was the <unk> and the work in the <unk> ."
that &apos;s brilliant -- it &apos;s the distance that i spoke by -- it &apos;s talking about -- the most <unk> who protect you from that <unk> .
"and anyone knew that so worked , really , right ?"
"the <unk> artist &apos;s <unk> , <unk> <unk> about things , like , how much to be a lot of <unk> , right ?"
"if your job was brilliant wasn &apos;t you could look at everything for you , everyone knew this <unk> , you &apos;re going for that <unk> , who &apos;s helped you to do it ."
"when your work <unk> -- not completely your errors , right ?"
everybody knew their <unk> was a bit more successful .
so people have really thought of <unk> about creativity .
"and then we got the <unk> and all the <unk> and changed , and we &apos;ve got this big idea and this big idea , let &apos;s make the human individual <unk> to the universe -- for the <unk> , the <unk> , and there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> of the space for her hair ."
"it &apos;s the <unk> of rational <unk> , and people started to think that creativity was completely made out of their individual individual ."
"and the first time , you hear people hear it or artists , what they call an <unk> <unk> -- instead of getting that it &apos;s a <unk> ."
i &apos;ll just share you : &quot; i think this was a huge mistake .
"you know what ? i think that you &apos;re going to enable somebody to think you &apos;re going to think it or be a <unk> like the <unk> and the source of all <unk> , <unk> a small <unk> , <unk> , you &apos;re a little bit a little bit ."
it is like someone to <unk> the sun .
"the <unk> , and the <unk> were <unk> , and it <unk> all those <unk> expectations to success ."
"what i think is that this <unk> , that <unk> has <unk> <unk> our <unk> for the last 500 years ."
"and , if this is right , -- and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question ."
can we change that ?
maybe in an <unk> understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of <unk> .
maybe not .
"maybe we can get <unk> from 500 years from just so , not simply <unk> in an idea of <unk> talk ."
"and there is a number of people in this audience that really would <unk> <unk> <unk> about the <unk> of this idea of -- essentially -- that people would <unk> , <unk> and <unk> in their projects and etc ."
i will not all be able to take these trip into this journey .
"but the question i want to ask , why not ?"
why not think of this ?
because it makes you much sense of anything i heard from when i &apos;ve heard about trying to explain to make it absolutely crazy <unk> of creative <unk> .
"and one process that -- as everyone knows that has ever tried to make something -- which in other words is , actually , no matter how to be <unk> ."
and he can <unk> sometimes <unk> .
"i recently had this kind of <unk> to the american american <unk> <unk> , who was now 90 , but her whole life , and she said she &apos;d me to her her <unk> <unk> &apos;s landscape in the <unk> &apos; 60s , and she &apos;d like she went out the <unk> the road on her farm <unk> ."
she would say it was like <unk> train off .
and the land they would go over and be <unk> .
she felt it when it came up with the earth was going to put the <unk> under the <unk> .
"and she knew you had just a moment to do it , and that &apos;s -- in their words -- <unk> race , the <unk> , like the devil ."
"she &apos;s <unk> like the head for her house , while she &apos;s been <unk> by this poem , and it was only only because they had to get a piece of paper and <unk> to turn it through her by she to <unk> ."
"on other hand they weren &apos;t quick enough , they got <unk> and they <unk> , but they didn &apos;t <unk> the house , and their poem goes through her and she <unk> , and she <unk> , she said , she was taking over and she said , <unk> , she <unk> , &quot; she <unk> her <unk>"
"and then there were these moments , i never forget that part of them -- she said that there are times moments in which they were almost <unk> ."
"so , she <unk> the home , and she &apos;s looking for the <unk> , she &apos;s running through her , and she &apos;s just <unk> by her and she said -- she was like , she said , and she was able to bring them back and <unk> her hand ."
they opened the poem to his <unk> and <unk> it back into their body and took on a sheet of paper .
"so , in that opportunity , the poem came from <unk> and <unk> to paper -- but backwards -- for the first word ."
"as i thought that , i thought that was <unk> -- that &apos;s the very way that my creative process is happening ."
this isn &apos;t like my creative process . i &apos;m not the channel .
"i &apos;m a hospital . i have to work for working every day , i &apos;ve got to stand up and stand up , and get <unk> , <unk> and really <unk> to me ."
"but even i <unk> that thing , sometimes , in my <unk> , sometimes , i have this thing ."
and i think many of you have done it too .
"even i &apos;d have worked , or have been , ideas that come out from a source through me that actually i can &apos;t identify ."
what is this kind of thing for one thing ?
"and what are we going to get through the relationship with our minds with no more about it , but to actually keep us <unk> , even with mental health ?"
"for me , the best living thing is to do with the musician to create what <unk> tom <unk> did -- i met it for a couple years ago ."
"so we were talking about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life was tom &apos;s embodiment of tom <unk> , trying to <unk> these <unk> of creative <unk> <unk> into him and with her ."
"but it was turned back and <unk> . and he told me to go in a <unk> <unk> in los angeles , and then it changed for him ."
"he <unk> with high rate when he suddenly heard a little <unk> , the way it &apos;s <unk> , that is much hard for <unk> to <unk> . he wants to . he &apos;s <unk> -- he can &apos;t <unk> ."
"he &apos;s not having a piece of paper , it &apos;s not <unk> , he doesn &apos;t have a breath ."
"so he starts to start this old <unk> of <unk> , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be lost by this song ."
"i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t <unk> them . &quot;"
"and instead of falling out , he just stopped ."
he ended up running through all the <unk> and did some new .
"and he just <unk> around the sky and he said <unk> , you don &apos;t see i &apos;m going to watch the car ?"
"<unk> are i seeing it as if i just <unk> a song , &quot;"
if you really want to be to come back and come back to an <unk> time when i could care about you .
"if they &apos;re not going , <unk> , anybody today ?"
"go and <unk> <unk> , <unk> ."
his <unk> <unk> <unk> changed for that .
not that work itself . that was a lot of the way that &apos;s <unk> and the <unk> .
"but the process , the hard ones that spread it around it was <unk> as he <unk> out where he was there to no <unk> of where it had to get him in order , he knew it was not a <unk> ; it didn &apos;t <unk> ."
"there was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> collaboration , a kind of conversation about tom <unk> , and with the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which was not very <unk> ."
"as i heard this story , it also changed a bit like i was working , and it was saving a little bit ."
"this idea , as me , as i was <unk> in the middle of <unk> , my <unk> , love , i noticed that i grew in this <unk> in which we all fall to work when we &apos;re working on something and it <unk> ."
"not just bad , but from all time ."
"so i started thinking , i should just <unk> that project ."
"but then , i remembered by the good door , how tom had started in <unk> heaven , and i tried to get ."
so i study my view of <unk> and talked about a dark corner in a space of the corner .
"and i was talking to <unk> , <unk> to you , <unk> , and i &apos;ve got them and i &apos;m both know , if this book &apos;s not brilliant , it &apos;s not really my fault , right ?"
"because , you see that i have everything i have , <unk> . i don &apos;t have that anymore ."
"so if you want to make it better , you have to sit down here , and make your share of the end of it ."
"okay . now , but if you don &apos;t <unk> it -- you know what the hell you go ."
"i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job ."
and i want to get <unk> that i was here today for my work in the world . <unk> <unk> .
"because ... on the end , it &apos;s as an <unk> -- before centuries ago , there have <unk> people on the <unk> with <unk> with a <unk> and <unk> and music that were <unk> up for hours , and for the bottom up of a <unk> ."
those are <unk> were always great because the <unk> was professional and they were fantastic .
"but then again , very <unk> , something special happened , one of the most amazing people actually got to <unk> ."
"and i know you know what i know , i mean that , because i have all of you in your life , you &apos;ve seen one such a <unk> ."
"it was when the time <unk> and the <unk> were going through a kind of <unk> , but he was not making anything unlike it before -- 1,000 times a <unk> , but it had gone all along ."
"and suddenly , he didn &apos;t get a more in <unk> ."
it &apos;s been <unk> off by <unk> and down from down and <unk> and everything was <unk> through a <unk> fire .
"when something happened then , people knew what that was , and they called it ."
"they put their hands together , and they start singing : <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god ."
"is this god , you know ?"
"interesting historical <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> took this <unk> <unk> , they brought it to me the <unk> , the <unk> , over the centuries of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of food and still to hear <unk> ."
"when a <unk> in spain has made something <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great <unk> , there is it : an amazing sense of god ."
and that &apos;s awesome because we need this .
but the next <unk> <unk> in the morning when your <unk> <unk> up and <unk> that it &apos;s 11 o o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he didn &apos;t care longer as a <unk> by god .
"he &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> , it may never be <unk> to this <unk> <unk> ."
"and may not even be <unk> again , call it <unk> , but what to do he do with the rest of his life ?"
this is really hard .
that &apos;s one of these <unk> <unk> for a creative life .
but perhaps you don &apos;t have to be so <unk> by the <unk> you didn &apos;t believe that the <unk> <unk> of your <unk> is coming to you .
"if you just believe that you &apos;re a <unk> -- by one <unk> <unk> source for your life that &apos;s <unk> on somebody else , when she did it ."
"when we begin to think about it this , it &apos;s all about it ."
"so , i began thinking , and i think that i &apos;ve been working with security in the last few times , that &apos;s going to be working soon -- as dangerous as the dangerous , that <unk> would be a <unk> of my <unk> <unk> ."
"so what i &apos;ve got to say , when i &apos;m going to go crazy , is not fear ."
it isn &apos;t <unk> .
just make your job .
"and yet , to the contribution is that the <unk> would be whatever ."
"when your job is dancing , <unk> ."
"so when the stupid music <unk> <unk> to you , the <unk> , <unk> , a short moment for showing you a <unk> of wonder by your <unk> , then <unk> <unk> !"
"and if it doesn &apos;t dance , the dance still , though ."
and <unk> <unk> ! for everybody of you all .
"i think that i have the feeling of feeling , we should teach this ."
"<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , despite this , just for sure that you &apos;ve <unk> the <unk> of human love and the <unk> that you &apos;ve got for ."
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
"last year i showed these two slides to <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which had <unk> for three million years the <unk> of the <unk> of 48 percent to be <unk> , for <unk> percent ."
"and it doesn &apos;t push very strong enough the <unk> of this particular problem , because it does not show the <unk> of <unk> ."
"in a sense , the <unk> <unk> , our most <unk> heart of our global health ."
they <unk> in winter and <unk> in summer .
and the next slide i &apos;ll show is a picture that &apos;s happened in recent 25 years .
the <unk> is <unk> with red .
"as you see , it <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , it turns out to be the <unk> ice in the winter ; it &apos;s <unk> in the <unk> ."
"so this so-called <unk> , five years older or older , it almost has the blood that &apos;s gone from this body ."
"in <unk> years , it will be gone from here ."
"this is a problem with <unk> the <unk> reason for <unk> ocean , where there are large amounts of carbon from <unk> <unk> , which if he <unk> from microbes to <unk> ."
"versus compared with a whole amount of mass <unk> in the atmosphere , that amount of amount of amount can double when we get that critical point ."
"today , <unk> in some flat sand in alaska is from ocean water from the ocean ."
"professor <unk> , who &apos;s in alaska , in alaska , in one <unk> , has gone to another <unk> sea , <unk> past last winter ."
wow !
"your mind is good . you know , the question is , how is it going to <unk> us ."
and one reason is this huge <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> from north .
it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> are far greater than ever .
this is the flow of <unk> in <unk> .
if you want to know what level of <unk> you go through here in <unk> you see the sea .
the rivers are taking <unk> .
"on the other end of the planet -- antarctica , the biggest largest <unk> in planet ."
last month <unk> scientists that the whole continent now has a negative <unk> .
"and the <unk> <unk> <unk> across is very , particularly very long as it <unk> ."
"this is 20 feet , which <unk> like <unk> <unk> ."
"so in the himalayas , <unk> <unk> , you see new lakes that were <unk> in <unk> a few years ago ."
40 percent of people on the world are getting half of their <unk> from this .
"in the <unk> industry , it &apos;s this <unk> of <unk> for the city ."
the <unk> <unk> up .
"but when you get it up , the most <unk> water will <unk> the way you get ."
"in california , a <unk> <unk> <unk> at <unk> the sierra <unk> ."
this <unk> in the <unk> .
but the predictions they have read how they &apos;ve read about it are seriously .
that <unk> in all world leads to a <unk> <unk> .
and the world <unk> everywhere in a really <unk> have been <unk> and never <unk> any unprecedented <unk> .
so <unk> <unk> as much as in the last 30 years in the <unk> <unk> .
this is a completely <unk> of <unk> .
"when you consider that in historic context , you can see what it is ."
"in the past 5 , we &apos;ve taken about 70 million <unk> tons of carbon -- <unk> 25 billion tons every day every day ."
"look at the middle east eastern <unk> , of the indian continent and both both <unk> of india <unk> , where there was a central <unk> of water in the ocean ."
"the biggest factor for global warming , <unk> to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the burn of fossil energy emissions ."
"now <unk> is a problem , and coal is the biggest problem ."
"the united states , the two are the largest <unk> of the two <unk> together with china ."
"and the <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> to build ."
but we begin to see a change .
"here are these who were in the last few years , <unk> with a number of digital alternative that was being <unk> ."
<unk> <unk> is one of a political debate in your country .
"and the <unk> and <unk> spent one <unk> <unk> dollars last <unk> in order to provide clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself ."
i made this picture remembered for something .
"and the christmas <unk> around me , at home in <unk> , is a billion <unk> <unk> out ."
you saw it in the news in the messages .
this is in our entire country of the <unk> of america .
that was about the christmas place .
so one of the <unk> of christmas <unk> was this .
the <unk> <unk> of <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
"and it gives us the pollution and more <unk> in america , and it &apos;s helping our business ."
"<unk> , <unk> , <unk> is <unk> a <unk> <unk> every day ."
he &apos;s <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and workers remain in the <unk> and bread .
this is the source of coal in west virginia .
the <unk> <unk> of <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> coal .
"so let me just tell you a whole clear story : al gore , nancy <unk> , harry , potter , you know not what you &apos;re talking about ."
so the <unk> for the <unk> has been <unk> in life .
"this is one , one part of you ."
so in the <unk> <unk> we see as a serious danger to do the business .
"and so we &apos;ve been <unk> to the village , a <unk> <unk> for taking a <unk> on the way to bring the truth to the truth ."
and in fact it is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s <unk> -- and it also <unk> well .
"so , don &apos;t worry about the <unk> ."
keep it quiet .
"<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of that ."
"so you &apos;re going to do a tour of this modern one , <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
fantastic ! that machine is pretty <unk> .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean <unk> .
and still the burn of coal from one of the most expensive things to global warming is that the remarkable <unk> clean <unk> that you see right here .
"and look at it the same thing , this is the problem that today , clean <unk> ."
"finally , the positive alternative in the <unk> , for our economic challenge and our challenge of national security ."
"america is in a crisis , economy , the economics , <unk> safety , the <unk> ."
and the red <unk> who <unk> these together is our <unk> <unk> on <unk> of the <unk> of coal and <unk> oil .
"but the question is now a bold , new solution to <unk> us from this <unk> ."
<unk> <unk> of <unk> electricity to <unk> <unk> for the next 10 years .
"and a plan , back to get the work to make a safer and to help make a global warming go on ."
"finally , a solution which is large enough to solve what we have ."
"<unk> america , <unk> . figure out more ."
this is one the last thing .
it is about <unk> .
"a fastest way of <unk> our <unk> , our <unk> , <unk> , <unk> our world , to reduce ."
the future is here . wind ; sun and a new <unk> .
new investments to create good jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
"there &apos;s a old <unk> <unk> : &quot; if you want you to go fast alone , just go ."
"and as a matter of time you want , go together . &quot;"
"we &apos;re going to have to get way away , and it &apos;s very fast ."
thank you .
"and i &apos;d like to do with this , you know how they were to take time back , when they were at <unk> ."
"while she realized how to <unk> the hands and the <unk> , and the <unk> , they actually <unk> and , they were actually <unk> and <unk> the problem of understanding the <unk> <unk> of <unk> ."
the <unk> thinking is really <unk> connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
"and as a while , inspired by what we do with real objects about this kind of <unk> and i was working with my colleague and my colleagues <unk> , i began to wonder -- when computers would we use as a <unk> on , how on a <unk> , and how much , a <unk> on the chinese"
that question was so <unk> we decided to study the answer and we were going to build <unk> .
"and in a moment , a more <unk> computer is a interactive <unk> ."
"and they &apos;re able to move with the hand , they can perceive each other , they can detect their movements , and they have a screen , and they have a <unk> ."
"most importantly , are physically , therefore you &apos;re capable of <unk> <unk> out by the hands of the hands and access ."
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of go to go from going to the vertical digital data .
"and when these tools become <unk> , and an awareness of the movements , each one will recognize and the ones we have to recognize each other , then we can begin to <unk> with them with a new and <unk> <unk> ."
i start by just some simple examples .
"this <unk> is a <unk> <unk> , and if i go towards a direction , the video is coming forward , when i go to the other direction , it goes backwards ."
and this three-dimensional portraits take each other .
"so , if i put that next to you , it <unk> your interest ."
"if they are surrounded <unk> , you &apos;ll notice this , or you can get nervous out of that ."
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and <unk> .
"a really interesting kind of <unk> about what we started to see is that we could apply everyday gestures on data , how <unk> in how to do this in terms of interaction with <unk> ."
"in this case , we have three <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to <unk> color in the middle of the middle , where they &apos;re <unk> ."
"if it <unk> it , we can do a little bit of <unk> ."
"and also , you have got some nice possibilities in education like languages , or <unk> or <unk> , where to give the <unk> possibility of quickly and you want to see the results ."
here &apos;s me -- i &apos;m a <unk> that i have with a simple <unk> .
"so that &apos;s the game with the internet , which is a kind of <unk> and a sort of <unk> and <unk> ."
"you &apos;re essentially going to get all <unk> <unk> letters to each <unk> , and in order to form words you are trying to make this <unk> for the dictionary ."
"so , for about 30 seconds , <unk> and then you have a new <unk> , and you have a new opportunities ."
thank you .
"and so this is a few kids who came to an <unk> lab program , and i could move it to it , and i took a video ."
they have real time <unk> .
a more interesting thing about this type of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people to many instructions .
anything you have to say is &quot; forms . &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another one people test to use .
that &apos;s our <unk> <unk> there in the lower right here .
and it turns out he was <unk> <unk> .
"so for him , they were just <unk> ."
this is a interactive interactive girl .
we wanted to build a <unk> for <unk> .
that &apos;s an english <unk> .
"it &apos;s able to bring new characters into the scene , by <unk> the <unk> from the desk , the character , the shape ."
here &apos;s the sun <unk> off .
this is the sun .
"now , he <unk> the scene into the scene ."
and that &apos;s what the <unk> <unk> .
good work . yes .
"so by putting the <unk> into each other hand , and you can put them into the characters ."
... his own story .
<unk> !
it &apos;s a story with <unk> and it can make a <unk> that it is developed .
flying cat .
"the last example , for which i have been <unk> to show it , is a <unk> for <unk> we &apos;ve recently evolved as as <unk> sounds such as <unk> as <unk> <unk> and as <unk> ."
any <unk> <unk> of four <unk> . you can pick up what you want to use .
"and you can put these <unk> into the sequence , which you could <unk> in any pattern again ."
and they were just going to <unk> them by just holding a <unk> .
"and there &apos;s effects that are living , like <unk> and filters ."
"you put it into a certain clay , and it <unk> to <unk> it ."
and yet even <unk> effects like the speed and <unk> that you &apos;re going to take on all of the sequence .
so let &apos;s look at a look .
"and we &apos;re starting <unk> the <unk> in two <unk> and this one in a series , they <unk> and they extend a <unk> to the voice ."
so i &apos;m going to give you a van .
"and now , i &apos;m going to do something more <unk> to that ."
and now i &apos;ll connect with my <unk> so i can <unk> life from effect .
i can <unk> the whole sequence of <unk> by <unk> one to one other direction .
and i &apos;ll just combine the <unk> again with the <unk> . for some more expression .
and i <unk> that sequence as you go through .
"i don &apos;t plan to plan them in a <unk> , but you can make <unk> , you know , <unk> <unk> or <unk> ."
and so i can <unk> all the sequence by <unk> the side by the left .
thank you .
"so as you can see , i &apos;m here , my desire to develop new <unk> that make the better fit of the brains of how our brains are working and bodies ."
"and i &apos;ve had a bit of that kind of <unk> to you , and some of the possibilities of what we &apos;re working with in our laboratory ."
and the notion that i want to give you on the path is that we &apos;re on the threshold of this new generation of <unk> to interaction with interaction with digital media that bring into the world that we bring in our own <unk> .
"thank you ,"
"and i &apos;m very , really look at the conversations with you all right ."
"yeah , good day ."
i look very <unk> i &apos;m here .
"yes , what to be more <unk> about ?"
"i have to do this a few times a bit , and i &apos;ll be interested in the <unk> in general ."
"i <unk> <unk> , and i just began to <unk> for a few years now and have started that because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to do it in particular , and i was trying to do what i was learning in <unk> <unk> ."
so that &apos;s what my <unk> motivation was .
"so it was a curiosity and i just wanted to start to get into the matter , like that ."
"i think that the general economic growth in general now is all about the general languages , there &apos;s absolutely biotechnology , everything that you &apos;re <unk> to , <unk> biology and so on ."
"extremely important is important now , even a lot of time , much more important , is going to be <unk> in future ."
so there is such a kind of <unk> things like this all around these <unk> plants on the <unk> .
"there are now craig venter in the field who are trying to make <unk> , so <unk> from algae ."
"so , under that there &apos;s also things that are completely <unk> in the everyday life , but which is not aware most people are , just for example , <unk> <unk> that let us , with degrees <unk> , are <unk> too ."
and the list can still continue <unk> .
"and so the <unk> of interest in this technology , i &apos;m just on a <unk> there ."
so what &apos;s now <unk> ?
most people know that they know most people know that of the <unk> .
"so computers are <unk> , and so it will always go into the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere and <unk> the data and so on ."
"so , in a sense , it &apos;s really sad because it doesn &apos;t even hit what it actually <unk> the right and what &apos;s actually right there ."
"that is what the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , started out with the food system , and that &apos;s what the internet was going to have ."
"and it is about <unk> , creative , <unk> , <unk> ."
"and the problem that is not just an issue , it can be also a technical problem , it can also be a <unk> , as what things <unk> , so that a <unk> , a question , you can do as well , what you can do ."
"and it &apos;s just been <unk> with software , but there is also in the <unk> , there is also one whole <unk> , <unk> , making all kinds of <unk> things ."
"and now , wait to this direction towards biology , i want this metaphor to take off the biology of synthetic biology , biology is actually a <unk> because the <unk> code is not as a piece of code as it is not , it is in the same , it ."
"but it &apos;s also a code , and you can <unk> this as well as it can also <unk> it , and so i found that i &apos;ve been incredibly efficient , and i was just trying to have a lot more deeply , just <unk> , <unk> ."
"it &apos;s actually <unk> , actually , eight , really , thought , is the <unk> ."
"since that &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is originally <unk> , that has been around to europe and an idea of cooperation in india , but now , <unk> members of people who have had active anywhere in the world ."
"and that is a more artistic <unk> , so they are <unk> and <unk> and <unk> with technologies to do <unk> with these kinds of technologies and ask questions about <unk> and so there &apos;s some possible process . there &apos;s <unk> and so , you can do things on there ."
but it &apos;s actually always about to get such a <unk> to have a <unk> access to having a <unk> <unk> .
"and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ."
"this is a network of the <unk> , which is actually more like a type of forum where you hit and over online ."
"and they &apos;re a little bit of technical issues , and they &apos;re a bit <unk> going , because they &apos;re then , you &apos;re <unk> questions ."
"and <unk> from the dna that came together all this <unk> has made it , just a scene , that i want to do a <unk> <unk> for a minute ."
"here &apos;s the <unk> on the left , you see that &apos;s a <unk> , which is , basically , sort of a school in principle , a <unk> school , a nonprofit institution where anyone can reach ."
"children , old <unk> , all kinds of people get to go there and <unk> , they put a laboratory around the lab and look at what these <unk> can make ."
"there &apos;s a group on the upper left here : <unk> is called that , and that &apos;s pretty long as we &apos;re doing ."
longer than those two networks .
"also , in such a <unk> of a artistic aspect of materials , and also <unk> , combine to combine it in some sort of <unk> ways ."
"and they &apos;ve been a group of <unk> from college students that i &apos;ve taken for a while that &apos;s a <unk> that would want to teach them what they &apos;ve done to teach in college to learn , and they &apos;ve <unk> them so little <unk> to small people , and so <unk> them ."
and i have up at the top of another picture a lecture in medical history at <unk> university with a show of the <unk> issue .
"and that is -- yes is actually very young people , but the only thing that one really <unk> a <unk> is that this is <unk> <unk> in technology ."
"and what you can do with it , and also you can have to ask yourself <unk> to the society and say , so , okay , you know what <unk> you &apos;re doing , you know how much you <unk> to do so ?"
"so , <unk> , to now <unk> biology , you have to kind of stuff ."
"you need biological materials , and you need materials , but you need tools , and then it &apos;s a lab ."
"well , whatever you don &apos;t understand , in a laboratory , that &apos;s sort of a kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely <unk> , only for <unk> , academics with <unk> <unk> , and so on ."
"and our approach , to say , well , <unk> , that actually , you don &apos;t need to do the stuff ."
"it &apos;s really not necessarily because everyone has a <unk> developed , actually , has evolved technology as the most <unk> , that &apos;s really ."
"and <unk> <unk> with this <unk> with this <unk> , then , for example brian <unk> , tried to <unk> <unk> in england , has a <unk> , <unk> , so <unk> , and <unk> , and then <unk> bacteria , is working together , <unk> ."
"so each time that &apos;s been an <unk> soup that he stopped for too long , even before it is ."
"and i tried this in my lab , i got a little bit <unk> at home and i put it on ebay like this , and made a little bit of a <unk> <unk> analysis , so on for that <unk> and so on and a little <unk> home ."
"now , this was not really a joke , you know , but ."
"on the bottom of this picture you see this in <unk> , in <unk> , so that &apos;s a <unk> garage with , even with <unk> <unk> that the college has brought a group in paris in which has been so well , and pretty much things that &apos;s pretty much did , and what has done in what"
"and this is <unk> , who also mentioned <unk> <unk> , this one , as well as <unk> in <unk> biology , in fact , of <unk> biology ."
"and yes , and you know , it &apos;s relatively <unk> , so there &apos;s a <unk> basis to people doing themselves at home , so far more , the wait of a number of larger organizations that are actually <unk> in the form ."
but always the approach of this idea is that it &apos;s going to be just and available .
"so the first project we &apos;ve taken as international group , as we &apos;ve been able to aware of our own own ourselves there are here as real , as we &apos;re at online and we are online and so on ."
"and then we had the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and i told <unk> , we &apos;ve also got to meet , too much of the real , and there &apos;s two <unk> in london , a <unk> , one day after a half in <unk> ."
"and then , we also go about that , yes , you know who are we , you know , what are we like to do what we want to share ?"
"what we are our values , and what are our <unk> , our <unk> , our based on ?"
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got a little bit of a <unk> <unk> .
"it was quite intuitive , so everybody just have his <unk> like this , and his <unk> to put him up , put it up ."
that &apos;s when i think of a good <unk> .
"and then we have this not <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> , i think that &apos;s already a pretty <unk> <unk> <unk> people are quite convinced to be there ."
"and we actually tried to <unk> the world again and turn it , but it &apos;s kind of not like that ."
"so i think we have a step out of the world , in some ways , we can actually go further than the <unk> world ."
"yeah , what to projects we do so ?"
so one project that i did with the <unk> in switzerland myself was to have a so-called <unk> <unk> device or <unk> device .
"so that &apos;s when you focus a <unk> , into an area , then you can draw those little particles of particles in the air , or in that liquid , and then , so there &apos;s a <unk> , like a <unk> like that &apos;s so on ."
"this really works , which is being done in an academic <unk> , and we then thought , <unk> , perhaps what we &apos;ve got , we have a <unk> , and we &apos;ve <unk> that &apos;s <unk> , which is a <unk> , a microscope , that has a <unk> ."
you can see that in the bottom of the time .
and we then <unk> a <unk> <unk> and the laser <unk> the laser <unk> and then try to focus on the camera .
"and it &apos;s clearly not working , but we have learned a lot about it ."
"so another project that came out of the french group there , this worked out there that worked really pretty cool ."
"and that has the one so , which is that sort of a <unk> or so , <unk> , you know , that way to play it with a <unk> is , his <unk> is sam <unk> ."
"and he turned this helmet into the helmet and he had this keyboard around , and in cooperation , the museum went through the museum ."
"there were , you could see the <unk> <unk> in the room , <unk> in this chair , put this helmet in ."
"then they were used by <unk> , and as they used to have thought or how they thought they have been different lights into the room ."
"so , there was a pretty <unk> project ."
"another thing from the united states that also has to do with these things as well , is the <unk> , which is the equivalent of the <unk> , complicated word ."
"so it &apos;s about just <unk> and copying genes using <unk> , <unk> <unk> so that you can do it ."
"so , if i &apos;m going to do the <unk> of the <unk> and then go up , collecting the <unk> , and then then you &apos;re going to turn this method , and then you &apos;re going to say , <unk> , this hair is so on that kind of this hair ."
"and the machines which are doing something like this is rather <unk> that you buy commercial , the <unk> are going wrong with the amount of <unk> ."
"and this is not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology , which is very much , too much ."
so that &apos;s just an application of many that you can do with that .
"and there are two <unk> of the things that have been doing and <unk> that we &apos;re doing a lot more and cheaper and then <unk> <unk> , so , <unk> <unk> <unk> , so that &apos;s <unk> , and actually <unk> this device from them , and the <unk> are <unk> are the one of the <unk> ."
"well , i think of something as <unk> dollars or something like that ."
"but it &apos;s still not easy to it , but it &apos;s certainly in any case in <unk> where it &apos;s <unk> <unk> ."
so it &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> to me .
one project i started to build was to a project of the <unk> .
"<unk> is , yes , like a sort of <unk> , that &apos;s about as far as a <unk> , two or a meter ."
"they &apos;re <unk> <unk> , and then the <unk> in these <unk> and then i took them <unk> to <unk> them , and then <unk> it to <unk> it ."
"and so , the device you saw is that not working ."
"but that &apos;s as my intuition , which is quite <unk> , which looked like an <unk> <unk> , the thing that <unk> on there and <unk> it and was a pressure that was up with pressure ."
and then i took a little <unk> and i put it on it .
"a <unk> , when you get to the <unk> of water , it &apos;s a degree , so i think of the <unk> until <unk> bar it ."
and you can put the particles strong enough and then the <unk> into the <unk> .
"and the commercial device cost about <unk> from north or whatever , so to <unk> ."
"so , you don &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it is basically possible ."
"that is how much time the scene is at a moment that the scene is beginning to grow this <unk> and also increase the information , and increase the information , and the <unk> of the more people can be involved in there ."
"because the beginning of the <unk> , it &apos;s a extremely important technology , and most people have pretty little , and also rather than a lot of it , to make it well ."
"because , you know , if you &apos;re just reading , from <unk> , that is not the same as if you &apos;ve done it or seen ."
and i think technology is going to continue to be more important in our modern societies .
"and when you think of an <unk> citizens can be able to put together <unk> decisions in society and you want them to be , you need access and then , in order to know , for technology ."
and you also have to have to do it and understand and understand it and understand .
and then the <unk> is <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so you &apos;re getting in citizens as a position for the other <unk> to <unk> with this scientific technology .
and that &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
"these are people who have officially used to go at least <unk> on the top , <unk> <unk> ."
and it &apos;s quite a relatively remarkable number of people around around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also being one in <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the way that there are fewer <unk> people than actually are .
so i know of some of these who haven &apos;t <unk> .
"and that &apos;s just the <unk> , the individual people ."
"partly with those <unk> , which places like this , have <unk> together ."
"and it &apos;s really , really , beginning ."
it was like <unk> <unk> .
"and <unk> , so the <unk> , because of the <unk> at berlin <unk> was the first , <unk> ."
"and it &apos;s a <unk> network that has come in very good , <unk> that are represented everywhere in the world ."
"and we hope that we have also , in the <unk> , and we have some <unk> to do so similar , so that , you know , you know , that people will get <unk> out again ."
and i would have every time to go and talk to each other and also do what the <unk> would have .
"now it &apos;s not so simple , it &apos;s not that easy to do because , you have enough curiosity and enough energy , you get there ."
thanks for listening .
this is it .
"yeah , <unk> ."
how do we really make people work ?
"that &apos;s a question that &apos;s a very different kind of <unk> me , but also in the area , in the <unk> area , with all kinds of <unk> <unk> , in the field of data ."
"and it is about how to use a way that you get people in interactive media , so you can use this interactive media and create it a <unk> possible experience ."
"and i think that the interactive media in us is <unk> cognitive <unk> to <unk> cognitive models , so that we can <unk> in our <unk> , very , very long time , and we can create the interactive media through interactive media ."
"and that &apos;s very amazing , because you really believe that <unk> that you &apos;re <unk> , that you <unk> one in the future , but indeed it is that the future that is the bottom of us with the whole world ."
what are they really <unk> models now ?
"i &apos;ve been standing down to four <unk> , and i &apos;d just like to explain to you ."
"so to <unk> cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we have <unk> in the <unk> times ."
in this <unk> models we heard in the <unk> <unk> between the ratio .
so it &apos;s basically <unk> unusual .
"i &apos;ll go to this , and i will show you in some way that i find you that you have an <unk> relationship with what &apos;s actually ."
"the second aspect , is , since this case of design , we &apos;ve been really , very , very popular , even today -- we &apos;re using a universal language ."
and the third section that explains actually <unk> .
"and we all know that the interactive media is a <unk> by definition of definition , which means that of the <unk> , and of course what tells us that we <unk> the <unk> as normal ."
"the fourth thing is , that &apos;s where the <unk> is for us to get place the <unk> ."
so the thing about what &apos;s about . the reality that actually is the biggest story of the world .
and i want to show you a little bit of time .
how much how many doors has the house to live in ?
"and they won &apos;t answer me right now , but this will happen and is going on right now ."
"you go to the <unk> through this house , into <unk> , and look at how many doors are there ."
so that &apos;s what they do .
"she <unk> a reality , which is a computer in a way ."
"amazing , right ?"
"and then we &apos;re going to have a real <unk> to <unk> the virtual reality in our <unk> , and that we &apos;re actually going for a time ."
"and this wealth of the virtual reality , the most <unk> that people have <unk> in the <unk> times because they had nothing to do at all ."
they didn &apos;t have books .
they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they had no milk in .
the only one that had was your head .
"and in that mind , the memory fell out ."
"so in this head , <unk> , <unk> and using this virtual paintings that were <unk> had been passed away ."
"and therefore , it has been so strong that we &apos;re so <unk> with what &apos;s between ."
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that i have to make a little bit of a little trip .
"yes , that goes ."
"what &apos;s interesting about this is , at the course of that human time , <unk> and medium was itself ."
"so now , if you &apos;re thinking about a bit of a bit more ."
what are media ?
and then you &apos;ll notice that there has been a change .
but i go into that way again .
<unk> tool of <unk> have been known as a whole stories .
"<unk> , priest , <unk> , <unk> and were an extra <unk> for understanding in some stories ."
"and today we still spend very , very , very strong with stories ."
"the writer of the book on <unk> , jonathan <unk> , we still have to look for a year at a half hours with the most <unk> for stories ."
"that meant a kid to make it , to the <unk> of the <unk> that most of his lives had been spent with most of stories on my life ."
"now , we think our love to stories depends on the story we have sitting as a child on the lap ."
"no , no . far <unk> ."
and so this goes back to in the <unk> of the <unk> time .
"but i &apos;m really amazing , for me in the <unk> of interactive media , to me as an amazing media that we have in <unk> <unk> of memory , we have the ability to think of the ability ."
"i &apos;ve brought you an example of the american <unk> , the american <unk> team ."
and the lives living on the <unk> of thousands of <unk> .
"and as you see , it &apos;s very exciting area , and you kind of had to come from island to <unk> to <unk> to eat food ."
and they did this with what we call it in a <unk> .
they may know that if they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re doing a little bit more interested in the <unk> .
they have similar principles .
"they don &apos;t have a <unk> , they &apos;ve used to use <unk> or <unk> <unk> ."
and what &apos;s interesting about this was that the <unk> and the <unk> of regions had become related to songs .
where the language <unk> of <unk> was <unk> .
that means you &apos;re going to have <unk> about <unk> and rhythm .
"and these <unk> and this rhythm , the <unk> that <unk> an <unk> of an area , and that also has allowed them to put those songs in and be <unk> and <unk> and so on the left-hand <unk> , after the right , back ."
but why don &apos;t we sing more to the top from b ?
but anyway not to be too <unk> .
so what &apos;s happened there ? what is it happening ?
this happens as a <unk> condition .
we &apos;ve moved this <unk> from what we &apos;ve done before .
"it &apos;s happening that &apos;s happened , and it happens to be the book , and it &apos;s happened the <unk> ."
and that &apos;s what happened is that it has the responsibility for our <unk> and the its own production of our individual <unk> have been <unk> on other media .
on the book and the picture .
"and so , we &apos;re going to have some <unk> to <unk> <unk> ."
botswana is suddenly made to us <unk> to us and has nothing more to do in reality .
"bruce <unk> , an ancient <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> is so far saying that this <unk> is what this book is like , and the picture , not the web , on television , as we <unk> and what we call this brain model as a <unk> is now ."
let &apos;s do a little <unk> .
<unk> for the age of age . / / age .
what did we think of <unk> our thinking and <unk> our <unk> system ?
then they are <unk> <unk> to <unk> cultures .
"those are over the course of centuries , more and more of <unk> through the <unk> of <unk> ."
"that &apos;s what we realize by <unk> , we &apos;ve seen a best , far more <unk> of masses of <unk> patterns in <unk> that we can put our individual <unk> on ."
we &apos;re not producing more .
we have a <unk> language .
"we have to imagine the thing that doesn &apos;t work anymore in images , not in pictures , but we &apos;re <unk> them to our language ."
we &apos;ve got used to think that things happened <unk> .
and we have the most effective thing that <unk> is called the law and we &apos;ve only got one exceptions like this <unk> .
and what &apos;s left is the <unk> .
even more of the <unk> we are so hard to get arrested .
"the question is , what is now coming ?"
"we were having the most <unk> <unk> , we had the age and we were doing this so <unk> <unk> ."
and they &apos;re really <unk> and familiar with <unk> . i know it &apos;s very <unk> .
but the idea of <unk> that brings this <unk> to us to explore our skills back again .
"there &apos;s about monterey , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> ."
i want to explain a little bit of a .
"there are <unk> concepts like <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is called the extended reality ."
"so , for example , when they <unk> google <unk> , it is a concept that lets you take the virtual world with the real world , that is to take our <unk> , our <unk> to <unk> , to feel the virtual <unk> , a normal <unk> ."
one different example is the most <unk> virtual reality .
"and so , of course , the <unk> in my <unk> may sound , since we &apos;re actually <unk> to the existing technologies , virtual worlds , very <unk> to the <unk> ."
"and other examples have the online model of these are smart , intelligent systems ."
and these are rooms that may be intelligent at the person .
"that needs to be the ability to accept the basic capacity , which is a real habitat ."
"i &apos;ve <unk> and i hope to work the clip , and i &apos;m a very , very nice , really nice project that <unk> the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
and both the two <unk> are here .
and you can up the moment you &apos;ll stand up to get in the field with the two of the <unk> with the project .
"and this project , i brought up as for example of the <unk> , cognitive models of what i &apos;m doing ."
the whole thing is i have to tell .
"so what <unk> <unk> is extremely <unk> , which is a <unk> ."
"and when i say <unk> , they have a very likely to look at people who are likely to have <unk> <unk> <unk> or they have to play with any <unk> of the hand ."
"on all the way that , they do ."
that &apos;s a game <unk> out of the way .
and that &apos;s a great deal to make that i think the world &apos;s outside to go through the real world .
"and this game connecting the virtual world , so that data is the data that we &apos;re making with real world ."
i <unk> that i have to <unk> as much .
"you can tell this much better , and then you &apos;ll explain more about it in a lot more ."
and it &apos;s that i &apos;ve got the city <unk> by looking at which place was positive or negative .
"and so from the city , i &apos;m looking at an entirely different impression -- that i &apos;m looking at negative and familiar with a city , and in such this kind of <unk> , <unk> , a very different map of very , very real city ."
"and we can like this , we now like , like , too ."
"ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little bit of one explanation that you &apos;ll see right now ."
"of course , this virtual world in the walls , that &apos;s clearly <unk> ."
"and in a kind of <unk> , we can see these virtual worlds ."
"so i like to conclude the <unk> that my mind in the spirit that the properties and the skills that we <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , and the nature of <unk> <unk> is a little bit like the company that we can actually <unk> to our <unk> ."
thank you .
"well , it &apos;s very , i &apos;m very excited to be with you ."
"i was already given that <unk> is there a <unk> <unk> , and is going to talk about it ."
he &apos;s going to be <unk> .
i &apos;ll also get <unk> in what &apos;s inside .
"but now , i just do it again a little bit of curious ."
"yeah , children are <unk> by nature , or should be curious , designers ."
"so i &apos;m <unk> from home , so i &apos;m also <unk> myself with the subject of curiosity and how changing curiosity and how , and why , and maybe we have to be <unk> again and <unk> <unk> again and so on and so on ."
so this is a whole bunch of things that you &apos;re going to go to the actual existence as a long way to do .
"when <unk> become curious , you often get <unk> in like n <unk> ."
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been having in the last half a year .
so an issue of based on <unk> user interface interface with .
"now you &apos;re going to ask to ask why the <unk> begin to deal with this kind of natural , natural <unk> of communication , interaction interaction , and so on ."
"and i &apos;m only taking one of those small devices that things are <unk> because things should always be more intuitive , more <unk> , and there is a look at more than humans , which is , of course , what is <unk> or so ."
"and before the background , i <unk> myself in the field of <unk> art interface , the next generation in the <unk> , the <unk> person in the spirit of the person in the human interface to learn how our tools <unk> to the computer ."
so i have done a lot more about when i think or something or intuitive .
and maybe you have to look at that again .
why does it all happen ?
"so , if we look back to our society here , just right here , so we &apos;re moving away from the third <unk> in fourth <unk> or a <unk> ."
"so , from the modern <unk> in the modern world ."
every society is <unk> by a <unk> .
"at the beginning , the <unk> <unk> through language ."
"that means you &apos;ve found that when you &apos;ve been talking with a common language , you could communicate with each other , put into the same cave or other areas , a <unk> and put them together and <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"but the <unk> was a little bit more <unk> , something very <unk> ."
"you had to learn from learning , so you can &apos;t know what nature &apos;s been <unk> , but we &apos;re learning it to <unk> and <unk> , of course ."
"this was <unk> through the local society , and the first form of a <unk> form for the <unk> ."
"this was a <unk> at the time of a <unk> , and of course , as a living language , <unk> began with <unk> , called what is called <unk> , and it &apos;s alive and to <unk> it ."
"the depending i <unk> up and when i <unk> it is , of course it &apos;s a whole other than when there is some place ."
"but <unk> then also moved this <unk> as <unk> , <unk> ."
and then the next generation we actually had a more <unk> .
"and this is just the pressure , <unk> <unk> <unk> , with other people ."
"and it was an <unk> , where <unk> <unk> , and other people said , you &apos;re actually a <unk> , if people start reading it , then after the end goes to drive , and that is completely <unk> ."
"and now we &apos;re going to this next generation and the <unk> , so it &apos;s like a <unk> number of years , and we &apos;re really at the moment in that phase phase , that we are kind of going to be a lot of <unk> ."
"of course that <unk> us very , because we look at the side of one page , new media , social media and facebook foundation and so on ."
"with the <unk> transparency , which is what the new thinking about <unk> thinking , not necessarily that in <unk> and no longer , there &apos;s no other <unk> , or another , i want to go to <unk> , but i want the <unk> and <unk> ."
and these two worlds are <unk> of <unk> and new way .
"and the point about this is that when you &apos;re <unk> , the whole new society , that is that they have these <unk> , much of a lot of <unk> principles , and <unk> principles from the building that we &apos;ve <unk> ."
"but no longer is at a global level , it &apos;s on global level ."
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme ecology is a global economy .
"it doesn &apos;t when i think a <unk> locally , and the <unk> thinks about less <unk> , then this doesn &apos;t work ."
"this is what the local village is actually , a global village has become the same principles , of course , as opposed , to , in contrast , of the <unk> transparency ."
"so , you know how in the village , who has had what has with , when it happens today to their own energy <unk> over this mobile <unk> <unk> on globally . right now ."
"it was that we &apos;ve known globally have , and we have to have more and faster and more ."
so as they did before it happened in the village .
"now , what i got out to looking at is something called this , which is , because actually what is we have to , of course , what might also have been more comfortable with us but also , the kind of , what makes the difference ?"
because the fact is that common people do not <unk> can &apos;t do so much with everyone to do it .
"so you have to go around , and that &apos;s what it is , and you just change it that it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s going to be better ."
"and when of course it is intuitive , and as a result as a <unk> of this as well as i could use and <unk> that kind of as a <unk> that they are as a matter , so you &apos;re doing a little bit fun and simply to use ."
you &apos;re <unk> up again and you &apos;re also concerned with the subject of perception and the <unk> .
"and , of course , what you &apos;re starting and you start looking like , ok now , i can just just check inside your inner ."
and how does it actually look inside of it ?
so how do we work when we look at it there ?
"and what does that mean , of course , to our intuitive sense , and how does our <unk> <unk> of perception and how is this cognitive ?"
"because steve jobs have said , &quot; you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> ."
"so you really have to look at details when i want to do something <unk> or intuitive <unk> , what &apos;s called in the heart ."
"and you already see that you have a <unk> , most of our <unk> that we &apos;re just five , even now , is <unk> , there is definitely seven <unk> , there will be still in the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> to the next , <unk> ."
"and then look how do we use information , how do we take information on ?"
"to say , &quot; what is that for ?"
"information is that any difference , and that &apos;s a difference ."
"many uses this word , but don &apos;t even knowing what it means ."
"but i have to understand in the core -- understanding when it &apos;s being <unk> to information from data and information , from information , so i know how i can make things so much as a piece of intuitive , of course , or not <unk> ."
"and <unk> , of course , <unk> <unk> the perception ."
"we see this when i <unk> things , i can <unk> it up like on the right side of the page , i can &apos;t know what is salt and dogs , or i can show them in , by doing things , making stuff ."
"so much natural , in an <unk> , but i see the one straight thing , and it &apos;s salt and it &apos;s <unk> ."
"and if i can tell someone that was a salt or air , then it &apos;s being <unk> in the right <unk> of <unk> <unk> where it &apos;s in the right way ."
"and with the left , the simply <unk> access , and i hope that there is no sugar inside that there is no salt for <unk> ."
"but also our perceptions themselves , as <unk> , is it <unk> ."
"so , for instance , that perception in the context ."
"the right spot is getting bigger from the little , even though this &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re actually just too large , but they &apos;re also changing the perception of the way that we <unk> in context ."
anyone knows what that is ?
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> &apos;s should work .
"so it &apos;s <unk> , rather , in my <unk> ."
"so , it &apos;s <unk> ."
"a second circle has <unk> to <unk> , <unk> or to <unk> ."
"and when i &apos;m going to take one <unk> , we &apos;re still looking at an one <unk> , which is a <unk> circle , yet , but we can see a unit , we see , we don &apos;t see three parts ."
"you use that <unk> <unk> or you <unk> that <unk> we have , and it <unk> us with the perception ."
"important for the <unk> that have the first <unk> , the great <unk> <unk> ."
"<unk> near the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> and so far ."
"often in the third and , it &apos;s in the third ."
but this is a important part of the <unk> if you wanted to make things so much more intuitive .
"the next phenomenon , which is also interesting , the way of seeing it ."
"sounds very <unk> , but it &apos;s very <unk> <unk> to make a little bit more ."
"and we have <unk> and <unk> , and now we think from back to the back ."
that &apos;s wrong .
they look back from the back from the back .
"because they &apos;re <unk> an example of what they &apos;re looking at , what they &apos;re doing , they &apos;re <unk> a <unk> circle ."
"that means we only watch our <unk> until we see it back in our back to the home , to say , okay , ."
"i have this as <unk> cognitive <unk> , you have what you have to see ."
"that &apos;s the same thing , again , coming back ."
"and then it &apos;s <unk> after the <unk> right , because the back of the <unk> doesn &apos;t go , so , even please take a look , and sure , what you see is what you see , what &apos;s what you want to see ."
"and then back in the back , it actually will happen ."
"so , a very , very exciting process , how things are just about in terms of doing things that happen to you ."
i don &apos;t know who you know about this image .
and the same thing i &apos;ve <unk> you right now .
now everyone &apos;s trying to figure out something like this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who sees what &apos;s <unk> .
is there something <unk> ?
"a <unk> , right ."
"so if i saw that , i &apos;ve seen that it &apos;s a <unk> in , then you know ."
they &apos;re never forgotten because i &apos;m showing you where the <unk> is .
and so you see the <unk> .
"and on the other hand , and you &apos;ll notice it ."
"that means i did <unk> it now , to <unk> that they don &apos;t recognize any pattern , but i &apos;ve been looking for <unk> of that dog in a while and over again , in this <unk> picture ."
and that &apos;s a <unk> of looking at seeing <unk> .
"now i know <unk> and now i &apos;m going to the end of it , i see the <unk> ."
i see the <unk> .
"so , quite <unk> <unk> that then , in this <unk> , yes , is not really not , but here is in this kind of mass <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> ."
is someone who knows what three seconds is ?
"for <unk> , yes ."
that &apos;s our present .
"so also , to know interesting , as a designer ."
"when i know something takes three seconds , until i look out of the present in the <unk> , i can <unk> very well to <unk> in , and i can just go to it by giving you three seconds by <unk> ."
and that &apos;s where it &apos;s got to <unk> and present .
"then , growing in the past , and i can do a very <unk> in the computer for example if i knew this phenomenon ."
what <unk> <unk> takes ?
"yes , <unk> ."
"also , a kind of <unk> phenomenon ."
it is in the <unk> period that you know .
"so that means , if you know what you are now , watch on , who you look up with , because i &apos;ve been able to look , there are no one in what &apos;s going to happen in the way ."
and the <unk> <unk> . also a very <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s the <unk> that we have .
"so it &apos;s , this idea that the first one is happening in the <unk> fast how we perceive things ."
"and as we see stuff in which we &apos;re looking and how we can , in some sense , to the environment so that we can do to the other part of it ."
"of course , the <unk> are <unk> , not <unk> only about the topic of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> or <unk> , but also , of course , of course <unk> <unk> on the subject of <unk> ."
so as a human being is about in some ways to do .
"there are <unk> the <unk> of the functions , so that we put together the parts or two things ."
"there are <unk> where i knows exactly , actually where to reach the world ."
"and yet , there are also <unk> functions , but why can anyone make one small , where no matter anyway , what does it hardly <unk> on money , even though there &apos;s so essentially it is that it &apos;s not ?"
"there we are rather at the <unk> , on <unk> , with which we &apos;re also <unk> as a <unk> ."
"so , to the actual subject on the present <unk> user interface , and the theme , which also , of course , is a <unk> ."
"<unk> always means to me as possible , and i can reach to a very quick plan or how can an <unk> <unk> <unk> , as i can get to a very efficient <unk> <unk> , so it &apos;s a goal ."
"that &apos;s what the norm is , it &apos;s going to be the norm ."
how can i make some sort of the <unk> here ?
"can i use this directly or i need &quot; n <unk> , &quot; or i need the experience that i can practice , that &apos;s the <unk> ."
"and less <unk> or <unk> , it &apos;s it ."
"i &apos;m just doing it differently and <unk> , not that it &apos;s better for <unk> ."
you also have to understand it .
"and then , when you see the software that we &apos;ve seen on , you know , you also get to understand why <unk> percent of our software is in a <unk> , or not on <unk> in particular software , in a <unk> approach of software or <unk> ."
"and that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , for example , not only for apple &apos;s <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> if we &apos;d like to do technology <unk> ."
why ?
"because we have the general kind of <unk> , and so the natural user , for example , as five times as is , on average , we have to have a goal ."
"and they have to imagine that if they take something that <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , there will do five hours and <unk> this new kind of natural software just one hour ."
"it doesn &apos;t mean that you probably have about four hours home , but the company goes to your car , or your <unk> will be , just a way to run it with the four hours <unk> ."
"so i want to tell , for ourselves , of course , that we are <unk> in the ability of to have some sense of something about it ."
"so when we take back into the <unk> of software , so the <unk> <unk> <unk> interfaces , which have been very abstract , which you needed months to deal with these systems ."
"and the next person to talk now , <unk> model or <unk> model model , like the software has been working , was that you would have been an idea of something -- the metaphor that the metaphor to make a computer computer like computers ."
"so , not much anymore , and <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , but also a metaphor ."
that made it quite a lot of <unk> but also a lot more it is done .
so the next generation of <unk> is working very much more with behavior .
so i have a lot more often than the <unk> behavior of what the brain looks like .
that &apos;s actually an <unk> .
"i &apos;ll be on one once that looks like the <unk> for success , just the <unk> is going to be a <unk> ."
"and then if i &apos;m going to go to that <unk> , and put a <unk> of use by <unk> <unk> face , by a language , by language , by <unk> , as a mouse , and then i need it to be even more and still another ."
"but also , that &apos;s going to me again , when are things going to be more intuitive ? , you know ?"
"when they get to intuitive , and then i have to look again at my little , and look back , and i guess , what does that mean , because of the <unk> <unk> when really , now &apos;s something that particular ?"
"and this is a little bit more intuitive for ourselves , and i need to think about this in the very way ."
"so he &apos;s not like to think , but they &apos;re just doing <unk> ."
"the fewer i like to say , the more the more the , the so that &apos;s ."
"so , what does that mean for the designers ?"
"so that is called , if we look at <unk> that we can take <unk> <unk> from an <unk> to something different , like , the metaphor can i do that as a <unk> ."
"that means i could put such an <unk> , <unk> human , to software software and make this <unk> <unk> much more effective at the same point ."
"and of course , the question of what is actually , the way we have <unk> ourselves , and now i am to <unk> it ."
this is called the <unk> .
"that is using everybody from us and <unk> is an acronym and <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ."
"it &apos;s all of the time you &apos;re doing that -- but it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s basically , sort of , sort of , or <unk> , as a <unk> ."
"so , the model will be <unk> by the world &apos;s <unk> , so it &apos;s used in the world , so it works for a young and old , and it will be used by us without the time we &apos;ve ever known that this model ."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> will <unk> about each <unk> to us as much as they have to shape , so that you &apos;ve noticed in sleep , and so it &apos;s going to become less <unk> than day ."
"i can <unk> this mental <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> to <unk> it into the <unk> of a whole ."
"and by that sort of transmission , like the <unk> of the metaphor of the <unk> , but we &apos;re not going to take as a metaphor of a physical system , but a metaphor of a <unk> ."
"and that &apos;s in a higher grail of the <unk> of this <unk> of what the <unk> metaphor is , which is the <unk> metaphor ."
"and when i get to that , for example , when i &apos;m <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the event of me <unk> up to me <unk> -- i get to somebody in that detail , or , i can &apos;t <unk> , <unk> , <unk> it , or i <unk> ."
then i can <unk> all of that down .
i &apos;m trying this through an <unk> .
"and it &apos;s all <unk> , that everybody has a cake ."
"<unk> : so now i <unk> with the object , <unk> again <unk> ."
"and so i &apos;ll show you , i can <unk> <unk> by this all , and i can tell you just a show to me all the time with <unk> <unk> ."
"and once i &apos;ve <unk> an interface , which is much more intuitive and lots of natural ones ."
"because i can reach the things like the bits , you can <unk> and come out of me , is far more natural than about commercial websites , or some other <unk> of web websites , and any <unk> are so available to that ."
"<unk> &apos;s more <unk> than the phrase , and i &apos;d like to close with that sentence , and again , a clue to the <unk> , for designers have to do different solutions to new solutions , and in that sense thank you ."
let me show you a very different aspect of curiosity .
"the first , if you &apos;re getting the child , as a baby , it &apos;s that you &apos;re doing something that <unk> you have so on , yes , by depending on whether their parents have been allowed , to raise the more or less ."
and curiosity makes a learn to learn .
"all of those are the ones that are here and what are curious to do , that people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn ."
"i &apos;ll be basically all that stuff , like , you know , is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> years of <unk> in the quality of it ."
and there &apos;s one more <unk> point in it .
and the phosphorus depends on the phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
"every day , they give you <unk> , you have about two <unk> , each day , and each day you have to <unk> two <unk> phosphorus ."
you can &apos;t have any teeth else .
and they can &apos;t <unk> energy .
you can &apos;t have bones .
we can only <unk> the <unk> off the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t make phosphorus and make it <unk> .
"<unk> is the way we think about what a <unk> of what is , that it &apos;s not , but that &apos;s not that kind of a <unk> ."
"because all of you talk about energy , but there is no one talking about <unk> ."
the <unk> system is a lot of <unk> .
we <unk> on two countries .
"we &apos;ve only done for two years now , and yet , through the world &apos;s <unk> , we &apos;re being <unk> in the environment a lot of surfaces as <unk> <unk> as it is in all ."
"in just the last 20 years , the <unk> <unk> tons are distributed to in germany ."
we take everything out .
it &apos;s <unk> <unk> with children .
and we think we &apos;re going to protect the environment unless we &apos;ve a bit of a bit less <unk> .
"so for example , the environment , the environment , <unk> less cars ."
"<unk> the environment , make less waste ."
it &apos;s a <unk> environment that &apos;s less energy .
but that &apos;s not a protection .
"so , that is as when i say that i would go to your kids , it only takes five times more than five times ."
so there &apos;s a little less <unk> .
"so if we think about the <unk> to the <unk> , our entire earth will be used as a plane or a <unk> later ."
just thinking about the <unk> of thinking about being a <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as a <unk> .
"so the bottom is the surface of <unk> percent of the surface , it &apos;s carbon ."
"now , we build <unk> , and you &apos;re losing the <unk> between <unk> , 30 kilograms , <unk> per square meter per meter , or the <unk> sea ."
that is what it says that we &apos;re losing more than being <unk> .
"we can , of course , <unk> the <unk> ."
and all of that is in <unk> or content .
"for the reason in <unk> , 20 percent of the <unk> are <unk> , in <unk> ."
"and since we become older , we will get a greater ."
this is kind of a <unk> in the <unk> .
yeah ?
a baby needs an <unk> <unk> <unk> .
"we could reduce that to 10 percent , but what does it ?"
that &apos;s <unk> in china from a second .
this is a completely funny kind .
"so the question is , how do we go with this <unk> force ?"
there is one proof that for the way men have no pigs are pigs .
so i want to tell you that .
because the phosphorus will be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> with the solid <unk> .
people with the <unk> <unk> over the <unk> .
yeah .
and so men can &apos;t be germany .
"because that &apos;s so much <unk> , right ?"
"we think , in the <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re too many to go forward to the world ."
"if you &apos;re going to have the people that you &apos;re <unk> to do that when you &apos;re the <unk> , that &apos;s really not even better , you &apos;re going to get them <unk> and <unk> ."
"and so , somebody says like al gore , which is one of our big hero , there is nothing that has known as human population ."
"in israel , when you <unk> a lives , you <unk> the earth ."
"this is the more you say , the better you are ."
yes .
"and the first question is , is we really are too much ?"
"you look at the ants , the ant &apos;s ant <unk> on the earth , and then the ants weigh about <unk> more than we humans ."
"i can <unk> <unk> to myself , but in the united states , nobody may have been <unk> , in that far of the time , even though they &apos;re a <unk> ."
"and that is , they divided a lot more than we ."
"and because they &apos;re really much harder to work as we do , and they are only spent only six to six months , <unk> them in their <unk> energy consumption , in something more <unk> billion people ."
"that means we &apos;re not too much , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?"
"and you can see how far we could get away from that we wanted to do and , how <unk> could we &apos;re at all at all , in the earth , you &apos;ll see them that for example , a video show you there , <unk> there to 14 , <unk> ."
you can only do <unk> when you don &apos;t exist . right ?
the only one opportunity .
do you &apos;ve ever seen a $ a tree ?
yes ? right ?
one single ?
"that means that our whole intelligence means that we want to get <unk> than trees , yes ?"
yes ?
no tree &apos;s <unk> .
"fortunately , yeah , yeah ?"
they &apos;re there no <unk> at the <unk> .
"there are still <unk> billion trees in the <unk> , still in the <unk> ."
now have you heard about <unk> from trees in a moment ?
"that is , all your intelligence means that we will be a <unk> to trees ."
"and what you see even as <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> , has no way for agriculture to go beyond our own <unk> ."
every year we lose so about three million tons of phosphorus that really need to go back in the solar system .
and to that one of us are too many .
just around that .
"it means that we feel so <unk> on earth and we say , there &apos;s no waste , no <unk> , no <unk> , not <unk> , just as you can , which allow all <unk> back , our own <unk> ."
is not sad ?
that &apos;s too many .
it &apos;s secure sense that it &apos;s safe to be less <unk> to what <unk> in the field .
but where are we useful ?
"now we try to <unk> our <unk> footprint , but it &apos;s about to have a great footprint in it is that it is useful ."
"we want to be good for society , we want to be good for economy , but if that is in a environment , the highest , isn &apos;t that , you know , yes ?"
"<unk> , yes ?"
they only can have <unk> when they &apos;re <unk> .
"even if you were to go back now , you would have emissions ."
so they can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it different .
and we can <unk> our <unk> back .
we &apos;re doing in brazil in the <unk> of where we <unk> the <unk> .
"we can <unk> this kind of way into agriculture , <unk> , in agriculture systems ."
"the thing that we do to china , for example , is we take the right away from this <unk> ."
"in china , a <unk> <unk> is still <unk> to , so , you know ?"
"and within the world we were always stupid , to make our <unk> out ."
"this means that the whole western <unk> was <unk> by giving the city , the <unk> has never had a difference , but the farmers have never got anything ."
"and that &apos;s because cities had to be growing , because our farmers went into the cities , and then the cities had to get their <unk> out ."
"and all of these <unk> <unk> are always <unk> , and then they did that to infrastructure they couldn &apos;t have yet to have <unk> , and then they &apos;re <unk> ."
yeah ?
china was very different than china .
it has made a <unk> civilization for over <unk> years because you were able to make the problem that they &apos;re going to come back .
"even today , even though they &apos;re invited to food in kenya , in china , they would expect to eat for food until they fall to the toilet ."
because it &apos;s more <unk> to go and <unk> your <unk> out .
"they invited it to the food , not to the <unk> ."
so that means you can see on the internet and how you can get back your <unk> <unk> .
"and the beauty of this is that you do , so agriculture is making <unk> that <unk> on a land of <unk> in <unk> of <unk> , can <unk> for a farmer , so that it &apos;s waiting for <unk> a <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> and trucks and <unk> a <unk> ."
and the amazing thing is that the <unk> are <unk> to the <unk> over <unk> percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people at a <unk> way to be very much .
we can be support for them .
"so these things are <unk> , of course , and the hospitals are <unk> themselves ."
the <unk> is clean water .
"and they have designed so , through design , that &apos;s very <unk> to you , and the <unk> ."
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going back to do the front line .
"and there &apos;s no one from these facilities , and we &apos;ve now made over the last decade not over the last 20 years , we &apos;ve never been <unk> ."
you could just get it so easily a <unk> <unk> and then it would cost you about years .
it won &apos;t happen .
"that is , we don &apos;t need to control the people to be much <unk> in the same way ."
we can support them to be good .
it means we need to go up phosphorus .
"and by the way , when you want to figure out what you might find out , in germany , they &apos;re <unk> by all sorts of <unk> <unk> ."
"unfortunately , not the <unk> in zimbabwe , but maybe they can actually help the <unk> a little bit more ."
because the <unk> device might be <unk> the best <unk> .
and that has got to return .
we look at the phosphorus in fact that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see it &apos;s quite serious .
we &apos;re <unk> through three years now .
"the government of government , explained that they will be the first country worldwide , which is phosphorus <unk> ."
but we need <unk> all .
"understand , there are two countries that control <unk> about almost <unk> percent of the <unk> worldwide ."
there is a <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
these are <unk> countries that are <unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> .
and that <unk> oil is that we can replace by other oil .
but the phosphorus will not be able to replace .
"this is not about getting the existing a bit less good for you , but it &apos;s about making it right ."
and to be most <unk> about questions what is the right thing .
that means that it &apos;s about efficiency not efficiency .
"in <unk> , you can understand it , of course , because it is in any sense , it &apos;s built in flowers in flowers ."
yeah ?
"imagine if their wife is <unk> , when you get your wife , if you have them <unk> , and they get to <unk> with <unk> <unk> ."
completely very very <unk> .
"but even really effective , right ? right ?"
or take a ticket .
a woman in germany <unk> about six <unk> <unk> in your lifetime for her life .
and this is what they &apos;re doing .
"it isn &apos;t <unk> because it &apos;s not the <unk> , because we don &apos;t know how much is happening ."
"but one <unk> , self , even with the lighting , i can tell you , is completely very inefficient , but very effective , yes , right ?"
all of you in the lives is not <unk> .
"it &apos;s not that it <unk> , but efficiency ."
"to ask , what is the right ?"
"not to <unk> the <unk> a little bit better and burn it all of the <unk> and to lose all the <unk> to the energy systems for the <unk> , but first of the time , how does you <unk> our <unk> ?"
and think about <unk> .
right ?
"so if we <unk> them and say , &quot; well , there &apos;s a <unk> with <unk> , and then a glass of water ."
"so wonderful , right ?"
this is a <unk> .
all of the things that are beautiful in life is not efficient .
"if you put yourself into somebody in a <unk> , <unk> ?"
yeah ?
"that means that anything that matters is not about saving from trying to avoid , to avoid ."
all the <unk> .
"we &apos;ll tell the people , yeah , you don &apos;t have the <unk> in the south ."
"no , just that <unk> is right , right ?"
"at every point where you look at , yes , you create it , again , again ."
but the false things .
"if you look at that wrong things , you have a <unk> of <unk> ."
we are thinking from north .
there is an footprint of <unk> .
"if you run , yeah , you <unk> any footprint ."
because the same thing will be die down and the wind is going to <unk> and the water and the water is going .
"but if they &apos;re in italy , each footprint does have been that there are longer there in the meadow ."
"so , it &apos;s about creating a huge footprint that becomes a very <unk> ."
not <unk> .
we say in sustainability in sustainability .
yes ?
"but when i ask it , how did i get you to that hand ?"
what do you say ?
sustainable .
"then i say -- <unk> <unk> , right ?"
that &apos;s just the <unk> .
"so don &apos;t save , <unk> , avoid ."
everybody is <unk> <unk> .
"and it &apos;s a <unk> when you see it in italy , as people are <unk> at the high <unk> <unk> <unk> from the car , in order to get it ."
because they understand that that &apos;s a <unk> process .
"it &apos;s a <unk> form of <unk> , right ?"
"and you show me , i was there ."
"but with the right designs , you get beautiful ."
"we &apos;ve developed the <unk> system , which is <unk> fluid , that &apos;s fluid ."
they can go and <unk> them where they go and stand .
"in two hours , she is building them anywhere ."
"and it has <unk> seeds of rare <unk> , so they &apos;re making <unk> through the biodiversity ."
"that says we &apos;re useful , not so much of it ."
"so , there are two cars ."
not all of the <unk> is to be <unk> .
"a television and a <unk> that uses it <unk> it <unk> it , or they don &apos;t have ."
"just the things that are <unk> and <unk> like <unk> , like <unk> , like the <unk> you need to be so that they go to biological systems ."
the things that are just used to go in <unk> systems .
but we &apos;re just talking about the <unk> systems .
yeah ?
"for the example of the <unk> , yes ?"
"this is <unk> advertising , and not the business company by business , by the way that they are now helping this company to make these products successful ."
because we don &apos;t do things anymore .
right ?
"so if i say to you , i say , you have to eat <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> , it helps you do nothing ."
"no , we &apos;re <unk> in what &apos;s in here ."
good .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic <unk> in .
"it is all in it , which is useful ."
these are the first shoes you can get from those to the <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> can walk across biological biological and go to <unk> ?
all of this is a <unk> .
"and when it <unk> us , it <unk> us , of course , for nike , for nike , for the <unk> and <unk> , and the whole one ."
and this is half of all the <unk> in the world that are causing <unk> by the <unk> .
this is why they help people ask them to come up with people .
"hey , <unk> , you &apos;re really serious ?"
and they have already <unk> the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not so sure they really hate it .
"so , help me get a bit of it ."
but it goes .
yes .
"and that , which is exactly what &apos;s just <unk> ."
this is happening .
"now we can do the kinds of things that are , that if they <unk> when they are , they could go back into biological <unk> ."
and then <unk> are the same amount of energy .
they have this <unk> <unk> <unk> .
"this is the first <unk> <unk> <unk> , in fact , that &apos;s what &apos;s done , in <unk> ."
"so , the one thing you can do with is the things <unk> you &apos;re in every place ."
"if you come up on , yeah ?"
do they even remember the <unk> ?
"now , when it &apos;s <unk> ."
"all over this <unk> <unk> around , almost nearly ."
where the countries where people are coming in to money .
"there &apos;s the <unk> here , but else in the landscape , right there ."
"so when we change the plastics , so that we can go into biological systems when we change the <unk> , the inside , they can <unk> back at a time , they could take it with a baby in israel or in tunisia ."
yeah ?
"in all of them , when they take these <unk> , you take them <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> to plant trees ."
"and that &apos;s the baby &apos;s <unk> for all of life , even from the beginning ."
"so we don &apos;t need to make <unk> , we can be <unk> ."
"and it comes up with <unk> <unk> , print ."
"yeah , so ."
yes ?
so we can do these .
we can make everything even more <unk> .
and i founded a <unk> <unk> system .
"and there &apos;s a lot of people now working on it , and they all can get engaged ."
"there are extra crew , there &apos;s <unk> <unk> to where everybody can go on with it ."
"so , not more , <unk> , <unk> , prevent , not <unk> , but a <unk> , but intelligent ."
does she explain that .
thank you .
the job of the <unk> .
music as language .
"the description to my talk is written about that i <unk> as a <unk> , and so i understand at the english <unk> , that i understand ."
the written name is <unk> &apos;s written on <unk> music .
"you can &apos;t just say <unk> as a word for <unk> word into another language and also understand the attention of the words and <unk> , with it , it &apos;s got a <unk> <unk> , everyone has to do <unk> with <unk> with <unk> ."
"in fact , from <unk> to english , you can do more know about <unk> , because when they do go back to <unk> or to write poetry ."
it &apos;s from a sense of view in terms of what we &apos;re doing using our lab <unk> .
"so as a <unk> <unk> , i only got a title called the title of the name ."
and you &apos;re sure that the <unk> in <unk> have exactly anything that he &apos;s <unk> .
"in fact , the <unk> are very <unk> and anger ."
"they &apos;re just as <unk> as well as <unk> as an <unk> , though , as much as an accurate <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a landscape ."
"because in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the flowers are not <unk> to smell , the degree of the <unk> , the <unk> of the wind is not to hear , not feeling the wind ."
"and this means that the <unk> must be <unk> by the <unk> of data , and that &apos;s the other thing , <unk> , concrete , <unk> ."
"now , i want to share with you what else i would <unk> you with , so again , <unk> , in an extraordinary speech ."
"so actually , an <unk> from the <unk> ."
"that &apos;s why i keep doing the whole thing that &apos;s like being <unk> , because if i have to <unk> in english , it would be for me to <unk> to the <unk> of the earth &apos;s <unk> ."
so the music works for me just like the spoken language .
the <unk> grades have a <unk> of the letter of an script .
"so it &apos;s not to learn just <unk> , to know , and to <unk> the piano on that he or to have the right place on a <unk> ."
this is just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the picture of the letters is one time in which one can <unk> the language .
so in order to stop the music of the <unk> of at least for the long as long as the invention of language .
"and there &apos;s some point that <unk> , whether you learn how to do it , it &apos;s just an <unk> that you can actually talk , you can also have active activity until you &apos;re <unk> your favorite point in the <unk> ."
the work of <unk> starts <unk> like a <unk> .
"so once you &apos;re having a piece of <unk> , because you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> into <unk> the origin of <unk> ."
it &apos;s about information that &apos;s <unk> about the <unk> in the <unk> .
"you read in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or if we are words , you &apos;d think from <unk> self ."
and you studied the work that he &apos;s made out of front .
you <unk> .
"the question , the writing it ."
what is he thought of ?
"how did its <unk> <unk> , how society and politics ?"
all i &apos;m interested in .
"you think about in that time by looking at contemporary contemporary art , or literature ."
"and over time , you also have an <unk> , but you know , a <unk> about the <unk> that you play the <unk> , and it <unk> a <unk> to feel and feel <unk> ."
so the <unk> will always be more to the <unk> that you &apos;re in .
"his cause to write the piece , will always be more , more to my personal cause to play it ."
"all the <unk> are the precise <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , but just a framework , i now turn this framework to take a meaning and makes it meaning , with meaning , and to <unk> ."
i then say to my own word that might be made of the <unk> .
i &apos;m a games that can have those sounds .
"so for me now and for that time , what they could do today to make you feel ."
"everybody , each sound , each <unk> gets an <unk> to it because i <unk> it because i now <unk> it personally personally ."
"it has to be me here , and now i can &apos;t make my audience <unk> , but i cannot convince the one that this is my cause ."
"it &apos;s still a very <unk> concert , when i can have the experience , the piece that i would have made as much as it comes to <unk> ."
"you &apos;ve <unk> new new day , although you always take a lot of the <unk> of life , and the same <unk> of life , you get up , you know , you get the same , <unk> i <unk> the same piece in new ways ."
"i grew up a day of a time that &apos;s <unk> , so my <unk> walks at night when the morning , in a <unk> , it takes a long time to get back to the <unk> ."
"i guess that breathe true , <unk> , right or breast ."
"all that &apos;s influenced me , and it also <unk> my experience with the <unk> ."
"it &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s actually a <unk> when i stand up at mit , and we &apos;ve got a lot of time ."
"and then it goes to the same kind of in good , <unk> with conversation ."
you take a new hope in and you get that into <unk> with an reaction .
"it &apos;s fascinating , because it &apos;s what happens , and it &apos;s something we don &apos;t <unk> and what it can &apos;t take out of the same ."
they are doing great in this way of doing music and they have been <unk> the audience like the music <unk> alive .
"this is another concert , and every concert ."
and i &apos;ll never play more like this in the moment .
now i can &apos;t play as a 20 years of play in 20 years .
"i &apos;ll have a lot more experience than today , and therefore i will have my <unk> for the <unk> of the body that is more <unk> to emotion and the <unk> of the emotion than i do ."
"sure i &apos;m going to <unk> some <unk> , but for what new <unk> is ."
i have a <unk> example of that .
"it &apos;s on a <unk> for <unk> at my former old teachers , professor <unk> , a famous mathematician , <unk> and professor <unk> of the <unk> in there in <unk> ."
"unfortunately , i had been much too young that he was in front of the way that i finally started to study ."
"but i had this great happiness , which i was very early with , with <unk> , <unk> years from it , and so i &apos;d been to the <unk> of my classes ."
"i was <unk> , once , when i was in a class , <unk> on one <unk> , and the last one of the four <unk> of chopin was a <unk> ."
he asked me what the <unk> of this <unk> was to me .
that &apos;s a very <unk> part like this .
"and in my <unk> , i said , expectation ."
"he was talking about that , and was it ?"
that &apos;s got to be the <unk> <unk> .
because what &apos;s it means for me does it mean .
he has been <unk> .
"<unk> with <unk> , you &apos;ve been looking at their dreams but don &apos;t quite have the <unk> ."
"and i &apos;m going to play this whole number of years and have been seen as a look at me , although not the single one &apos;s one that has been moving ."
"every time it &apos;s fine , because again i read something new ."
one example of that in a totally different field -- the <unk> <unk> made a <unk> .
"it &apos;s always the <unk> <unk> but it &apos;s <unk> , different <unk> of light ."
"he translated out , to the <unk> <unk> , so how he &apos;d saw it , as you did at this point ."
and the individual &apos;s unique <unk> .
the interpretation of a <unk> is that it &apos;s like the <unk> .
"now , i &apos;ve <unk> older than the devil with seven years when he was writing that piece ."
it only lived for years to be a <unk> .
"and it matters to me to look at the grades over the high , even as i can tell you about it ."
"so <unk> to <unk> , to stop the <unk> ."
"because the <unk> , the only link to him is <unk> ."
"especially , when he &apos;s lost ."
"well , how do you start talking about the language of music ? ok ?"
"so i said already , &quot; you have got about it as long as the spoken language . &quot;"
so often the <unk> is that you can only learn about reading the grades .
you learn to just reading until you &apos;re just talking to a word .
you learn to find the sound of the <unk> on the instrument .
"and if you can take all the finger and right as it &apos;s in a <unk> , you get <unk> , you get <unk> out , you get like music ."
"as a <unk> happens , the students are going to get the <unk> thing ."
it &apos;s almost not being talked about the <unk> .
"well , there you see , <unk> , that &apos;s a quick little bit ."
"<unk> , slowly ."
"according to <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ."
most of them .
"but again , even when you get those data on , it still is something technical ."
"and yet , it &apos;s always a interpretation of it ."
i wonder .
i wonder that we often <unk> a little bit <unk> .
that means to make music on the instrument that they &apos;re alive and feel earlier before .
that &apos;s what sing .
"a child that doesn &apos;t learn , because the parents don &apos;t have any <unk> , it will be done in itself too ."
that &apos;s like <unk> .
"it &apos;s necessary to have its <unk> and the idea of the music , and then you know it about one more possibility , so it &apos;s a tool for taking the instrument to sound ."
"people have never seen the <unk> , and so have never felt instantly as if it &apos;s , the sound of being a sound ."
a <unk> <unk> with its own breath .
that &apos;s <unk> that &apos;s the <unk> of our bodies .
"our own chords , to <unk> our hands , our hands , <unk> ."
so the <unk> in the piano is the <unk> to my fingers .
the tune <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> and the rhythm of dance .
the <unk> <unk> of music today is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to do any more music if you &apos;re boring to do it .
no longer to sing or sing for <unk> .
each other &apos;s <unk> will be <unk> when you &apos;re constantly <unk> from music at the outside .
"and sure there are some of you in your <unk> , you say , but what if i can &apos;t sing ?"
"the question i &apos;m asking you , can &apos;t sing a , a , because you think they can &apos;t sing ?"
"or b , because they didn &apos;t learned that <unk> ?"
"they &apos;re not too late to do it , to figure out if they can &apos;t do it , or to learn how to put those little muscles that <unk> the vocal vocal <unk> are used , right ."
you can train that .
"or c because you have them <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> ."
"so , i &apos;m asking how <unk> was this diagnosis ?"
"do you have an amazing or <unk> <unk> , so you know it &apos;s now telling you ?"
"or d , they just like they don &apos;t have music , and you know , also want to do <unk> to do it with it ."
"but what i &apos;ve been thinking is regret because it &apos;s a nice , nice thing ."
but maybe you can also do it too .
"well , you know , at all cases , no one has to be an <unk> of the other ."
"but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t know the <unk> music ."
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or <unk> .
"there &apos;s an answer , but i can tell you if it &apos;s not ."
"because i don &apos;t think anybody says it , i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s not feeling , because i can &apos;t cook ."
"so they didn &apos;t eat the food , they couldn &apos;t cook ."
so you don &apos;t need to look at <unk> music because it doesn &apos;t play as an instrument .
"hear them too , and you say to them , it tastes or not ."
whether it &apos;s the music for <unk> or to look sweet .
tell the thing you feel .
"you can also get some standards and make a little bit of <unk> , or even <unk> <unk> differences ."
why am i telling you now from the audience that it is also <unk> active ?
"because the music &apos;s a language , and the language of it &apos;s an language is the <unk> ."
"an <unk> piece of art that you &apos;re never looking for , has not to work ."
"the food food that has been <unk> by or a <unk> has to be <unk> , and not just looked at <unk> or to look for recipes ."
"so listen to this , if there is a music , is going to be played ."
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> of it .
"if you can make a environment where the adult do music , or at least , to be active , a child grew up , they &apos;re very easily for a <unk> , to ask some of <unk> , what does their <unk> matter ?"
can you play me in blue now ?
"and the child is playing after an <unk> , instead of having a red blue now ."
and this sounds quite different from the time .
this was the very first time of an <unk> <unk> system .
so the first step to make a interpretation .
"and what happens when you play a piece of today , which is originally being written by 100 ago or <unk> years ago ?"
the instruments now have <unk> .
"it had <unk> as an <unk> as a instrument , not a piano ."
and it &apos;s simply not invented .
and i guess that the <unk> had been <unk> when it had the most <unk> opportunities that had <unk> in the modern <unk> .
"i can now make the <unk> that the <unk> had to have the power of modern wings for the modern <unk> , which is not <unk> <unk> ."
"and even from <unk> that you know , it was more <unk> than it was <unk> to be deaf ."
"now , in the modern orchestra , there is a modern <unk> to play all of what an orchestra has <unk> in the back of <unk> ."
and therefore these are a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> the pieces <unk> them .
"and they get <unk> , which they &apos;ve only <unk> ."
and what you &apos;re going to think about to be today in the business .
"or what else i <unk> with you today was , what they thought they were going to have ."
thank you .
do you know what your heart is ?
so were you <unk> ?
and how does that feel ?
that &apos;s the <unk> .
i have a friend that moves on a <unk> .
"if i get , with my little <unk> of <unk> <unk> and me <unk> next , this sense comes to ."
i &apos;m at a time .
"i say , <unk> , for what are you having great car ?"
that &apos;s probably lost half the <unk> <unk> of his year .
and you &apos;re not much less than me at all .
why does i have to afford little car ?
"and then it goes back to me , and it &apos;s <unk> ."
it is against justice .
"and what i say is the word fairness , is the <unk> sense ."
our organism has invented a great way of <unk> feeling like the heart of just <unk> to go .
you can also try this with words like <unk> or something .
"and i want to explain to you with that <unk> of today , or something that is probably very familiar with you ."
the <unk> comes from the <unk> .
"but remember , you don &apos;t think about the <unk> , you might have heard of people , if people say , nobody has got a wall ."
and then rocks <unk> to <unk> the point of view .
"so in some such <unk> , you can see the liars will not believe what he says ."
"and it <unk> light up to <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> to make it in your mind ."
it only <unk> you and it &apos;s <unk> .
"no , <unk> the <unk> that i have about doing so that you can <unk> yourself ."
they need those <unk> to go and get an <unk> around an open <unk> .
"they can make them less , yes , or <unk> to their own food ."
they need time .
"from this time , a <unk> you might know ."
the <unk> painter painter brown <unk> once a woman .
"the woman <unk> up , and this is what <unk> wouldn &apos;t be like you ."
"<unk> , the answer , wait only one ."
they &apos;ll always do the same more .
"and when they make this place , they laugh , you know , how important this idea is and how much time they need to know something that <unk> can tell us really well ."
and artists have a very <unk> relationship to the <unk> .
"and the artists are sharing something with them , and especially of this lady , she doesn &apos;t , if she doesn &apos;t look in the mirror and she can look at it ."
"the artists will share you in a <unk> thing with which they will be <unk> , if you look at the <unk> of this kind of piece ."
"then , the <unk> feeling , <unk> that can &apos;t see you like that , and it &apos;s always like you ."
and you have these <unk> of the <unk> that we can use the <unk> as an awesome invention to the design of our <unk> system .
"and not just in art also in art , in a <unk> , and in the mythology of the discovery , in narratives , it actually appear ."
you may see this idea by lady who looked into his mirror every morning and asked him to ask him who is the most famous in the country ?
"one day , this mirror says , yeah , there &apos;s a <unk> ."
behind the seven mountains and so on .
"and you know , also how much <unk> <unk> of it from true <unk> , even the mirror cannot lies <unk> out of this <unk> ."
but we should just <unk> us so that you cannot say that there is some <unk> somewhere .
"and here &apos;s the need for what we see in the <unk> areas , <unk> and <unk> ."
we need to have this kind of <unk> that can make it <unk> without even the fact that we can &apos;t <unk> .
"we &apos;re not only in art , in the <unk> , but we &apos;re also in the science of great <unk> ."
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s wife of <unk> <unk> .
"they heard about this book of charles darwin , who &apos;s origin the species and people ."
"that people who were <unk> by <unk> and , yes , at least , there was a common ancestry between human and monkeys ."
"and they would <unk> them to their husband , and said , it &apos;s not true , you know , the charles ."
the human man is supposed to have <unk> or an shared <unk> .
"no , no , that &apos;s not about ."
"now , when the true thing is , we need to prevent people from <unk> ."
why do we need to prevent people from getting people from things ? if it &apos;s true ?
because we cannot live in these <unk> .
"because that <unk> , that feeling , to be fantastic , from the highest creatures of <unk> to some sort of <unk> of <unk> , from such a kind of <unk> such as one that has to be a stone in terms of things and the other ."
so we can &apos;t <unk> these things .
"we need to stop that people are going to get <unk> of things , especially if they &apos;re true ."
"you see how slow down this <unk> and how it looked like the <unk> , that he &apos;s <unk> , that it &apos;s going to lead to another picture of self , i want to <unk> you one another story ."
"so a very beautiful story , i mean ."
my wife told me .
"and she came up with a day from school , she &apos;s <unk> , and she told them from a student ."
an <unk> student .
it loves him to be particularly excited because he <unk> a tendency to the <unk> .
"and she asked him , what are your <unk> ?"
"and he says , well i &apos;m on fire ."
"and because i &apos;m at <unk> fire , i &apos;m interested in the most interesting stuff ."
"yes , it &apos;s always when you &apos;re at that point , because there doesn &apos;t ."
"i have told a man , always in a moral <unk> <unk> as an <unk> <unk> , because we could try and replace <unk> it by <unk> ."
do they <unk> this one and then they get the phrase .
"although i &apos;m at the fire floor , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things ."
you &apos;re feeling that &apos;s really the real truth behind <unk> .
"so , one of the little <unk> , not to be interested in <unk> ."
it &apos;s the <unk> .
"but there &apos;s no <unk> of <unk> that we can tell you , where we &apos;re learning about how to fire ."
"there are only the <unk> <unk> , and the fire fire ."
and it <unk> .
"and you say , you don &apos;t know your <unk> too , that you like to stick <unk> somewhere and <unk> if the fire was <unk> after it ."
"no , it just does it see a lot better when we &apos;re in it that we &apos;re in there that <unk> to the <unk> , we &apos;re going to do it , by the other one , if you put fire in fire ."
here you have these little <unk> .
"these <unk> on the <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , that the fact that it had really known as a fire , but he &apos;s not able to say it ."
"here &apos;s one in these <unk> between <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> , who immediately <unk> you can do , and the things you know that you know how much they can do so much more and how much they do it for them ."
"so , it just comes to these words that we &apos;ve also been using the language of politically <unk> ."
"we actually know , something else is the case ."
"but we know that if we <unk> the process , the social <unk> are very sensitive to it ."
we can &apos;t do the right thing .
it &apos;s not that kind of things in a society that &apos;s going to work to be <unk> .
i want to show you what we &apos;ve been doing in my <unk> .
"after what logic , the <unk> , these <unk> , the willingness to move , to another one that is truly in the <unk> that it &apos;s <unk> to spread out to the outside ."
"<unk> , i want to share with you two , maybe three examples ."
"the first example of <unk> what many of them know to be , and some of you probably don &apos;t need to have very much ."
i &apos;m my soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
"the soul is so <unk> , about <unk> ."
"it &apos;s a something that has not seen from <unk> , <unk> ."
"and if you have people who are the effective belief that they &apos;re own soul , or they can say they &apos;re given to the soul to live to life , in their own way , they &apos;re not as much as much as they &apos;re about as much the disease , the body , as it is ,"
"and the idea that you &apos;re wondering in the <unk> of nature of nature , this particular <unk> , in <unk> , it is the <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> ."
"and then when this <unk> <unk> over humans , then it was filled with the mind , with nature , which is only in nature , it can be with a soul ."
and then he can just <unk> in a <unk> .
this is the idea of <unk> <unk> .
so it &apos;s about coming out of people .
so that we are supposed to be able to perceive it as one that &apos;s <unk> to be our lives .
"and then when they get those assumption of eyes , you see the logic with us to be able to be able to improve the <unk> of our world ."
because now you can use a <unk> .
"<unk> , you know , from school still ."
this is a computer <unk> here now that <unk> a logic that describes us .
and that &apos;s actually the hardest part here in my talk .
"here you need some logic , but you need to lie to <unk> ."
and it &apos;s the way to lie to <unk> this logic .
this is a <unk> in <unk> of four <unk> .
"the first phrase is , <unk> <unk> says that there &apos;s nothing a soul ."
"so the second sentence is , if <unk> has a <unk> right , then he &apos;s not a soul ."
"well now , it &apos;s a third sentence ."
i did a particularly <unk> .
a <unk> sentence that immediately <unk> people have a <unk> feeling of a soul .
"people who say , who has no soul , it &apos;s dead , can never be there ."
and here you feel it .
"and here &apos;s that logic in that <unk> , yes in the <unk> , in this <unk> talk about expression ."
and you can see it immediately .
the first two <unk> that are kind of <unk> .
i can argue everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t worry about the reality .
and i can tell the <unk> is a man .
"and if i get right , the <unk> is a guy ."
"if i am not a right , it &apos;s not a <unk> man ."
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what is .
i can say everything .
"but the key is when i do , it &apos;s true ."
"so when <unk> calls , it &apos;s not a soul ."
"two , if the right is he &apos;s right , he &apos;s got a soul ."
these things are <unk> <unk> .
and so our <unk> minds are now able to do something .
"it <unk> a third sentence , which is actually nothing to do with the first one of two <unk> and is the opposite to the first time the very first <unk> to <unk> <unk> and air ."
because we &apos;d actually have to prove whether there &apos;s soul or not .
"but with that logic , it just using it just that two <unk> can <unk> , and a third kind of <unk> that &apos;s going out there to do something like he could have to do with this so we can save our <unk> ."
"so we do , as we are , actually , not being able to live without a soul ."
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can <unk> those things from different different kinds of <unk> .
"in the present moment , we have a real modern example that goes back over the <unk> <unk> ."
"<unk> , you have to be a different issue of <unk> , a sense of philosophy , in <unk> ."
and this has a sense that we go back into the <unk> century .
"there was an <unk> , which was called <unk> <unk> and after that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> called <unk> ."
so the <unk> <unk> is an <unk> <unk> which is made from <unk> nature .
the one doesn &apos;t have the soul .
that is an <unk> .
"and then you <unk> into the middle line between two <unk> <unk> , then you <unk> it ."
because he doesn &apos;t know what <unk> he should be first .
and so it goes in the middle .
and so the <unk> <unk> is introduced .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> to each other .
it &apos;s not there .
"just when they give another example , and then , even if you take the <unk> into a <unk> , it also needs no <unk> and not anything else ."
"and basically , he goes to the right thoughts ."
"so if you &apos;ve got that idea that in nature , you &apos;re kind of being put in some of the bigger way , which is sent out of a <unk> , you get into the position you can get something like a free will ."
"and when we &apos;re in <unk> here in the <unk> , i look at the <unk> for <unk> ."
"and there &apos;s a <unk> , the wolf that goes <unk> , and then it says you &apos;re sometimes <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s nothing to say ."
"and so we can form the second sentence and we can tell if the wolf , if you &apos;re <unk> right , you don &apos;t have a car <unk> ."
"these <unk> are completely <unk> . and <unk> , <unk> ."
so what we can read almost every day in the <unk> that they find in this third sentence .
"it &apos;s something like , you can &apos;t have any <unk> , you can &apos;t have the act , and he <unk> for responsibility , and it &apos;s so <unk> ."
and you have it again .
"it &apos;s actually meant you would have to prove <unk> , that &apos;s something like <unk> <unk> ."
"but the logic allows us to do that , as a result of <unk> <unk> , if you needed the opposite evidence of no proof ."
"and now you can just do something if you want to test yourself if you want anything in yourself , if they want to , if you want to make people happy , the courage to practice the <unk> ."
"so <unk> this up , if you &apos;ll , one of the other people that you will say , there is no <unk> ."
"and please don &apos;t use the young word for <unk> , called <unk> ."
"they &apos;re not necessarily giving them , and it &apos;d be quite a little political ."
"say , no <unk> ."
"immediately , they will have one , of course , for which , for granted that you can &apos;t see ."
and you have a problem .
"because while they &apos;re busy doing that , it turns out that they cannot prove it is not that there &apos;s no <unk> , the man &apos;s happy very happy ."
"and it &apos;s very happy to think about that , because it has <unk> ."
"because it <unk> it to a <unk> , not <unk> <unk> himself at all ."
"because in fact , this man is not really interested into evidence ."
"he just interested in <unk> , <unk> itself from <unk> to <unk> that there are no <unk> ."
"so , in the kind of <unk> of the <unk> world , you see the <unk> of the human mind ."
"and then again , if you have an opportunity , to feel this sort of <unk> of sense , with other people . do they make it happy when they &apos;re not in those <unk> in a <unk> ."
thank you for your attention .
"yes , good day ."
"i &apos;ve been <unk> to ask if i could mention you , &quot; i can give you to mention that ."
"she &apos;s a <unk> here from this amazing piece , and asked me to hold up here and give me a talk ."
"i have to say , well , you &apos;ve got <unk> , and i <unk> to talk to my idea ."
but maybe i can imagine that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
"but it &apos;s , of course , all of us , very much of the ideas ."
"so i probably think these are the <unk> girls that i probably <unk> to the generation , which is the <unk> green <unk> , because i &apos;ve already <unk> <unk> to <unk> in <unk> , <unk> college , i think , i guess what it means to be called a college ."
"and then i <unk> in the <unk> <unk> years , because i wanted to make <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i didn &apos;t have it at a <unk> ."
there &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
"and then the <unk> <unk> were all <unk> at that time , which was called the <unk> ."
these hot <unk> today .
"because a good engineer , it &apos;s got a great engineer or <unk> ."
but it was kind of like <unk> <unk> from the sort of <unk> from the <unk> square meter out of the square meter that was a <unk> .
"and in berlin , there was an <unk> , <unk> ."
"i &apos;m <unk> grateful that he &apos;s <unk> it again and he &apos;s given a word <unk> , because after the cylinder , we can &apos;t even use the word because everything had was right left ."
"and yet , in the <unk> years it didn &apos;t exist ."
"and the way there was <unk> there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> where you were doing bad ."
"but it was a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s got <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and started the center of the <unk> ."
"and , you know , a lot of what was called , i &apos;m touched with it is because lots of , a lot of nice <unk> i &apos;ve had ."
"i worked in the early <unk> for <unk> , and this was <unk> ."
we were twenty people in the room .
"if you didn &apos;t have a <unk> , this was <unk> , and it &apos;s got a <unk> , i &apos;ve spent 10 years to see if i really <unk> , perhaps a great deal , because of course , <unk> his own colleague , for everyone was doing my <unk> in a little day ."
they &apos;re <unk> with <unk> .
"and that was very , very <unk> and you get into that , <unk> in that kind of period , just in a picture , where i asked a picture of a million years ago , <unk> really , which really did , in <unk> , of course , in <unk> , was , at <unk> , of <unk>"
"and then i got it up to <unk> , and then together with friends , that i got <unk> <unk> from company that was <unk> to the <unk> of one in the most important world of the world ."
"a <unk> , but we have <unk> , of course , <unk> the problem of growing <unk> , and then we &apos;ve <unk> the little group that we decided to begin to go back again and go back to what &apos;s <unk> our future and <unk> ."
and so i brought to you a project i want to introduce you now .
and the title of the <unk> was like to get to a hundred percent <unk> .
and we just started to ask with a relatively <unk> story where you could make a <unk> <unk> today .
this island that this island is <unk> on the <unk> to the <unk> .
"yeah , that &apos;s like this to give you the data ."
there &apos;s a thousand and a few thousand people .
"they have <unk> fuel growth of <unk> percent , right today ."
"and the question is , why did they not have any more ?"
this is just not <unk> .
"if it <unk> more and more <unk> to each other , that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to <unk> the system ."
that is what i &apos;m telling you is that the politicians all the politicians when you look into our <unk> system .
"and the more they say , why ?"
and we have 20 percent of germany in germany .
there can &apos;t possibly be a problem at all .
"but right is not true , we &apos;ve seen in europe at seven percent , and our net is <unk> <unk> the european grid ."
"if we had in 20 percent of europe , we have the same problems that people have on that <unk> ."
"the question was simply , the time that was <unk> , the first <unk> started out with the island just was , but they just started out ."
"as big as it could actually be a battery , so you can be a island on 20 to 40 , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , perhaps even more <unk> <unk> percent ."
"and yes , i &apos;m going to go through a more <unk> ."
the conventional system sees anywhere in the world as it is .
"by the way , about a hundred <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> electric power on the world ."
that <unk> the <unk> of a hundred <unk> <unk> because it goes fast fast .
"and the <unk> of the world that &apos;s going to be done with <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> to have <unk> ."
it goes quick .
so you &apos;re making <unk> .
and it looks at usually as a rule .
"the <unk> are always going on three of the <unk> , two , two will be waiting ."
yeah . you can see that there &apos;s a burden on the bottom there .
we &apos;re also getting very accurate data .
"and the <unk> or whatever it is , or whatever it is , is , in effect , a very <unk> system can only be able to <unk> into little quantities of what can be here in small scales ."
and we just have our goal . &quot;
"the <unk> is <unk> <unk> , and the wind <unk> up the <unk> so that they can map the greater <unk> ."
"and if you want to go from 20 , 30 percent <unk> <unk> , so energy , energy a year , not the achievement right now , they have to turn out the back side ."
that means the moment you have to make sure that the renewables can actually take place the whole grid .
so this can &apos;t only be <unk> when in any kind of the way they &apos;re being <unk> .
there &apos;s nothing yet on the world .
"that &apos;s in the small level of style , so you can also use their own <unk> to a little <unk> ."
"people are always asking me , what do you actually do in <unk> with that ?"
you can do this .
"but if you want to build out many of those <unk> and build a grid , then that will get very difficult ."
"and our goal was to come back to <unk> percent , and then still there &apos;s the rest of the , the last 30 , 20 , <unk> percent , that it will be very , very expensive and it &apos;s also not going to work ."
"this is going to be a <unk> that &apos;s going to be , the hydrogen , <unk> , power of electricity you know , or <unk> , that &apos;ll be ."
they have to come up with more <unk> and <unk> and not just <unk> <unk> .
"we just wanted to know what &apos;s going on , because it &apos;s a regular , more <unk> battery ."
how far do we get there ?
then we have a whole bunch of <unk> <unk> .
"and wind and sun , and the burden of <unk> came to a result that they <unk> towards the conventional system , that after about two <unk> takes a <unk> to about a <unk> of about a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , about <unk> cents a <unk> ."
these are the most amazing <unk> <unk> of six years ago .
"and then we say , &quot; well . &quot;"
"well , you &apos;ve got <unk> ."
"now we &apos;re cheaper to think about this , as if the oil &apos;s <unk> five percent goes up ."
and then we start <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
what would it had to have anything to be done ?
<unk> <unk> with <unk> -- i &apos;ve been looking for <unk> .
we were only five people back in the way to build a society back .
and here you see .
and the brown is the conventional system that we see the green in our system .
"so our system also has an <unk> , and that is that we &apos;re still doing 20 percent of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> and not <unk> to the other ."
"and the <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> on the island , is meant to find that we &apos;re very <unk> ."
"but we also want to support it , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the <unk> problem ."
"and so we decided to build a <unk> in berlin , so we can kind of map that we can kind of map the electric <unk> at a stage three ."
"that says , we have <unk> , we have a <unk> to find the biggest battery in the world ."
here it &apos;s .
"it <unk> out asia , <unk> in the case of japan ."
"and <unk> it is <unk> into <unk> years of <unk> , today <unk> , and then became developed , <unk> on the japanese ."
"it &apos;s very , very big , it can be , very large ."
she &apos;s got an <unk> power and can bring 20 hours for this performance and so that &apos;s how we &apos;ve <unk> the battery that we are doing .
and they set them up .
"we &apos;ve also got one of the most <unk> in the same size that it says in to actually give in the <unk> , so that this whole dynamic behavior , so in the back here , it &apos;s in the back here , and this battery goes here is the bottom , that <unk> here ."
"and what we &apos;re doing over here is a little <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the cable , so we can <unk> the <unk> in the grid , and then the <unk> ."
and there &apos;s a whole again here .
"we can <unk> <unk> <unk> for the net , as well ."
"and this is what we can see again , again , again , again , this again , <unk> <unk> , of course ."
"and what we &apos;ve been doing for a long time since <unk> was done , the <unk> process of all the way that it was <unk> everything , in a set of <unk> technology , we &apos;ve done ."
"so we &apos;re not in <unk> , but we &apos;re redefining as a company just standing between the battery and around the web and anything about it ."
"you have to communicate to the battery , you can also communicate to the grid , and this is very complicated ."
"so the beautiful issue is that , in this island , you can actually take it out today to be more likely to deal with problems that we will want to increase our levels of renewables ."
"and so this whole debate as a moment of being <unk> and <unk> , as to do , as it is to go down , we have <unk> for example , for <unk> , for example , we <unk> the wind and the sun &apos;s ."
<unk> then <unk> <unk> .
"so <unk> , <unk> everywhere ."
"we can start in the island for the time to integrate <unk> <unk> , you can have a waste of <unk> ."
"that means you know , if you &apos;re in <unk> percent , <unk> that you can &apos;t do it with <unk> ."
"you can do through n &apos; <unk> by the <unk> of your <unk> , yes , which you should be doing , the percentage <unk> <unk> , and you &apos;re never <unk> on <unk> at any <unk> ."
and this is sort of n of the message .
"so , there &apos;s lots of people who go and look at that because they can see them what they get problems ."
"so when we <unk> this kind of <unk> , you didn &apos;t just get the <unk> of that kind of mass <unk> in the network ."
"and we &apos;ve taken our <unk> <unk> , basically , we have <unk> masses of great power , and it &apos;s all the wave of place around europe , which is <unk> all over europe ."
"we look into this network , and we see <unk> as the hertz as they go through the <unk> , and if the <unk> level , we start a <unk> , then a little <unk> <unk> <unk> , then we come up with a little bit again , again ."
it &apos;s the system .
"and of course , that &apos;s an incredibly <unk> ."
"if you <unk> this up somewhere , then the <unk> takes a little while ."
the <unk> <unk> system has at least ten seconds to hold the grid stable .
and they can react to the time again .
"if you have that , you have more <unk> , you have to replace this mass , and replace them with <unk> and <unk> ."
"and we can <unk> up with this big battery , a <unk> ."
"and you can see , there &apos;s a huge amount of <unk> there ."
"and the message , we have to have to take into these <unk> <unk> mass , and when we &apos;re in , our interests , 20 percent , 20 , 30 and 20 , 30 , and so on when we want to do anything at all ."
then we have to have the <unk> capacity of the web .
and the point is just that the power system goes with to keep the frequency .
"yeah , it &apos;s a <unk> right now right , the <unk> from the <unk> , because we &apos;re not , or <unk> , because this doesn &apos;t ."
"and we just try to realize that you can <unk> the <unk> capacity that <unk> , you can also get to build buildings as well as you get a novel <unk> ."
"we &apos;re also <unk> with a lot of research , now ."
"and the purpose is that people have always come and look at our <unk> , which is , sort of our own <unk> ."
"and yes , the conversation always goes around the way that you can see a <unk> of the future ."
and a lot of discussions that i &apos;ve ever had last six years would have been kind of like this discussion that i had in the last 20 years .
"so , not , for example , is <unk> , we have <unk> all the <unk> , <unk> never ."
we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> in germany today .
that &apos;s <unk> .
"and i just go out and we have the same capacity over the next 40 years , which will have the same capacity for <unk> all over the globe ."
"just like , you can get that ."
there &apos;ll be all sorts of <unk> and arguments about them .
"and so the beautiful part is that i &apos;ve just <unk> over the last two years , that the scientists have been to be in my side ."
"we have now got over 10 million <unk> to <unk> now , and to <unk> , right now , to <unk> the <unk> net ."
the next april is done .
"so what they &apos;re also going to notice is that there &apos;s this change , and just from this <unk> to , you can get the <unk> , that hundred percent percent of power is wrong ."
"and when you have a hundred percent more <unk> , it &apos;s like a huge system ."
"and i &apos;ve always tried this in discussions that &apos;s <unk> , which are <unk> that make sense of our own very small grid , which has not done nothing to do with our own system ."
"but the question is really simple when they make <unk> from the <unk> fossil fuels that are being <unk> out to a place on the world and they &apos;re then <unk> , they &apos;re in a island , as well ."
then they use the sun and the wind there are still where they live .
"and that &apos;s a little bit of our vision of a <unk> and i &apos;m <unk> <unk> for you to be said , <unk> ."
"and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s what we &apos;re going to get , and also the <unk> , from <unk> &apos;s talk , that you can use a <unk> , right ? here we &apos;ll use a little bit together ."
"and i want to just <unk> you to , in the senses that you can be just a little crazy . you might have a vision of vision ."
"and we have to really stay quite more <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going ."
thank you .
"as steve <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of los angeles , one day went through the streets of los angeles , he heard this wonderful music ."
"she came from a <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> that played on a violin , who only had two <unk> ."
"many of you will know history , because of the <unk> <unk> article , later , a book was <unk> <unk> with robert <unk> , <unk> as an <unk> and <unk> <unk> as an <unk> , his <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , in his early career ."
"<unk> <unk> left , bin <unk> , had a <unk> and 30 years later , he was living on <unk> <unk> <unk> at los angeles in los angeles ."
"i would give you all the <unk> , reading a book or to look at the movie , not just understanding the <unk> of those two men , but also how the music helped this <unk> and the <unk> it to help them as the <unk> , as the instrument , as an instrument , she <unk> the instrument"
"and i was meeting <unk> <unk> in 2008 in 2008 , two years ago , in the central african <unk> ."
"he had just heard a <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , sitting behind the stage to imagine me ."
"and he talked to a very <unk> and <unk> sound about <unk> and <unk> <unk> and how <unk> never could get it to the baseball world , and this is all of the most complete <unk> of the <unk> &apos;s <unk> sentence at the last year &apos;s <unk> ."
"we came to speak of music , and got a couple of days later , and i had an email , in which the <unk> would be <unk> to me ."
"i have to suggest that <unk> <unk> had been the medical treatment , because he was already been <unk> with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , an <unk> that <unk> his whole whole life ."
"so , when he &apos;s a consequence of this , it &apos;s particularly <unk> for these <unk> of <unk> , so sometimes it &apos;s so bad , and at the streets of <unk> , <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> by his <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> ."
"and in fact the case of <unk> was in the case of the first one of our first <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes , and he just lost <unk> ."
he spoke about invisible or smoke and <unk> about how to <unk> someone in the sleep .
"i was scared ; i was scared , but i was afraid i could lose him that he might kill him in one of his <unk> , and that i could destroy his relation to the violin and <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and other forms of <unk> ."
so i just started playing with .
i was playing the first sentence of fifth <unk> .
"and during the age of playing , i realized that in the <unk> eyes was a <unk> change in <unk> ."
"it was like , under the influence of the influence of the invisible <unk> , a chemical reaction that became my <unk> ."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> turned into understanding , an <unk> curiosity and <unk> ."
"and as a miracle <unk> , he took the violin and started to play some <unk> of <unk> and asked me to play it , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ."
"we started talking , talking about music , from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> to <unk> ."
"and i was realized that it had not only a <unk> knowledge of music , but with his own , he <unk> a different relationship with her ."
he talked about her with a passion and understanding that i only knew i &apos;ve ever seen from my colleague in the <unk> of the los angeles .
"by playing music and spoke about music , it was <unk> by this <unk> , <unk> man <unk> on los angeles , an <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
music is <unk> . music is happening .
"in terms , <unk> is a health health ."
because the music enables him to <unk> his thoughts and <unk> with his imagination and creativity through something <unk> .
and so he <unk> the <unk> in his <unk> . &quot;
i understand exactly that this is the nature of art .
"and that is why we do music in the world , so that we make something that <unk> down in all the ways inside of us , our feelings through our artistic lens , <unk> by the creativity that we can shape up with really ."
"and the place that <unk> all reached us , and moves slowly and <unk> us ."
"the <unk> of <unk> , so that &apos;s how she brought it back to the music into a community of friends ."
"the <unk> force of music brought him back to the family of <unk> that realized his mind , the talent <unk> and <unk> him ."
"and i will again , again with <unk> music , whether <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> in <unk> <unk> row , because he reminds me of why i was a musician ."
thank you very much .
<unk> <unk> : thank you very much .
robert robert .
robert prize : i want a <unk> i have a <unk> <unk> .
i hope you forgive me .
so i have a lot of <unk> in my life .
so i have two <unk> .
"this is a first , which was more like a passionate <unk> ."
"it was an amazing fish -- <unk> , good <unk> <unk> , a <unk> on the map ."
what a fish .
"so better , he was <unk> for the highest standards in <unk> of sustainability ."
you may feel like to sell him to sell .
"i had a relationship , i had over several months ."
"one day , the <unk> of the company called and i asked to give a meeting about sustainability <unk> ."
"&quot; of course , i said ."
"and then here was a company trying to <unk> what that kind of <unk> problem has become our leaders , how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?"
"the only 50 years , we have <unk> the ocean that we were <unk> <unk> forests ."
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
"90 percent of the big fish that we like , the <unk> , the <unk> , the bad , the <unk> , the <unk> , they &apos;ve been killed ."
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
"so the point is that they get to <unk> or bad , part , <unk> , are part of the future ."
"many arguments about that are <unk> , <unk> the environment , most of you , and you &apos;re very inefficient , we &apos;re taking tuna . big ."
he &apos;s got an <unk> <unk> from about 15 .
"this is , 15 pounds of pounds <unk> are going to be going by <unk> a pound ."
not sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
so there &apos;s finally a company trying to make it right .
i wanted them to <unk> .
"the day before that event , i call the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ."
so we &apos;re calling him this <unk> .
"<unk> : &quot; i said , &quot; only to have the facts really are right , you &apos;re famous to the ocean so far out of the sea in the environment , it was not <unk> . &quot;"
"and that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we are so far out that it &apos;s going to be <unk> out of our fish , it &apos;s not concentrated . &quot;"
"and then he put it on , we &apos;re basically a world ."
this <unk> from <unk> to one . he said .
&quot; the best in the business . &quot;
"to try to say , great ."
&quot; <unk> one of one ? what do you want ? &quot;
"&quot; sustainable protein , &quot; he said ."
"&quot; great , &quot; i said . i <unk> ."
"and i sat down in the bed , and i thought , what is a <unk> protein ?"
"so the next day i called to briefly , just before the event , <unk> ."
"i said , &quot; <unk> , what &apos;s sustainable proteins . &quot;"
he said he didn &apos;t do it -- he won &apos;t . he &apos;ll <unk> that .
"and i <unk> with some people in the company -- none could give me a <unk> to the answer , until finally , finally , to the <unk> , i <unk> ."
we also call him him <unk> .
"&quot; <unk> &quot; i said , &quot; what about sustainable proteins are <unk> ? &quot;"
"well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> ."
"i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;"
"he said , &quot; yeah , <unk> , skin <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> . &quot;"
"i said , &quot; what &apos;s the <unk> of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;"
in <unk> of maybe two percent .
"so , &quot; well , they &apos;re about 30 percent , &quot; he said ."
"i said , &quot; <unk> what &apos;s sustainable to get chicken to the fish ? &quot;"
"there was a long <unk> <unk> in the line , and he said , &quot; well there was very much chicken on earth . &quot;"
i &apos;m <unk> from that fish .
"no , i &apos;m just a <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> ."
that &apos;s even me .
"no , i was actually getting <unk> from this fish because , i &apos;m talking , with god , that made fish for the chicken after this conversation ."
"that second fish , this is a different way of <unk> ."
"it &apos;s the most <unk> , the kind of , in which you know , the more they &apos;re learning their fish , that you &apos;re <unk> the fish ."
i first <unk> him at a restaurant <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> had spoken for a long time .
she <unk> us <unk> .
"and he came across the table with a video of <unk> , almost <unk> <unk> color ."
the <unk> had put him .
just twice .
he had always <unk> <unk> .
who can make you make a fish good taste for <unk> .
i can &apos;t . but this guy can .
we call it <unk> . in fact it &apos;s called <unk> .
"and no , he didn &apos;t have the fish , and he &apos;s a <unk> , at least in the kind of <unk> you and you understand that ."
he &apos;s a <unk> at <unk> . &quot; he &apos;s <unk> .
this is an <unk> at the bottom line .
she &apos;s close to the <unk> river .
"until in the late 1980s , the <unk> was in the hands of <unk> ."
they were <unk> <unk> at which they &apos;re just <unk> .
and they did the country by putting the country .
"they <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> out water out of the country and out into the river ."
"well they couldn &apos;t do that , that <unk> , not economic , for the economically ."
"and <unk> , it was a disaster ."
it got about 90 percent of those birds to do a lot of birds .
"and so <unk> a <unk> company , with <unk> <unk> , he &apos;s bought her land ."
what did they do ?
you have <unk> the river .
they literally have the <unk> <unk> .
instead of <unk> this water they used to use <unk> to bring the water back back .
they <unk> the <unk> .
"they <unk> a thousand <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and his company <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> completely <unk> ."
the <unk> is incredible .
"i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like that ."
"they &apos;re <unk> at the horizon , that &apos;s a million miles away , and all they &apos;re all about are <unk> <unk> and that density , <unk> march ."
"now , i wasn &apos;t a very long time at <unk> ."
"he &apos;s an incredible guy , and three pieces , charles darwin and part &quot; a <unk> to the concert . &quot;"
"alright ? we were and we were <unk> by the <unk> , and i was <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> to my <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , a <unk> ."
and here it <unk> a rare <unk> that it .
now he mentioned the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
"and here , it sees a pattern of <unk> that reminds him in a <unk> colony ."
it turns out that <unk> have spent most of its career career in <unk> in sub-saharan africa .
i asked him as he became a <unk> .
"and he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish ."
i &apos;m an <unk> expert . &quot;
"and then it goes , and then <unk> over over more of rare <unk> and algae , including <unk> ."
"and don &apos;t understand me at a point , which was really <unk> , you know , the <unk> society <unk> , as the kind of ."
"it &apos;s amazing , but i fell in love ."
and my head was weak on that <unk> of <unk> <unk> i <unk> on .
"so i <unk> it . i said , &quot; <unk> , how did you eat your fish as much ? &quot;"
he showed him on the algae .
"&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the <unk> , the algae , the relationships that is incredibly ."
but what do they do the <unk> ?
what &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> ? &quot;
"now , he goes to me to tell me that it &apos;s so a really good system that the food , the fish that would eat in the wild ."
"the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , that &apos;s what the fish were doing ."
"so , the system , it &apos;s so healthy , it &apos;s all <unk> ."
there &apos;s no food .
the ones of one &apos;s <unk> are all about that animals that don &apos;t <unk> in them ?
"and then a day i drove around this project , and i said , &quot; well , for me , for a place which seems to be like , &quot; unlike any <unk> that i &apos;ve been in , &quot; what do you know ? &quot;"
and so the moment of being there was an <unk> <unk> to have a <unk> .
"and we <unk> around the corner and we had a <unk> <unk> and thousands of <unk> of <unk> <unk> , literally a <unk> of a light that is so long ."
"&quot; well , that &apos;s success . he said ."
"&quot; look at your <unk> , pink ."
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was <unk> confused .
"i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you <unk> your fish ? &quot;"
"&quot; <unk> , &quot; he said ."
&quot; we &apos;re going to lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> of birds .
"now , last month , they were 600,000 birds in this area that had about 250 different species ."
it &apos;s the biggest one now and one of the most important private <unk> in the entire country today .
"i said , &quot; <unk> <unk> , is this very <unk> <unk> that we want to have on a computer seat . &quot;"
"he kept his mind , no ."
"he said : &quot; we built <unk> , we didn &apos;t <unk> ."
and this is an <unk> network .
they &apos;re eating <unk> food .
the food food is eating food .
"so the <unk> , the heat the better the system . &quot;"
"okay , let &apos;s think about that . a <unk> that <unk> their animals are not related to <unk> and <unk> their success to be <unk> ."
"you know , a <unk> , but a <unk> ."
"oh , by the way , and in the way , these <unk> are not even there at all ."
"she <unk> <unk> in a city of <unk> kilometers , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> ."
"every morning , they fly <unk> miles into <unk> ."
and she <unk> them up kilometers a hundred and every night .
"you do this because you can follow the white line , the <unk> line ."
it &apos;s seriously .
"i was <unk> to me from a way of those penguins , so i was looking at my <unk> ."
"i said , &quot; <unk> , fly <unk> miles to the <unk> , and fly them back to night after that night <unk> ?"
do you do this for your children ? &quot;
and he looked at me as if i had just <unk> a song from sunset .
"he said , &quot; no . you know , because the food is better . &quot;"
"i don &apos;t have the skin &apos;s <unk> of my own fish saying that was <unk> , the <unk> , and i don &apos;t <unk> them , i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like them , i don &apos;t want them to be <unk> ."
"it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
i almost never <unk> with this .
"and yet , as i <unk> you in that restaurant , in <unk> , they didn &apos;t have to look for <unk> at all ."
they <unk> <unk> cute and <unk> like if you were to take a water <unk> from the ocean .
i mentioned the <unk> and he <unk> .
he said to &quot; the skin <unk> like a <unk> .
it &apos;s the last <unk> before some in the body .
it &apos;s evolved throughout the evolution to get <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and it added a thing . &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have the water .
"okay . <unk> the fish that don &apos;t feed out of their fish , a <unk> that <unk> the success of success ."
"and then , i realized that if he <unk> , he &apos;s got a <unk> he &apos;s not <unk> , he <unk> , because the water coming through that <unk> <unk> from the river ."
"it &apos;s a river that causes all the stuff that &apos;s <unk> from rivers these rivers today to <unk> them with chemical pollutants , <unk> of <unk> <unk> ."
and when it <unk> into the system and this <unk> is the water <unk> than it &apos;s <unk> .
"the system is so healthy , it <unk> the water ."
"so , not only one <unk> <unk> that didn &apos;t take their animals , not only one for them <unk> in the quality of their <unk> , but it &apos;s a light that is literally <unk> , and not only for you , but for me ."
"because when the water comes down , it was in the atlantic ."
"one fall in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and you should do , because , as you know , this sort of as romantic as well , as , <unk> ."
"so you can say they &apos;re a recipe for good <unk> , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> ."
"what we need now is this radical concept from agriculture from a <unk> , in fact , <unk> ."
"but for many people , that &apos;s kind of a radical ."
we &apos;re not <unk> ; we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re <unk> .
you love <unk> . we love the little <unk> ; we talk about <unk> food . we eat .
"and if they say that they &apos;re the things that are good to make good <unk> in the future , somebody &apos;s out there and say , &quot; hey , guys , i love with love <unk> , but how are you &apos;re going to feed the world ?"
how do they feed the world ? &quot;
can i go honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
"no , because we have enough calories to produce enough calories about the world more than only to feed ."
a billion people will have <unk> today .
"one billion -- this is more than ever earlier than any before -- because of <unk> <unk> in the distribution , not the <unk> ."
"well , i don &apos;t ask this question because they &apos;ve <unk> the logic of our 50 years on our <unk> last 50 years ."
"corn <unk> <unk> on <unk> , <unk> chemicals , <unk> with the earth , chicken , <unk> over <unk> , and the whole time just asked the <unk> to say , &quot; when do we feed more people , how much could be that ? &quot;"
this was the <unk> . it was the <unk> ; it was the <unk> of american agriculture .
"we should call you what she is that an <unk> in <unk> , an <unk> , which <unk> quickly <unk> , which enables that to put that into production ."
"now , that &apos;s not an <unk> , and it &apos;s not agriculture ."
"our <unk> is today threatened , not among <unk> , but by <unk> resources ."
"not through the <unk> and <unk> , but through <unk> land , not by pumps , but through <unk> water , not from <unk> , but by forests , but by forests , and through <unk> , <unk> , it <unk> , through the sea ."
and you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s begin to start with the question : how do we feed ourselves ?
"or better , how can we do conditions that allow every community to feed itself ?"
to do that -- don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future .
"it &apos;s really old , and it is done ."
"capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> and it never produced a very good for food ."
but let &apos;s look at the <unk> model .
this is where we can do this on a half billion years of <unk> .
"look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> ."
"businesses , which are not worlds for us , businesses , <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , rather than <unk> , farmers <unk> , are <unk> not only <unk> , but in our relations , of experts ."
because they &apos;re the people who are also the taste for taste .
"and when i am actually honest , it &apos;s a better chance to be more <unk> than i &apos;ll ever be ."
"you know that &apos;s quite what i &apos;m right , because when the future gets to a happy , it &apos;s going to be <unk> ."
thank you .
"if i want to <unk> a thing to give you a point , which is that the data we consume is much larger than the <unk> of the parts , and instead of the parts of <unk> of the data , i &apos;d become so far as we can as it as it is , as <unk> it can"
"so , what we see here is an incredibly <unk> <unk> to age ."
the program i used to do here is just a little experiment .
"it &apos;s called <unk> and what i could do with <unk> is that , for one given cause of death , i say , <unk> accidents ."
and i &apos;m seeing another pattern that makes it so .
"and that &apos;s because , in the <unk> here , people are the people who are in <unk> and they &apos;ve come over here right over here ."
"we can move out and go and look at the data and then we have the data and see that <unk> and <unk> are <unk> that the most <unk> are , but not for any of everyone ."
"now , when we go and go beyond age , we &apos;re going to see 40 years or younger , we even see that <unk> <unk> is the main cause to be concerned about the people ."
"and who <unk> sees that this is true to men , that &apos;s true in men ."
"so , you can see that this looks from information and data in this way to <unk> in an living field ."
"and if we can do this for <unk> , why can &apos;t there for content itself ?"
so the thing that we now here are that the <unk> every single <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s everything . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it by your <unk> talk .
"with <unk> , they &apos;re going to get <unk> into a decade ."
you can <unk> into a year &apos;s <unk> .
and you &apos;re able to jump directly into a <unk> .
"now , if i look down here , i look at the <unk> that appear in this copy , and the <unk> ."
"i am an american armstrong , and i &apos;m saying , so , i &apos;ll have been told for the <unk> armstrong to tell me about what <unk> armstrong is going on ."
"now , if i just wanted to take a <unk> show , i could do , &quot; ok , what if i <unk> with the subject of a <unk> ? &quot;"
so i &apos;m going to take back and look and look at the perspective .
"and now , look at <unk> <unk> ."
"and so you get a idea of this , that if you &apos;re going into this kind of information , you &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , you &apos;re not just looking for it , you don &apos;t just want to do any <unk> or a <unk> ."
you do something that &apos;s really a bit different .
it &apos;s something in between and we think it &apos;s changing the way we can use information .
"i want to just give this idea a bit further on , something that &apos;s a little crazy ."
"so what we &apos;ve done here is we <unk> each single <unk> , and <unk> them to a little bits ."
"so the <unk> just puts a short <unk> , and a symbol for the area it comes in ."
i &apos;ll just take the top 500 of the food <unk> .
"but even in that <unk> view , we can do a lot of things ."
we immediately get an impression about the issues that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m now to vote out the <unk> .
"now , after i <unk> government , i have learned that the <unk> that most <unk> have <unk> &quot; people of this <unk> . &quot;"
this is actually important because that &apos;s an idea that &apos;s not within one of one individual <unk> .
and that &apos;s only <unk> if you look at a stage and you look at all .
"in addition to a certain particular <unk> , i can then go to the subject of the <unk> <unk> , &quot; humans will go into this year &apos;s year ."
"now if i look at all these people in the world , i know that the majority are <unk> . some of the ones get from science . some less , the value of the economy . here is my <unk> and from the car <unk> ."
"and interestingly , it &apos;s also a <unk> <unk> ."
"so we can <unk> down , and we see all the ted <unk> up ."
"you see that we see <unk> on the net , as if it &apos;s really <unk> , not just by side , but a lot of more abstract ."
and so i want to show you what else could be a little surprise .
i just &apos;ll only show you the new york square times .
"<unk> : that app -- i &apos;m not going to call it a molecule ; this is not a browser , but you can look at web instructions , and we can take this <unk> to everybody else &apos;s size like that ."
"and so , i can go back to a step , and i can <unk> it directly to a specific <unk> ."
"that &apos;s why , because it &apos;s important for just to take you from websites in this sort of , and in a <unk> , you can look at all the same way ."
i can put my <unk> into a certain <unk> .
there was the whole demonstration that i &apos;d <unk> up there .
and i can sort of <unk> anything that i &apos;ve seen before .
"and if i look at the step again and look at everything , i can <unk> my process to maybe go back to my <unk> , i went to <unk> , here , for <unk> , or for here , <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
and here i can turn the side and get them to go back and forth .
"it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used to <unk> over time , and every time it &apos;s going to get the <unk> bigger than the sum of the <unk> ."
"right now , in this world , we can think that data is an <unk> ."
so we go through the lens of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about the &quot; <unk> &quot; information .
"what if we could take that situation and put the internet on the heads so instead of going to continue from being one to another , many of the amount of things to go to many of these things , and that causes the <unk> behind , which would be otherwise they were <unk> behind them ."
"in case we can do this , it &apos;ll add these <unk> <unk> , maybe a new source of information ."
"and instead of being just in information , we can get able to know this ."
"and if we know , we can also be <unk> from the <unk> of it ."
"so i hear this , thanks to the end ."
i grew up with a <unk> <unk> portion .
i was going to go into school with the bus for school every day a hour .
"and my nose always sat in a book , an <unk> , that my thoughts <unk> and forth in other worlds , in my way , <unk> , in a sense , <unk> curiosity ."
"and this <unk> also showed that i was always when i was <unk> with school , traveling out the forests , <unk> , and i went from <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> it at the scene of a microscope ."
"i was absolutely <unk> , you know ."
there was always about trying to understand the world and to understand the limits of the possible .
"and my love to <unk> <unk> looked at into my environment because at the time , at the late 60s , went to the moon and the <unk> ."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> came out with a living room with the <unk> that <unk> animals and places , and a world of wonder we can never have seen before ."
it &apos;s got very well at that <unk> .
and i was a artists .
i could do . i could paint .
"and there &apos;s no video , neither <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> that had been <unk> all over the <unk> in the media lab , and i had to create the pictures in my head ."
"so we had this one that we all had , and when we read the children a book , we took the description of the <unk> and <unk> them in our heads ."
"the point on this is to draw and paint from alien , alien <unk> worlds , more research , <unk> and everything ."
"in the <unk> i &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> all the time , as i &apos;m hiding , <unk> <unk> ."
the creativity had to be out .
"and what was happening , and what was really <unk> was <unk> by <unk> , that the idea was a <unk> to us in the world ourselves ."
i certainly will have a <unk> world with a <unk> . it seemed quite unlikely to me .
"but here was a world that i was able to do , in fact , in the earth , here i was just <unk> and <unk> , like all of what i &apos;ve been given to me , when i was reading the books ."
so i decided that i was 15 to become a <unk> .
"the only one problem was that in a small village , in canada , was in <unk> , we lived <unk> miles ."
i didn &apos;t <unk> .
"i had my father , until finally , he was a <unk> in <unk> , new york , <unk> , made <unk> , just on the other side , where we had lived ."
"i made the <unk> in a pool of the pool in the winter in <unk> , new york ."
"but the ocean , i have a real ocean , i just got to face two years later when we moved to california ."
"since then , over 40 years , <unk> have been <unk> , i &apos;ve spent about 10,000 hours under water , 500 hours to do ."
"and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the <unk> , even in the western oceans in the <unk> <unk> , is so rich to <unk> as we can actually possibly imagine ."
"the nature of nature doesn &apos;t know boundaries , unlike what we have , to be <unk> , in our own , human imagination ."
"so to this day , i <unk> awe at <unk> <unk> what i see on my <unk> ."
"and my love <unk> of ocean is <unk> with the same intensity of <unk> , as the bottom and the other ."
"and when i &apos;m a <unk> , it was a <unk> <unk> ."
"that seemed to be the best possibility that <unk> my <unk> to try and share stories with my need , to bring pictures ."
"i <unk> <unk> as a child , so i started out ."
"so movies were the way to make pictures , images <unk> and stories , which fit together ."
"of course , the tales i was being <unk> , from the <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; the &quot; <unk> . &quot;"
"in the <unk> , i got my <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> with the <unk> ."
"so , actually my two <unk> , <unk> up ."
"and that was something interesting that happened to do with <unk> , and to solve a very important problem -- and this is what we needed to build kind of like this <unk> <unk> -- we <unk> on some <unk> , <unk> , back ."
"so that came out of the same thing , the first <unk> <unk> to be in the film ."
"that film didn &apos;t have money to do exactly when he said , in fact , he just <unk> his <unk> , but i figured out there was something <unk> : the audience was <unk> from how <unk> it ."
"according to <unk> <unk> , the law is <unk> <unk> and <unk> not <unk> anymore from other to each other ."
so you saw something <unk> .
and that was a <unk> thing to me .
"and i thought , &quot; wow , this is really what you have in <unk> . &quot;"
"so , you know , <unk> , we got in the <unk> , and then my next movie , and a lot of the same way ."
"together with <unk> , we created this guy &apos;s <unk> metal . and it was very clearly coming out of the way that the effect would be ."
"and it worked . and once again , we had created a little bit of <unk> , and the impact was the same in the audience , we have a little bit more of money ."
"from both experiences , a new world was <unk> , and it &apos;s been able to <unk> , a new world of creativity ."
"so , i started with a company , working together with my good friend <unk> who was the best in <unk> time and was in the <unk> <unk> , which was called <unk> ."
the <unk> of that company was that the <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> to <unk> and to start with digital <unk> .
"and we did that , and then we <unk> the <unk> for a while ."
"but in the middle of &apos; 90s , we realized that we <unk> out in the &apos; 60s , and we had <unk> to the company -- we actually did the company <unk> ."
"i wrote this piece called &quot; normal , which should <unk> the <unk> in things like <unk> and effects on new effects , in addition to a new way , <unk> <unk> human <unk> , <unk> <unk> that were made by <unk> , <unk> ."
"but the <unk> <unk> were coming all back , and people in my company said that , we weren &apos;t still able to be able to create ."
"so i made this and did this other film over the great <unk> , which <unk> ."
"i <unk> this as &quot; juliet and juliet &quot; after this boat , which was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> movie ."
"<unk> , but i really wanted to <unk> the real <unk> <unk> of <unk> ."
so i made the film .
this is the truth . it didn &apos;t know .
"i <unk> her and <unk> she by saying , &quot; we &apos;re <unk> to the <unk> . we &apos;re really looking for the actual <unk> ."
so we &apos;ll see it in the <unk> of <unk> .
that &apos;s <unk> important . it &apos;s a great <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i <unk> you to fund an expedition .
"sounds crazy . and what this does it comes back to you , you can get your imagination to do reality ."
"so what we &apos;re doing is that actually , you &apos;re <unk> a <unk> <unk> that i &apos;m going to <unk> in a russian <unk> <unk> , <unk> a couple of kilometer of the surface of the surface , and i &apos;m looking at this <unk> through a <unk> ."
"this was not a film , not a <unk> , which was real ."
"so , that really <unk> my head to me ."
"and the <unk> of that was huge . we had to build cameras , and we had to build everything ."
"and i realized , as very <unk> were the one thing that was <unk> <unk> ."
"well , they were also <unk> and <unk> planning ."
"you <unk> into that space , and then you <unk> into that dark , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , where not a hope to save it , when you can &apos;t make it back ."
"and i thought , &quot; wow , that is the same , just like i was in a <unk> ."
that is really cool . &quot;
and i &apos;ve been <unk> obsessed with studying <unk> .
"anyway , from the part , working with curiosity and science has been doing . it was all for me , it was a curiosity . it was imagination ."
and it was a kind of experience that could not give me hollywood .
"because , you know , i was an beings to think of which , to design a visual effect , but i was not to imagine what i could see in the face of the sky ."
"so , for some of the next <unk> i &apos;ve seen nature <unk> , and sometimes things i &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that ever had even seen before -- and the science we didn &apos;t see them even though it was the words that we did before ."
"so that &apos;s what i was right now , and i wanted to get back ."
and so i came to have a kind of unusual decision . right ?
"in the <unk> of <unk> , i told me . &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> to a <unk> in ice , and i &apos;ll give you some <unk> . &quot;"
"and then we started to look at the <unk> , &quot; <unk> it up with <unk> ."
so that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
we had little robots that we were built to have a <unk> machine .
"our purpose was to look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> from <unk> , which never had been done before ."
"no one ever would ever <unk> the inner <unk> . they did not have any means for it , so we developed technology ."
"so here , i &apos;m sitting now , the <unk> . <unk> , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> the <unk> are very similar and <unk> , from which i know is that a band has played there ."
and i &apos;m flying on a little <unk> by the <unk> .
"i &apos;m just worried , but i think the conscious mind is within the middle ."
"it felt like that , as i was physically <unk> within the <unk> of <unk> ."
"this was an <unk> shape that i &apos;ve ever <unk> before and around a single corner before i was spending an corner , i knew what was going on in the <unk> &apos;s head , i was a while <unk> <unk> when we had <unk> in a movie ."
that &apos;s because the set of a piece of <unk> of <unk> .
so this was a very odd experience .
and she made me realize that you use to use so much <unk> and take your mind into the vehicle that can be on the vehicle as different <unk> .
it was really <unk> <unk> .
"and maybe there &apos;s a small <unk> to something which could happen in many more than you know if you had <unk> or other kinds of things to do , in all sorts of different ways that i could imagine as a <unk> picture ."
"we started looking at what we &apos;ve watched in the bottom there , really much to <unk> these <unk> , for example , where we see these incredibly <unk> animals , that &apos;s just sort of alien , right here , and here are in the <unk> ."
they &apos;re <unk> with <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in the sunlight that &apos;s in the system as we do .
"and so the animals , which is <unk> directly from a 500 degrees of <unk> , they can survive there ."
"in the same time , i was also working for <unk> that was again the <unk> from my childhood ."
"and so i ended up with the people who have interested in the <unk> and the one with the construction have and in the middle of the <unk> , are going to <unk> <unk> in russia , taking a <unk> , taking up and <unk> , and then , <unk> , <unk> international , and then , and then"
so that was <unk> .
"but the end was going out , i went out to <unk> to give us a <unk> in the <unk> ."
"and i took them to the world from <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , people who worked in such extreme terms of <unk> , and i went to the sources of data with these devices , to take <unk> and <unk> and <unk> as well ."
"we did <unk> , but they actually <unk> science , in a very way of <unk> <unk> ."
"so the circle of space was <unk> between my existence as a professional , and the <unk> is into reality ."
and i learned a lot of things in the process .
"i learned a lot of science , but i &apos;m going to think now you have to have a director who must lead to a leader , like a <unk> or something like a <unk> ."
i don &apos;t get a lot of <unk> before i get these <unk> .
"because i had to tell you about , &quot; i really do this ?"
"why do i do that ? well , what is that coming up ? &quot;"
those <unk> movies are no time to give us money .
"we are just playing the <unk> <unk> . of <unk> , we don &apos;t <unk> ."
all think i &apos;m between &quot; the <unk> &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; <unk> &quot; and i would have <unk> some of the air on the beach in a <unk> .
"i have all these films made , this <unk> , for a very small audience ."
"no <unk> , not honor to honor no money . what are you doing just ?"
"you &apos;re doing the task , by the challenge , to the oceans -- and the ocean , that &apos;s the <unk> environment that you &apos;re doing , and because you &apos;re making it because of the <unk> connection , which comes to a little group of the team ."
"because we &apos;ve done these for just 10 to 12 people <unk> <unk> <unk> for years , sometimes we &apos;re two to three months from lake and after a time ."
"and so in this community , you realize that the most important thing you &apos;re going to do , because you &apos;ve had a task , because you &apos;ve got a task that doesn &apos;t tell any other other thing ."
"you go back to land and you go back , &quot; we had to do this , the <unk> , the whole thing , the technology , the difficulty of , the human <unk> , if you don &apos;t work to the lake , &quot; you can &apos;t tell you , &quot;"
there &apos;s a connection that &apos;s an <unk> respect .
"so as i <unk> to turn my next film &quot; to &quot; normal &quot; i was trying to make the same <unk> , which is that you &apos;re <unk> , and in the <unk> of the respect of respect , it deserves , respect ."
that &apos;s where the dynamic is going to change .
"so , here &apos;s where i sat with a little team around the <unk> terrain -- we went to the avatar with a new technology , which is not yet before ."
very exciting .
a <unk> challenge .
"and we got into a very , for a half years of the time to a right family ."
"so it <unk> the way of doing my species , to make ."
there were people who were saying that we could actually <unk> these <unk> and put on the planet .
"and for me , i was more a kind of <unk> way to do my work , the actual process that changed has changed ."
so what can we do from those rooms ?
what lessons do we have learned ?
"i think , to the first one , it is curiosity ."
it &apos;s the <unk> human capacity .
we have a force to be a force that can actually create reality .
and the <unk> your house is more important than all of the world .
"to me , boy <unk> come from , saying , &quot; give me a piece of advice that i can make . &quot;"
"and i say , &quot; don &apos;t you even have a <unk> . &quot;"
"some people get that . don &apos;t make yourself . don &apos;t do yourself , don &apos;t yourself versus yourself , but take risks for you . &quot;"
the nasa has so much a <unk> -- &quot; <unk> is not alternative . &quot;
"but in art and in the process , we need to be an alternative , and there is an <unk> <unk> , because it <unk> ."
not a very important thing to <unk> innovation is that it ever happened without risk .
you have to be ready to take those risks .
"this is the idea i &apos;d like to share with you all , which is a alternative , but <unk> &apos;s not an alternative , but thank you . thank you ."
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate change .
"and maybe this surprised something , because my work <unk> in the foundation , mainly about <unk> and <unk> around <unk> to create those things we &apos;ve got <unk> up and give to life a better number of the world ."
"but energy , and the climate and climate are extremely important to these people , even more than any other one on the planet ."
"<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to grow over many years . it &apos;s too much or too much <unk> , and the things are going to do as <unk> , can &apos;t change the environment ."
"that leads to <unk> . it has a <unk> of uncertainty , it leads to <unk> ."
"so , a <unk> <unk> of them will be <unk> ."
the <unk> of the <unk> for you is also important .
"the fact is that , if they could just <unk> the price of the price for a <unk> energy , the cost of <unk> was far ."
"now , the <unk> is <unk> over time ."
"in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> ."
"so the <unk> <unk> industrial revolution on and in the 20th century had a <unk> case in <unk> and therefore we &apos;ve created <unk> , we can produce modern materials , and so many other things ."
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
"but if we <unk> the price , we &apos;ll put in about the price , we meet a new barrier and that <unk> to co2 ."
co2 <unk> the planet and the equation is actually a pretty obvious .
"they <unk> co2 to the <unk> , which leads to the <unk> and <unk> have some very negative effects . effects on the weather and <unk> , that <unk> , the natural ecosystems can &apos;t <unk> so much <unk> and all the systems of the world ."
"well , the <unk> correlation between a <unk> and the <unk> act by <unk> and where your other effects are , there are a few people , but not very much ."
"and there &apos;s certain <unk> about how bad that will be . but they &apos;re being extremely bad , ok ."
"i asked <unk> the <unk> <unk> , &quot; we really need to go back to zero ?"
<unk> no <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
"the answer is : to come near zero , is going to move temperature ."
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
and it &apos;s quite different than we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> foot from one inch <unk> . you can sort of <unk> it out in front .
"this has to be <unk> , zero ."
"now , we <unk> a lot <unk> from 26 billion tons of it , every year ."
"everyone was about 20 tons . people of poor countries , less than one ."
"on average , it &apos;s about five tons of <unk> on earth ."
"and somehow , we need to produce change changes that <unk> down to zero ."
so it &apos;s all the time up .
"it was only <unk> <unk> of economic changes in itself , and we must have to get <unk> rise to <unk> <unk> and to a <unk> <unk> to zero ."
"that equation has four factors . a little bit of energy . they have the one thing on the left -- that will bring it towards zero , and that becomes more than the number of people , <unk> by the average of every single person on its own ."
so let &apos;s look at every factor of <unk> and see how we get to a zero .
and probably one of those numbers needs to get very close to far .
"well , that &apos;s a basic <unk> , but we &apos;ll leave it through ."
we first have people <unk> .
"today , <unk> billion people ."
and it <unk> at nine billion of the world &apos;s <unk> moving on nine billion .
"so if we were successful with new <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , we could probably get that to 10 percent down to 15 percent , but when we see a <unk> <unk> ."
the second factor is for all of the services we use .
"it <unk> everything that food that we eat -- clothes , tv , television -- <unk> ."
these are very good things and <unk> means they have to do this service nearly anywhere on the planet .
and it &apos;s great that this <unk> .
"in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could probably use solar <unk> and fewer , but the average will rise in every year , in <unk> , and <unk> the number of the services of the economy are <unk> ."
here we see a very <unk> service . does it take home to do the homework ?
"and those students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their friends under the <unk> ."
"now , for efficiency , the capacity , the energy per service , there are now good news ."
and we have something that doesn &apos;t grow .
"and because of the different <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , through various ways to make up the <unk> , many ways that have been able to provide some of the service , some individual service will reduce the number of 90 percent ."
"in other ways , how to create <unk> , 98 , <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> : <unk> , or <unk> , is the <unk> , is much more improvement for improvements ."
"so <unk> , if we &apos;re optimistic , we &apos;re going to get <unk> to be two or perhaps by a factor of six ."
"but for the first three factors , we have now gone from 26 billion to 50 trillion tons , and it &apos;s just not enough to be !"
so let &apos;s see that fourth factor -- and this one will be <unk> -- that &apos;s the number of carbon that is going to become a <unk> of <unk> .
and it thinks the question you can get zero .
"when it burn the coal , no ."
and when they burn natural gas .
"every <unk> for the power in energy , we &apos;re using co2 from cutting , <unk> and <unk> <unk> ."
"so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system ."
we need <unk> .
"now , if i use the &quot; wonder &quot; , i don &apos;t know the impossible ."
the <unk> is a wonder : the <unk> is a miracle .
"the internet and service , for its service ."
people here have created a <unk> of many of these <unk> .
it is often no <unk> to take an <unk> until you take a particular <unk> .
"you normally usually get to it , and some people don &apos;t come , you don &apos;t ."
but in that case we need to give <unk> and a <unk> in very short time .
"well , i wondered how do i really <unk> this ?"
"do it &apos;s an natural <unk> , an example , a <unk> to people &apos;s idea of that ?"
i remembered myself last year when i brought mosquitos and sort of <unk> like people .
"and the idea of it was really <unk> to you , you know , there &apos;s people living with mosquitos ."
"for energy , it <unk> me here ."
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies would be the <unk> of fireflies to be here .
so here are a bunch of natural fireflies .
and i <unk> you don &apos;t bite . you don &apos;t get to the glass .
"well , there &apos;s all kinds of kinds of things like this . but they &apos;re all not making much ."
"we need solutions , either or multiple <unk> who have <unk> and <unk> <unk> , so far , and there &apos;s many directions in which people look for looking for , i actually see five of them that very big <unk> ."
"i <unk> <unk> , <unk> , fusion . <unk> &apos;s ."
"and perhaps they do something <unk> and i can afford better when i would be , that &apos;s great , but my <unk> here &apos;s , that we need to work to work on all the five , and we can never give them an <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> ."
"let &apos;s take the <unk> <unk> fuel fuel fuel , <unk> from either coal or natural gas ."
"so you can have to do it , perhaps easy , but this is not it . you need to get all the co2 that comes from the <unk> , <unk> underneath pressure and <unk> , and they &apos;ll get <unk> , and there ."
"there are some <unk> that <unk> on a 60 percent , 80 percent rate , but it gets to 100 percent become very difficult . and a health system is to get a greater than the co2 on the co2 is a major deal ."
who gets it safe ?
"who can do some <unk> , which may be even bigger as any type of waste you have to imagine from <unk> and other things ?"
that &apos;s a lot of amount of information .
so it &apos;s a hard <unk> .
next : <unk> .
"it &apos;s got three major problems , the costs of everything , particularly in the <unk> countries , and the question for safety of safety , that you actually feel really doesn &apos;t feel wrong , <unk> of the human brain that the <unk> <unk> to the fuel ."
and what do you get with the waste ?
"because although he &apos;s not very big , there are many concerns about ."
so the three extremely difficult problems that perhaps are very <unk> and to work about .
the three of the three of the five has me put .
these are the renewables that are <unk> as often as it &apos;s called .
"and the same too -- although they have great , it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t have a fuel -- they &apos;re <unk> some of the food ."
"one is the <unk> , which will generate this technologies grow dramatically than the use of power ."
"that &apos;s <unk> , we &apos;re talking about many <unk> , <unk> more area than a normal power station ."
"also , <unk> <unk> those <unk> ."
"the sun doesn &apos;t seem that all day , doesn &apos;t seem to seem to be the same day and the wind doesn &apos;t happen every day , and the wind is not always <unk> the wind ."
"that &apos;s why you have to be <unk> from those sources , you have a way to take energy in times when they &apos;re not available ."
"so there &apos;s great power of <unk> . there are challenges in transmission : and if we are saying that the source energy outside of this country , it &apos;s not just to take the technology , it &apos;s also with the risks that the energy from there ."
and there &apos;s the <unk> of it .
"and to show the dimension , i have all the species that produced by batteries , that , the computer , cell phones , layer <unk> , <unk> to everything -- and i did it with the potential of our energy as i could take on the energy , what we used in the amount of the amount of"
"so what we need here is a great <unk> that , something that will be 100 better than the <unk> , at a time ."
"it &apos;s not impossible , but this is not so easy ."
"this is what we try and <unk> those <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re going to bring 20 percent to the <unk> , 30 percent of the <unk> ."
"if you want to have 100 percent to <unk> on this , you need an incredible <unk> ."
"well , where should we go -- what is the right approach ."
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? &quot; how are we going to get into the goal ?
what we need to need is a lot of companies doing this .
"each one in those five areas , we need to do at least 100 human ."
"many , you &apos;ll say that you &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good , well ."
and i think there are lots of them here who are already <unk> over here .
bill has several companies among other companies to have the great <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> into dozens of companies that have really cool things and interesting possibilities and i &apos;ll try to support it .
"nathan <unk> and i have a company that is perhaps an <unk> , the <unk> approach ."
there are several innovations in <unk> ; it &apos;s <unk> .
"so it stopped this industry in this industry a few times ago , so , it &apos;s not a lot of surprise that a few great concepts have <unk> ."
"and the <unk> means that instead of being a part of the <unk> of what a <unk> you do to get , we decided to burn the 99 , and <unk> the cloud <unk> ."
it &apos;s a pretty mad idea .
"but in fact you &apos;ve been thought about this long but you could never make a little bit <unk> , if it worked , yet it was a modern <unk> , and you can see it , yes , ok ."
"and because these 99 percent <unk> , they &apos;re really much better ."
"actually , you get the waste , and you can even use the waste of <unk> today as a <unk> ."
"instead , the <unk> , they burn it . they just <unk> a great thing ."
"so , the uranium &apos;s going to take the <unk> , a little bit like a <unk> ."
"you see that it is sort of <unk> , often when the <unk> wave of reactor ."
the real <unk> is actually the <unk> .
there &apos;s such a picture of <unk> space .
"and that &apos;s the <unk> , the 99 percent . you get the part that &apos;s <unk> today , so it &apos;s <unk> of <unk> uranium ."
this is the <unk> for hundreds of years .
and when you <unk> up and you just pick up <unk> and simply get enough fuel to the planet life of the planet .
"you know , there is many challenges there , but it &apos;s an example of many of <unk> from <unk> , that we need to come forward to step ahead ."
we were going to measure how we should measure our success .
what should we look like to our <unk> ?
"well , let &apos;s go to the goal we need to achieve , so we &apos;ll talk about the <unk> ."
a lot of the 80 percent <unk> to <unk> .
it &apos;s really important to make us .
"the rest of the other 20 percent will get to in the arms of arms , and still , and i will be an agriculture , and , hopefully , is going to be an <unk> and then clean , until it &apos;s been <unk> ."
"so , to get the 80 <unk> to get the <unk> , <unk> countries like china , your <unk> , has just <unk> <unk> ."
"the other grade is that we use the most powerful technology , whether it is used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re <unk> at the way , to keep them ."
that &apos;s a great big deal .
this is an <unk> of that <unk> .
"if you back in there , what should we look like this from 2020 ?"
this should be able to have the two elements . &quot;
"we want to take the <unk> , to make it more <unk> . the less we are less , the more <unk> will be the temperature and the temperature will be too ."
"but in fact , the point of the stuff that we have in company not to move all the big <unk> , just to even more importantly than anything that <unk> the <unk> the innovation that is in charge of that kind of <unk> ."
"so that these <unk> , we need to follow with <unk> and we can measure them on <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> ."
there &apos;s lots of great books to that subject .
"so the al gore &apos;s book , we &apos;ve got the choice &quot; and david <unk> <unk> &apos;s water <unk> the <unk> ."
"they &apos;re really going through it , and they get it a framework where this is happening , because we need for support for all sides to the support ."
there &apos;s a lot of stuff that has to come out .
this is a need .
so a very <unk> wish that we invent this technology .
"and if you just gave me one wish for the next 50 years , i could pick up a vaccine , which was that , and i &apos;m a vaccine , or i could vote that , which is , <unk> without <unk> , you know without co2 ."
that has the biggest effect .
"if we won &apos;t get this wish that we will get in between <unk> and <unk> , people will get terrible people between the u.s. -- between america and the poor and rich and almost all of them will live in a lot of a lot better ."
so what do we have to do ?
what do you do for ?
we need to use more <unk> .
"when countries go in places like <unk> , you shouldn &apos;t be talking about co2 ."
you should go around these <unk> and you &apos;d have been <unk> <unk> by the <unk> <unk> to be spent in some <unk> ways .
"we need food system , increase co2 , <unk> &amp; amp ; center ; something that creates an <unk> ."
we &apos;ve got to move the message .
we have to have tremendous conflict and <unk> and we have the things that go from government to do so .
"it is a great wish , but i think that we can make it ."
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
"thank you very much . just to understand some more , better -- <unk> , can you give us a chance of the <unk> about this investment ?"
"bill gates : to <unk> the <unk> simulation , to give everyone a big scientist , what we did to get out there , we only need a bunch of 10 million , and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in the <unk> <unk> , you can just sound ."
"the hard step is to build the first <unk> , to find another billion , and the <unk> system and actually building the first one in it ."
"so when it &apos;s done , when it &apos;s done , <unk> , it &apos;s all clearly , but the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> is so different as a while we &apos;ve seen ."
"and so to understand that : that means to really go deep into the soil almost like a vertical <unk> <unk> <unk> down the <unk> , and then the process begins to work and work on top and go beyond ?"
"<unk> : exactly . today , you have to go and <unk> the reactor -- so there &apos;s a lot of you can and many people who go back wrong , and this thing , which is where you can open it , <unk> , and no ."
"but if you &apos;re very cheap <unk> , you &apos;re going to take it for 60 years -- remember that <unk> you &apos;re <unk> -- <unk> you , not all the amount of gas ."
"and it &apos;s in and <unk> <unk> 60 years , and it &apos;s finished ."
a nuclear energy that even provides an solution for the trash .
"<unk> : yes . now what happens to the waste -- you can put it in -- there &apos;s a lot of <unk> with this method -- and then they take it and put it into and burn it for the next plane , and burn it ."
"and we &apos;re actually starting to take that waste already that exists in these <unk> or <unk> of <unk> , and that &apos;s where our <unk> is ."
"so what this is a problem that we have was a problem for this <unk> that , in our <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> down to dramatically during this process ."
"but while you &apos;ve spoken with various people of the world , over those kinds of opportunities ."
where &apos;s the biggest interest in this kind of <unk> to do it ?
"<unk> : well we haven &apos;t had an area in a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting <unk> to all this name . there is a <unk> thing about the <unk> , and people saw the <unk> of the <unk> , and china -- it was here , you have been in russia , i &apos;ve"
"i am optimistic . you know , that french and <unk> have made some of them go ."
this is a <unk> of one thing that was done .
"this is the more important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor -- it &apos;s got some areas building that &apos;s why everyone &apos;s building a fast reactor reactor has for our first ."
"and in your vision , the way , <unk> and <unk> of this kind of <unk> <unk> in life ?"
"<unk> : well , we now need to need one of those <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have been able to invent 20 years , and then have 20 years to use ."
"this is just the <unk> we made for <unk> , who <unk> us ."
"and -- you know , <unk> , if it goes well , and this is a lot of the need , it could feel it ."
"and <unk> , today , we have dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of companies to work on what they &apos;re doing for , the <unk> that the <unk> can do for their support ."
"and it would be best if it could create multiple things , because then they might use a mixture ."
"anyway , we need a solution to that ."
"the big amount of <unk> <unk> , is that the biggest one that you &apos;re familiar to ?"
<unk> : a <unk> is <unk> .
"this may have been without any <unk> , but it &apos;s going to do much more important ."
there &apos;s different innovative companies in <unk> <unk> .
"now you know , we don &apos;t know what the work is so good , but there &apos;s a <unk> way to do that &apos;s a different approach ."
"there is a <unk> <unk> that seems to be a hard , but maybe they &apos;ll say this about us ."
"and so there are different things , but the beautiful thing about this is that the energy is a million times as a , we can say , a <unk> and so if they can deal with the issues and almost the power , and the co2 levels , and the nation is the footprint levels ."
if it doesn &apos;t go through what then ?
do you need to make <unk> and try to keep <unk> stable ?
"<unk> : if you go into this situation , it &apos;s just as to eat a much <unk> , just a heart attack is . what do you need ? maybe you need a <unk> or similar ."
"there &apos;s a study called the <unk> , <unk> that <unk> with various techniques to <unk> global warming so that we <unk> 20 or 30 years of <unk> to <unk> us ."
that &apos;s just a <unk> .
and you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
"some people say that you shouldn &apos;t work to be just by insurance because perhaps you should have done that so you can <unk> , because you know , that you can save one ."
"and i know if that is smart , if you &apos;re <unk> the importance of that problem in front of you , but now you have to be able to put in a <unk> <unk> of whether things are available and that longer to take you ."
<unk> : are you having one or two or two <unk> to convince you to <unk> ?
"<unk> : well , unfortunately , <unk> the <unk> in very different <unk> ."
the <unk> of the scientific <unk> are very little .
tell that there are negative effects that are associated with the clouds of the clouds .
"there are very , very few things that you can actually tell to at all of you , a way of a million ."
this <unk> is the very same as as aids with aids .
"now you make the errors , and you pay for that much later ."
"and that &apos;s why the idea , now that if you have all sorts of issues that &apos;s in a position , in something that is just going to happen , and that doesn &apos;t look so clear in fact , the formula , and the treasure ipcc is in effect ."
the fact is that that this one is the uncertainty of it .
"but , my dream here is that if you can take it away , and you know it &apos;s going to <unk> co2 , then the <unk> : &quot; okay , i don &apos;t really <unk> that it &apos;s not to say it , but it &apos;s not much , i &apos;m going to me that i &apos;m almost"
"and that was what their answer would come to the <unk> argument that if you use all this time and power to solve the co2 , you could <unk> all of the other goals , the <unk> of malaria and how much of malaria is so on , it would save money , that ?"
"<unk> : now , the current spending in the research -- let &apos;s say that we &apos;re supposed to spend 10 billion a year than they are today -- this is not dramatic ."
there should be other things that people don &apos;t have .
"you get too big <unk> and then you can disagree with <unk> people if you have something that &apos;s not <unk> and try to fund that . and so , for most of the <unk> is going to be the <unk> of all ."
"you know , we &apos;re very short ago in a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and you &apos;re only going to be the <unk> ; i think we have to do more things that have to be much cheaper ."
"if it &apos;s that you get to <unk> , which is a very high school , it can only keep the rich ."
"i mean , everybody here , could spend five times as much in your energy , without changing the kind of lifestyle ."
"it &apos;s a disaster , but for the lower age ."
and even <unk> thinks about it .
"so his new <unk> is now , &quot; why don &apos;t the research going to <unk> ? &quot;"
"he &apos;s going up , still since his <unk> stories associated with the <unk> , but he understood that he &apos;s got a very rare group , and that is what it takes now ."
and this is a <unk> i think is for <unk> .
"the research , it &apos;s just crazy to how little support is going ."
"bill , i think i &apos;m speaking for almost all of the people here when i say , i really hope you &apos;re true . thank you very much ."
<unk> : thank you .
"so , some years ago , at ted , peter <unk> gave a <unk> called &quot; the &quot; <unk> . &quot;"
"the idea is quite simple . it &apos;s got to take a <unk> structure that &apos;s about 20 <unk> structure , about a <unk> <unk> that <unk> and build a <unk> ."
the <unk> needs it to be on top .
"and even despite that actually it really seems to be really difficult , because you &apos;re <unk> to do very quickly <unk> ."
"and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and what i &apos;ve been turning this into an <unk> <unk> ."
this was a huge successful success .
"so , since i &apos;ve done about 70 <unk> of all around the world , with student and architects , even with architects of the <unk> and there &apos;s some thing about that task , which is <unk> in nature with the nature of the nature of sharing and i want them ."
"and normally , most people start to <unk> themselves from the task of <unk> ."
"you talk about it , you know , what it &apos;s about , it &apos;ll be <unk> to <unk> ."
"they take a bit of time to planning and organization , they <unk> , and they lay out <unk> ."
you invest a huge amount of your time into the <unk> <unk> structures and a whole variety .
"and finally , even before they don &apos;t have time , somebody takes the <unk> and you put it on the top and you &apos;re <unk> at the tip step back to the &quot; <unk> ! you admire her job . &quot;"
"but what happens , almost , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is <unk> &quot; because the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is <unk> , that the whole thing goes <unk> and <unk> ."
"so you have a series of people that have much more and more &quot; <unk> <unk> than others , and under the worst , there are fresh <unk> ."
"they lie , they <unk> , they &apos;re confused , and they really produce <unk> shapes ."
"and of course there are teams that have so much more <unk> in the <unk> have <unk> , <unk> , <unk> is <unk> <unk> from <unk> ."
and that &apos;s fairly interesting .
"how peter <unk> did they make not only the highest towers , and the interesting structure of all ."
"what you might be asking is , what is this ? why ? what about the one ?"
and peter : &quot; no one in kids spend time <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and they spend not spending time in <unk> .
but there &apos;s one more reason .
and that &apos;s that <unk> used to be treated for the right plan and try it .
and then they realize it .
"and what happens to you when you put the back on top of that , you don &apos;t have time , and what happens ?"
it &apos;s a crisis .
"sounds familiar , what ?"
"and what <unk> are doing is they start building with the <unk> and building prototypes , <unk> , always with the very <unk> at the top that they have <unk> prototype to solve the possibility to repair ."
"now , <unk> recognize these kinds of collaboration as a <unk> <unk> ."
"and in any trial , they get <unk> feedback that worked on and doesn &apos;t work ."
"this is performance working with prototypes to work , but we &apos;re seeing how smart teams are ."
"the average for most of the average is about <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> that are , lawyers have a little longer , but not a lot more than the adult are better than adults ."
who &apos;s in most successful ?
"architects and engineers , fortunately , are lucky ."
<unk> is the ultimate thing i saw .
and why ? because you understand the way and the <unk> patterns are the keys to build intelligent structures .
<unk> tend to get on average . but that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting .
"you put a <unk> <unk> into the team , they become better ."
"it &apos;s incredibly , you can see and recognize this team will be called . &quot;"
you can predict that . why is that going ?
because they had particular <unk> of the skills .
"they <unk> the process , they <unk> the process ."
"and that team , the <unk> and <unk> , the work will improve the performance of teams of the <unk> ."
<unk> skills and <unk> and <unk> their combination will lead to success .
"when they have 10 teams that are typical of the <unk> , you get about 40 who have a stable form ."
now i tried to make some <unk> .
i thought we &apos;ll take the <unk> right now .
so i offered a $ $ $ <unk> for the <unk> .
and what do they believe with that kind of thing ?
what was the result ?
"it &apos;s happening . not a team , had a stable shape ."
"if <unk> built an <unk> high , he had a <unk> at the home ."
is that not interesting that high <unk> have a strong effect ?
we <unk> this <unk> with the same student .
what do you believe in it ?
now understand the advantage of the <unk> .
"so from the same , bad team of a <unk> team has been <unk> ."
they were used the highest building in the least time .
"so we have <unk> lessons for us to think about nature , and success ."
"you may ask , why would anyone really invest time to create a <unk> ?"
"and because of that , i think , <unk> digital tools and <unk> create tools to help teams design video games and &quot; <unk> &quot; and to create the <unk> ."
"and what the <unk> does is to identify you , helps to identify <unk> ."
"because frankly , every project &apos;s got their own <unk> ."
"the challenge gives us a shared experience , which is a common language , <unk> , building the real <unk> ."
"and this is the value of that experience , so simple exercise ."
and those of you who are interested in <unk> can be visited .
"it &apos;s an blog , where you see it , as you can build the <unk> ."
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
"and they find some crazy examples of all the world , like people are <unk> and <unk> ."
they are <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s the most important lesson i think that this is actually a real sport .
"it &apos;s making sure that we all have our sense to this , and that we use our thought to be <unk> , how our feelings and do our , in the challenge that we &apos;re in front of us ."
"and sometimes a small <unk> of that experience , all it needs to make us make a difference &quot; -- to a <unk> <unk> ."
and that can do a big difference .
thank you .
"and as we could do here , here &apos;s a machine ."
"one big machine , a big machine , <unk> machine , and that &apos;s a piece of machine ."
and everyone in that room must be in there .
"and you can go into the past , you can go to the future , you cannot go here here in the right now ."
"and i &apos;m asking you , what would you want to choose because i &apos;ve asked my friends at the past time and they all had to go to the past ."
"i don &apos;t know . you &apos;d like back in the time before there were cars or twitter , you know , &quot; america is the head of the <unk> . &quot;"
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve convinced you that you &apos;re sort of going to <unk> <unk> .
and it &apos;s a understand .
"i &apos;m not part of the group , i have to say ."
"i don &apos;t like in the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> ."
"it &apos;s because possibilities that opportunities are not going to be coming back on this planet , you go forward ."
so i want to go into this machine . and i want to go into the future .
"this is the most amazing times that there had been on this planet , no matter which scale you to this , health , wealth and opportunities ."
there was never a time like that .
and my favorite <unk> died every one that died when they were 60 .
my grandparents were <unk> these number in <unk> .
and my parents are the 80 at the <unk> .
so there was better one at least nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
"but people are not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than the ones ."
a child who &apos;s in <unk> now can expect to live so long as <unk> as the rest of the world &apos;s husband on 100 years ago .
think about it . it &apos;s a incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox have been billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve <unk> <unk> the earth into something like no war to the same .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re disappeared .
we <unk> them . we <unk> them .
"in the <unk> world exist that <unk> millions of us have only <unk> of one generation , hardly even yet ."
"<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ..."
anyone even knows what this is ?
"<unk> , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that &apos;s <unk> &apos;s scientific way ."
"and from my view is the scientific method , <unk> , looking at if it &apos;s going to change it , you change it if it does not , a <unk> of humanity &apos;s <unk> ."
so this is the good news .
"unfortunately , that &apos;s a good news story , because there &apos;s some different problems , and they &apos;re already known to be there ."
"and one of them is that despite all of our <unk> , one billion human beings going to bed against <unk> each other a day ."
"that number goes and it goes a very quickly , and it &apos;s <unk> ."
and that &apos;s not only the thing we did is to <unk> the world as a <unk> .
"<unk> , <unk> land , <unk> and <unk> , oil . they go out , and it &apos;s soon , and we don &apos;t <unk> from this chaos ."
"so the question is , can we do this ? i think that &apos;s ."
"i think that &apos;s clear that we can create food that is going to feed billions of people without <unk> that it &apos;s on , to <unk> ."
i think we can power that world with energy that doesn &apos;t <unk> them at the same time .
"i &apos;m really , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> ."
"but this is my own lie in night -- one of these things that keep me awake at night , and we have really no need scientific progress in the moment never before ."
and we were also still in the way to make it <unk> as to what we can do today .
"we &apos;ve been at the <unk> of amazing events , <unk> of many areas , and i think we really have hundreds of 300 years before the <unk> go back to find a period where we &apos;ve been able to actually <unk> things ."
"people are <unk> themselves , and they &apos;re so <unk> that you couldn &apos;t <unk> them ."
and not even that truth will be free .
"and hear them , every place it has a right in their sense , even an one in their mind , too ."
but you know what you &apos;re not right ?
"they don &apos;t have any right to their own facts , &apos; <unk> -- they don &apos;t have it ."
and i &apos;ve spent a while trying that .
"i &apos;ve written a article about 11 , i wrote a paper for <unk> &quot; new yorker , a little article ."
"and i was amazed by resistance , to <unk> the <unk> to what the end <unk> in human health is the most effective health care in history ."
"i didn &apos;t understand what i was about , so i just did the always i always do . i wrote a paper and went on ."
and soon i wrote an article on <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
"same thing , just bigger ."
people played nuts .
"so i wrote about this article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people think they &apos;d be called &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believe molecules in a certain way of a <unk> kind of <unk> <unk> in nature ."
"but you know what i &apos;m doing , i am doing that . i &apos;d written the article , i kept on ."
"i mean , i &apos;m a journalist ."
"we &apos;re hungry , we <unk> , we are rich eating , that &apos;s okay ."
"but i didn &apos;t worry about this article , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and ultimately , i found it out ."
and that &apos;s because these <unk> <unk> made me crazy actually not anything .
"these were <unk> people , <unk> people , people ."
they were just like the people in this room .
and that brought me together <unk> ...
"but then i thought you knew what , we &apos;re honest ."
we &apos;re at some point when we &apos;re not going to have the same kind of relationship with development as a <unk> .
we talk about <unk> .
"we &apos;re talking about <unk> with little <unk> that is , &quot; progress . &quot;"
"okay , so there is reasons , and i guess why these are the reasons ."
"we &apos;ve got trust the trust , <unk> , and sometimes to the science of it , there &apos;s no matter why it &apos;s not ."
"and you can say some names , and people will understand the names ."
"in the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , the 2,000 <unk> , the 2,000 2,000 2000 ."
"i mean , you know , you can choose your own list ."
there are problems and problems with people that we thought they were pretty <unk> .
"ask them , ask the evidence for <unk> , they demand it ."
don &apos;t have any one another than any one .
"but now it &apos;s going to be : when you have evidence to get this evidence of <unk> , and you &apos;re not good at it ."
"and i can say this out of the reasons , we &apos;re now in a <unk> <unk> , like i haven &apos;t seen them , and hopefully i &apos;ll never be seen again ."
"around about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible history that was <unk> with the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine led to the relationship ."
it &apos;s very <unk> .
<unk> studies have been done to see if that was true .
<unk> studies have been conducted on research ; that &apos;s a serious deal .
the data came in .
"the data came in from the united states , from the u.k. , canada , from canada , in <unk> all of them , and they were all about <unk> , not any link , none ."
"it does not make a difference . it doesn &apos;t necessarily make difference because we believe in a belief that we think what we &apos;re seeing to see what &apos;s going on , which we feel really , really , really , we feel ."
"we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of data that gives us a <unk> that is data that i understand , and i think we all do ."
but do you know what ?
and the outcome of this was <unk> .
"<unk> because of that fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where it &apos;s <unk> for <unk> and down ."
"this is a <unk> , and we should make up ."
it &apos;s terrible .
what happened is that we could do that .
"well , i understand this . that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing ."
because does anybody have an <unk> here ?
has a <unk> in the audience who &apos;s going to see someone dying ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
"no time in this country is happening , but even in the world , last year ."
these are many <unk> <unk> by <unk> 20 .
"but because of that , that &apos;s not what happens here , we can get it out , and people like stephen hawking , and we can do <unk> messages from fear , and <unk> , of all the king <unk> and larry <unk> ."
and they can do that because it &apos;s not <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
"they don &apos;t understand they seem to be the same , except almost never are the same ."
"so this is something we need to learn to learn to , which is very quickly ."
"this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> ."
he <unk> us of one of the worst <unk> human mind .
"no fear , it &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> , gone ."
the guy who &apos;s not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
it &apos;s built just with several different people a <unk> .
"he can save their lives of the <unk> , <unk> children in the developing world ."
pretty good .
"well , this is good , except to talk to paul walking and talking about <unk> and saying how valuable you are , that people should stop to stop ."
and he says that in fact .
so paul is a dolphin man .
"when paul talks in a public war , he can &apos;t tell any <unk> <unk> ."
"he &apos;s got <unk> from home , because people like to tell him that they know how he can &apos;t come to school ."
and why ? why is paul made a vaccine .
"i don &apos;t need that , but <unk> <unk> are ."
"you go ahead and get the <unk> to do that happen , terrible disease , and that is what &apos;s happening now ."
"now , we have <unk> in that country now ."
"and that gets worse , and rather than kids are going to die , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers ."
and they &apos;re not going to die of <unk> .
what about <unk> ? we take this . what ?
"so a <unk> i was writing a couple of weeks ago , and said i was a little bit <unk> ."
no one ever told this before .
"she wouldn &apos;t give her child against <unk> , no , no way ."
<unk> .
why ? why don &apos;t we have <unk> . and we know what ?
we had no longer had <unk> in this country yesterday .
"today , i can &apos;t know it that &apos;s going to be there in lagos every day in a plane and flies going to los angeles , on the moment , it &apos;s about <unk> ."
"and so , in a couple of hours , he gets into the car and it &apos;s going to come out for <unk> , and it &apos;ll have one of the <unk> , and the <unk> is going to come to a <unk> tonight ."
"and it doesn &apos;t know that he can be infected with a <unk> disease and we don &apos;t know that as well , as the world works ."
"and this is the planet that we live , not doing as if it &apos;s not that ."
we love to <unk> us into lies <unk> . we love this .
have you taken every tomorrow in <unk> tomorrow ?
"<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you <unk> them to the <unk> ."
i know you did that for half the americans doing that every day .
"they &apos;re taking the stuff , and they take alternative to alternative , and we don &apos;t make the difference as often we figure out that they are useless ."
the data <unk> the time .
they &apos;re going to make them more <unk> . no longer they never do .
"so that &apos;s okay , they like to take 28 billion dollars for dark numbers ."
i <unk> it all out .
it &apos;s dark <unk> . it &apos;s dark .
why are we doing that ? what are we doing this ?
"well , i think i understand -- we hate the <unk> ."
we hate an strong government . we don &apos;t have trust into the system .
and we should not do that too . our health system is <unk> .
it is being <unk> by millions of people .
it &apos;s totally <unk> and <unk> ourselves that can afford you .
"so we run away , so where are the way to walk ?"
we run <unk> in <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
"now , you know , that &apos;s really an seriously issue , because the thing is <unk> , and we &apos;re going to spend billions of dollars in this ."
and i put up all kinds of little <unk> here .
"<unk> of this -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that &apos;s what i don &apos;t even know about , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars for this ."
"and you know what ? when i say that , i say people <unk> me and said , &quot; what care ? do people want to do what they want ."
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
and know what ? they have wrong .
"because i don &apos;t care if it is the <unk> saying , &quot; <unk> me , i &apos;m going to not be the <unk> of mine &apos;s experts or any <unk> to treat the patient or any one to treat your patient with <unk> ."
"if they <unk> into that way , where belief and magic <unk> and science , they &apos;ll be on a place where they don &apos;t want to be ."
they get up to south africa .
"and he gave <unk> to people because he had that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and lots of <unk> to be much more <unk> of who we know the course of aids ."
tens of hundreds of thousands <unk> of death <unk> in a country that is <unk> worse than each other of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
you have those . they always have them .
"now , the <unk> <unk> that we are sitting in , these <unk> <unk> <unk> between the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> ."
this is an amazing debate : it must stop .
"it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors ."
"it &apos;s ideology , not science ."
"everything that we feed is eating , each <unk> , every <unk> branch , every single <unk> , was changed by people ."
"they know , there &apos;s no <unk> <unk> in garden ."
there were no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we &apos;ve made that thing .
we &apos;ve done it in the last <unk> years .
and <unk> that has worked and doesn &apos;t work .
"we are more <unk> , which is not working ."
"you can do it more . and of course , there &apos;s risks that , but we can do something like <unk> a <unk> a a to rice , and that stuff can help people make them , millions of people , your life ."
they don &apos;t want to do that ?
i must say it &apos;s no .
we are <unk> <unk> food .
why do you do that ?
"well , what i hear all is : too many chemicals , these pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to have any enormous fields in a <unk> ."
we don &apos;t really want companies to live <unk> .
we don &apos;t want companies to have the <unk> .
"and you know , what my answer to all of that ?"
you have a right . we <unk> that .
"it &apos;s true , we have a major <unk> , but it &apos;s not science ."
it doesn &apos;t have to do with science .
"it &apos;s quite a , moral , <unk> ."
you know the science is no business .
it &apos;s not land .
it &apos;s not a concept once . it &apos;s an process .
"it is a process , and it &apos;s sometimes it working , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but it &apos;s the idea that the science &apos;s not allowed to do with us to do the <unk> , because it &apos;s really a <unk> of millions of people ."
"so you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to have 70 percent more food than right now . 70 percent ."
these investment investment in africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
"they need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them ."
and why ? <unk> changed .
we don &apos;t want people to eat this terrible stuff as <unk> .
so <unk> is something that food <unk> a half billion people .
it &apos;s about a <unk> .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it is <unk> .
"it has not an <unk> , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists make all of this in the front place ."
and then people could eat it and would not be blind .
"they wouldn &apos;t die , and you know what ?"
"so that &apos;s fine . it wouldn &apos;t be nice , but it &apos;d be nice ."
and everything i can say about is that why are we doing this ?
"i mean , let &apos;s ask us , why do we <unk> that ?"
because we do not have to <unk> genes ?
it &apos;s about <unk> genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
"it &apos;s not about our <unk> passion for hormones , our <unk> on larger <unk> , better food , food ."
"it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , which is about getting people live and getting the first time to understand the thing that means ."
because do you know something ?
"now if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so much as we do so on something that we &apos;re going to be on , we &apos;re sure , not being <unk> , to <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
there &apos;s no other description of what happens here .
"it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not our <unk> , and we really have to stop that ."
"you know , when you get incredibly <unk> <unk> , and you might say , &quot; do you &apos;re going to have this <unk> time and go into the future ? &quot;"
"in any case , that i want to do every case ."
"right now she &apos;s right now in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity ."
"we can put the time on this machine , what we want ."
"we can go through them where they would like , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want to go ."
"we have to take this stuff and we have to think , but if we go to <unk> , we go into the time . we &apos;re going to be happy to have done this ."
"and i know we can , and in terms of it , this is something that needs right now ."
thank you .
thank you .
"and for a time i &apos;ve been interested in the business school <unk> . it looks like a <unk> <unk> is interested in doing it &apos;s because they look like myself , when i believe that one is very short than someone who &apos;s really happy in them ."
"in other words , <unk> have shown in some <unk> effect on the <unk> , <unk> , just because the person &apos;s thinking , a <unk> , one is a <unk> , just in -- for example , in the <unk> , if you have an <unk> , in the patient , the <unk> , there , there ."
"one illusion becomes something that &apos;s really real , because someone is <unk> it ."
"and that &apos;s a way to get us to understand , i &apos;d like to show you a very simple , very simple <unk> ."
"and i &apos;ll show you , like he works . this is a trick that has been at least since the 1950s in every child &apos;s <unk> ."
i &apos;ve learned him from the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the 1970s .
i will take it and tell it .
and i will explain why i &apos;ll get it .
"so , you see what happens ."
the knife they can look at . my hand you can look at .
i &apos;ll just give the knife so easily .
i got back my <unk> .
"and to make a lot of sure that nothing is going to be out of the <unk> <unk> , and from him , i &apos;ll just leave my wrist right for it here ."
"in this way , you can see that at least there are no time moving . as long as i go there , nothing can go to my <unk> <unk> and <unk> ."
and the goal of that is very easy .
"and i &apos;d open my hand and hopefully if everything goes good , the balloon will <unk> through my naked <unk> ."
"in fact , it &apos;s actually stuck in the place that i &apos;m able to shake and <unk> without the knife ."
"no one <unk> up into my <unk> , it &apos;s not <unk> . and you can study everything ."
<unk> !
"now , that &apos;s a trick that i often get small kids who are about <unk> , because you can teach about a lot of deception by learning , even as you look very carefully , that it &apos;s a very simple trick for that &apos;s ."
"now , probably many of you know in this room are this trick ."
he works that way .
i &apos;m going to hold it in my hands .
"and i say , i &apos;ll put my wrist , to make sure that nothing disappears in my <unk> or fall out of it , and it &apos;s a <unk> ."
the reason why i <unk> my wrist is that there is the actual secret of illusion .
"because at the point where i <unk> my hands , therefore they look at them from back , this fingers <unk> up to me , just my <unk> <unk> , where it was , where they were in a position he &apos;s going on ."
great trick ?
"at the back , somebody who had no childhood ."
"okay , so he &apos;s there . right ?"
"and so , if i come out , the fingers changes his position ."
"and now we could talk about why that &apos;s <unk> about how you don &apos;t tell you , just see three fingers here , because the mind and the way the way that information is <unk> it , it does is not going , two , three ."
but that &apos;s why it &apos;s really not right now . and it &apos;s i open up my hand .
"of course , it becomes more <unk> , but not by the <unk> of my body , but by a trick , through my <unk> , that is there now ."
"and if i leave my hand , this is the same way by <unk> i move through that movement is <unk> to <unk> the fingers ."
i take the hand off . and here is the knife .
this trick you can <unk> your friends and neighbors . thank you .
so what does that do with the <unk> system ?
i was reading one year or so i was reading a study which has really <unk> to me .
"i &apos;m not a doctor or scientists , so it was an astonishing thing for me ."
"it &apos;s because this thing , as it is : when you offer a <unk> to a white station , in which you have a <unk> , it &apos;s just a round pill , white pill , which has a certain effect ."
"but if you <unk> the shape in which you <unk> into the <unk> , for example , in a smaller ball and these blue pill and a letter <unk> to you , is actually <unk> <unk> ."
"and so , although not a <unk> for some of these -- it &apos;s just a <unk> ."
but one white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? i did that really feel my mind .
it turned out that it &apos;s not all .
"when you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re more efficient than any each <unk> ."
so one <unk> <unk> that &apos;s yellow at one <unk> and on the other red is better than one white <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> plays a role .
one pill twice is not so good as three wood -- i couldn &apos;t remind you about the exact statistics . sorry ?
"it &apos;s <unk> , right , ..."
"well , that <unk> also play a role ."
and the shape plays a role .
"and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to reach out to the needle ."
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- some <unk> of a <unk> of substance that you were <unk> a patient .
"this creates a very <unk> image in mind , and that is very much stronger than one white pill ."
"this graph is really -- i &apos;ll show you another time , when we have a <unk> ."
"so in fact , that the white pill isn &apos;t as well as <unk> as the black pill that don &apos;t just <unk> as well as a <unk> that didn &apos;t get as well as a needle ."
"and there is nothing that really <unk> a <unk> to this , and it &apos;s really just our believe that in <unk> that makes us a stronger impact ."
i had to know if i could use this idea of a <unk> .
"i take some <unk> , clearly , the deception , and let it go ."
"we know that in the study that they have to reach out for a needle , if they ought to go to the thing ."
"and this is a 18 inch of <unk> long <unk> , and it &apos;s very , very <unk> , and i &apos;ll start to <unk> a little bit ."
this is really my <unk> . it &apos;s not <unk> special meat <unk> .
this is my skin . this is not a <unk> in hollywood .
"so i &apos;ll put that needle on my skin , and through her to take away , until you move it to the other side ."
"if you &apos;re <unk> -- if you get easy in <unk> -- i &apos;ve got a couple of friends last night in <unk> , and some people that i don &apos;t know , and there &apos;s a woman that &apos;s <unk> <unk> ."
"so i &apos;ll just go <unk> , if you &apos;re very quickly <unk> , then look for the next 30 seconds . or you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first <unk> of this in front ."
"you can see the same as the same thing , but you can also see that if they want it to ."
"so , the same , where my <unk> starts , the bottom of my <unk> is just about to do a small small <unk> ."
i &apos;m really sorry . do it crazy ?
and just a little bit through through my skin and on the other hand as it happens .
now we &apos;re in the same situation we did .
about .
"but now , you can &apos;t count my finger ."
"so , i &apos;ll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five ."
"okay , now ."
"i know what people think , when you see it ."
"they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not that <unk> and <unk> itself up with the skin , just for just for us to <unk> a few minutes . &quot;"
well now i &apos;d just show it .
and what this looks like ? pretty good .
"yeah , well , i know ."
"and people say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen that right . &quot;"
people are going to be all over the <unk> .
let me show you the close one you .
that &apos;s really my skin . and that &apos;s not <unk> from hollywood .
"this is my meat , and it &apos;s the <unk> ."
"sorry . if you get <unk> , look , don &apos;t look up ."
"and people , the people , or the <unk> , will look at it a moment , say , &quot; well , it looks pretty <unk> , but if it was real , it would look , it was <unk> and there was a <unk> , really if she &apos;s a hole , and she &apos;s a hole here"
"ok , let me take a little blood ."
"yes , it &apos;s here ."
so i would usually <unk> the needle .
i would take my arm and show you that there are no <unk> .
"but i think this <unk> here , and i have the purpose of doing this kind of illusion to make something real , i will just put it in there , and so on stage ."
and we are going to be a few times through the next few days .
and i hope you &apos;re going to be excited . thank you very .
everybody talks about the happiness of us .
"i &apos;ve been taking several people that are <unk> numbers of books which were published in my book in the last five years , and they gave you about about 40 years on the last few years , and there were many more ."
there &apos;s a massive wave of happiness in <unk> .
there are a lot of progress on this .
everybody would like to make people &apos;s <unk> .
"but despite these <unk> of work , there are multiple cognitive cognitive <unk> , which are just possible , so <unk> to happiness ."
and my talk today is mostly going to fall in the way of this cognitive practice .
"that &apos;s true about <unk> , the <unk> , thinking about her own <unk> and the <unk> of scientists that are thinking about happiness because that we &apos;re <unk> are so <unk> to how any others are ."
"the first ones of these <unk> is a <unk> , <unk> to <unk> ."
"it turns out , the word &quot; happiness &quot; is simply not a useful word &quot; because we apply it to lots of different things ."
"i think there &apos;s a very particular kind of importance to which we could just be able to , but all the time we have to give up , and you get the <unk> view of <unk> to what is <unk> well-being ."
"so the second one is that of the <unk> <unk> and memory is : basically it &apos;s being very happy between life and happy about being alive , or his life ."
"and they &apos;re both very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the imagination of happiness ."
"now the third is the main thing , and that &apos;s the most <unk> fact that you don &apos;t think of a kind of fact that we can &apos;t think about the issue without <unk> the well-being ."
i mean this is a real cognitive device .
there is just no way of getting that .
"now i &apos;d like to start with you a example of somebody who had a <unk> of mine when he said a story . <unk> ... <unk> said he had a <unk> <unk> , and it was absolutely wonderful and <unk> ."
"and then he added , really emotionally , it &apos;s got the whole experience ."
but that didn &apos;t .
what had the most <unk> had on experience .
he had experience the experience .
he used 20 minutes of <unk> music .
they didn &apos;t realize it because it was <unk> to a memory of <unk> -- it was <unk> and that memory was all about what he had to keep the <unk> .
what this really says is that we could think about and think about other people in the sense of two types of self .
"there &apos;s a real <unk> self in the present , and the <unk> knows that is able to experience the past , but just the present has ."
"it &apos;s the <unk> itself , the physician &apos;s going to come up with -- you know , if the doctor &apos;s asking me , right now , when i do you <unk> this one ? &quot;"
"and then there &apos;s an <unk> self , and the <unk> themselves is it , <unk> and <unk> history of our life , and it &apos;s the doctor of a <unk> to <unk> the ask , &quot; how did you get on time ? &quot;"
&quot; or &quot; how about your journey to <unk> ? &quot; or something like that .
"these are two very different <unk> , which <unk> themselves and the most <unk> themselves , and the two of them is part of the learning of the <unk> of happiness ."
"well , it &apos;s the <unk> themselves , a <unk> ."
and that &apos;s really really starting with an <unk> reaction to our <unk> -- it starts immediately starts .
we &apos;re not going to say stories about the story of telling stories .
"our memory tells us stories , which is that we &apos;ve been <unk> from what we &apos;re going to get is a story ."
and let &apos;s <unk> <unk> with one example .
there &apos;s an old study that is .
these are real patients who are <unk> with an <unk> <unk> .
"i won &apos;t go into detail . they &apos;re not even <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t painful as it was done as this study in the <unk> ."
they were asked to <unk> every 60 seconds about their pain .
and there are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re going to be asked by who two have more <unk> ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
"the patient <unk> has much more <unk> . and its <unk> <unk> was <unk> , every minute the plane had a <unk> a <unk> b , and more ."
"but is there another question , &quot; how did you think they had patient suffered ? &quot;"
and this is an surprise .
and the surprising thing is that patient has a much worse <unk> at <unk> .
"the stories of <unk> were different because , because a very <unk> part of history of the story they &apos;re just about what they &apos;re going to end ..."
"and no stories , these stories are very <unk> or great -- but one of them is that <unk> <unk> ..."
but one of them is clearly <unk> to the other .
"and that , the worse , it was that , if the pain was at the peak at the end was in the peak , there is a horrible story ."
so how do we know this ?
"because we asked those people after their <unk> , and a much later , &quot; how bad was all the whole thing ? &quot;"
and she was much worse for a a <unk> in a state of <unk> in <unk> .
"well , that &apos;s a <unk> conflict between <unk> itself and <unk> itself ."
and the view of <unk> itself was an even larger period .
"well , what you might have , with the patient , we could actually do clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s really , you could actually <unk> that <unk> from a <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in it without it ."
"that &apos;s going to happen that the patient has <unk> , but it &apos;s just a bit less than much of the patient ."
"and if you did this for a few minutes , you do this , the <unk> is <unk> itself as a bad patient and you have made that the <unk> himself of a a lot better <unk> than it has a chance to make a child a big experience ."
<unk> is a tale of <unk> ?
"and it is true for the stories that <unk> it <unk> and it <unk> with the stories , that we create ."
"<unk> <unk> : a story of <unk> are <unk> , <unk> <unk> and end ."
"end very , very important , and in this case , <unk> <unk> the end ."
"well , the <unk> self &apos;s <unk> life ."
"it &apos;s got moments in the <unk> , one in the rest of the time ."
"and they wonder , what happens to these <unk> ?"
and the answer is really simple . you &apos;ve lost forever .
"i mean , most of our lives of our lives -- and i have the <unk> -- you know what the present <unk> is about three seconds . what means , you know , in a <unk> , there are nothing in 600 million of you in a month ."
most of them will become completely different from all of them <unk> .
"and yet , somehow they &apos;re going to have the idea that they should count what was happening during these moments of <unk> our lives is our lives ."
"it &apos;s a limited resource that we consume , and we consume the earth ."
"as we would use them to be important , but it is no history that <unk> the most important for us ."
"so we <unk> the self , and the self self , and they &apos;re quite quite <unk> ."
the biggest difference between them is the <unk> of time .
"and then from the <unk> self , when you &apos;re on a <unk> , when it &apos;s just like the second , it &apos;s exactly the first , then the first one <unk> <unk> has twice as well as the <unk> of <unk> ."
so it doesn &apos;t work for the <unk> even of the <unk> .
"for the <unk> itself is a <unk> on a <unk> of <unk> , because there was no new <unk> <unk> ."
they didn &apos;t changed the story .
"and in this way , that &apos;s actually the critical <unk> that makes a <unk> <unk> itself is quite different from an <unk> self . time has a very much effect on this story ."
"now , even the <unk> makes more <unk> than to remember and telling stories ."
"in fact , this makes the choices for you who have a patient , who , say , two , two <unk> , in two surgeons , and has to <unk> , which one is he , the most <unk> , is the memory which has less <unk> ."
it has no voice of that choice .
"actually , we don &apos;t choose between <unk> . we choose to <unk> <unk> in between <unk> ."
"and even when we think about the future , we usually believe in our future when we &apos;re not <unk> ."
we think about the future after the <unk> of <unk> .
"and basically , you see this , you know , when one of the <unk> itself , and you can think about it , as one is a thing that <unk> , to <unk> , with some of them , that doesn &apos;t really take ."
"i have the impression that we have a very often the case is , we have a <unk> of what <unk> do to keep <unk> ."
so that &apos;s a little bit hard to think .
"i mean , how much does we <unk> of our <unk> ?"
this is one of the <unk> that is given for the <unk> of the <unk> self .
"and as i go over this , i think we &apos;ve had a <unk> that we made a few years from antarctica , which was clearly the first one i &apos;ve had , that ever had , and i think , a relatively <unk> in the other relationship ."
"and i probably had that <unk> about this <unk> journey , so , i would tell about 25 minutes of <unk> in the last four years ."
"now if i have to even have been <unk> with the open pictures in there , i &apos;ve spent another hour ."
"well , these are three weeks , and this is three and a half and a half hours ."
there seems to be a <unk> .
"but , i like a little <unk> , you know , like little <unk> i <unk> on how little of <unk> , but , even , if you do more of it , what are the real question we spend so much more <unk> in the <unk> ?"
so i would think that they &apos;re thinking about this thought thought .
"imagine your next vacation <unk> , you know , at the end of the <unk> , all its images are <unk> -- it &apos;s going to be a <unk> unit , so that you &apos;re going to remember nothing ."
"well , would you vote for the same <unk> ?"
"and if they had to have a new level , there is a conflict between both of you and you have to think about this conflict and that &apos;s really , if you don &apos;t think of a chance and if you could start with the answer for yourself ."
why we choose the <unk> that we &apos;re going to take a issue that gives us with a choice between the two of those species of itself .
"so , the two types of self would throw two terms of happiness ."
"there &apos;s actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , which one of self ."
"you can ask , how happy is this <unk> itself ?"
"and would you ask , how happy are the moments in the lifetime of self ?"
and these are all the -- happiness for these moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that are measured ?
"and by the way , now , we are now a very good idea of getting at the happiness , ourselves , is about time <unk> ."
"when you go and ask for happiness , it &apos;s a different thing ."
this is not what happy person &apos;s living .
and it &apos;s about how bad or <unk> is the one person to think about that person .
very <unk> term .
"everybody who is doing the kind of thing not different from happiness to happiness , and i &apos;m starting to create a variety of <unk> about well-being in studying the exploration of happiness for long as long as we have in the right place ."
"and <unk> between happiness in the <unk> itself and the <unk> of self has been discovered within the last few years , and now you &apos;ve got the two <unk> to measure the size ."
"the <unk> court <unk> a global fund for more than half a million people asked what you &apos;ve been thinking about your life and the people were doing about <unk> , and it was there different in the direction ."
so over the last few years we started to learn from the <unk> that two of themselves are learning .
and the main thing we do that is i think it &apos;s learned that they &apos;re really different .
"and you can know how anyone with your life is , and it really doesn &apos;t really feel much about how happy it lives and <unk> ."
just giving you a sense of the <unk> that the <unk> is about <unk> .
"so what that means is that if you meet someone , and you would say , oh , be his father a <unk> , how much would you know about his size ?"
"well you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty ."
you have so much uncertainty .
when i say you &apos;re in a scale you &apos;ve seen that you &apos;ve seen eight times on how much more uncertainty is it is to be with your own <unk> .
so the <unk> is low .
we know something about what the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
"we know that money is very important to do goals , goals are very important ."
"we know that happiness means to be satisfied , being alive to people we might like a time with people we may have ."
"there are other pleasure , however , that &apos;s <unk> ."
"so if you are lucky to <unk> the number one species of self , at the end you &apos;re going to get very different things done ."
the <unk> from what i said here is we should really be happy than an <unk> for <unk> .
it is a completely different term .
"well , in short , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we cannot consider to the same things when you &apos;re about life and if we really live ."
"if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california , they &apos;re not going to have the most <unk> response to the answer ."
"and when they think the question is , if you think about it that the people are to be at california , if you &apos;re going to say , what we &apos;re going to live in <unk> ."
"and what happens is , if you go to your life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference consists , we say , climate -- climate ."
"well it turned out that climate isn &apos;t very important to the <unk> self , and , it &apos;s not quite important to <unk> self , as happy as people are ."
"now because , because the most expensive itself can be <unk> , you could end up with the end -- some of people could pull from california ."
and it &apos;s kind of <unk> what happens to the people who pull california into hope for hope to become <unk> .
"well , your own <unk> itself isn &apos;t going to be <unk> ."
we know that .
"but a thing is going to happen . you will think about it , because when you think about it will be remembered , as <unk> as <unk> was in <unk> , and you feel that you &apos;re getting the right decision ."
"it &apos;s very difficult , to think about comfort , and i hope i &apos;m giving you a sense of how difficult ."
thank you .
thanks . i have a question of you .
thank you .
"now as we had a couple of weeks ago , and they mentioned me to the <unk> that there was an pretty interesting result that it comes from this survey ."
"is that something they can get from , because they have a few minutes right now ?"
daniel <unk> : sure .
"and i think , the <unk> conclusion that we found in the world bank has been a number that we &apos;ve had not been expected to find ."
so we found this at the level of happiness in the <unk> .
"if we <unk> , like emotions can vary income ."
"and it turns out that there &apos;s an <unk> income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that is a very large sample of <unk> , about 800 , and it &apos;s a huge <unk> , among a $ 100 inch in half ."
"60,000 ."
"<unk> : 60,000 ."
"60,000 dollars a year are people unhappy , and they will get more <unk> , they will be <unk> ."
that &apos;s where we get a completely <unk> line .
"i mean , i &apos;ve seen <unk> <unk> lines ."
"what happens is obviously that money doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , but lack of money on a <unk> for sure we can measure it in a <unk> and we can measure this very clearly , very clear ."
"in the sense of another self , the <unk> itself , you get another story ."
the longer you make the money you <unk> your <unk> .
that is the thing that &apos;s not true for emotion .
"but danny , in all the american community , it &apos;s all about life , freedoms , for <unk> for <unk> ."
"and when i think people would take care about this one , i mean , this is all <unk> to the head that we think is <unk> for example as well as it goes up ."
"are there a chance of saying that politicians , that the country in general might take some point like the right now and would do the policy ?"
"<unk> : you know , i think there &apos;s an <unk> to the role in politics in politics ."
"the <unk> will slow into the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , it is going right now , in other countries as they are happening ."
"people are aware that they should be lucky , if they think of politics ."
"it &apos;ll take a while , and people will have a lot , do you want to investigate whether or to explore or how you want to study <unk> , so we need to take that discussion pretty soon ."
"as you can get very <unk> , very much <unk> on how it can think and think about how they think it <unk> even , or can think of what &apos;s the <unk> itself ."
"that &apos;s going to influence politics , i think , in the <unk> years ."
"and in the united states , you have to measure <unk> <unk> of the population as well ."
"that &apos;s the <unk> , i think , in the next one or two decades , will be part of the national statistics ."
"now , i think it &apos;s a <unk> or should at least the <unk> political <unk> will continue to pursue the next few years ."
thank you for the invention of <unk> .
"thank you , danny <unk> ."
i &apos;m jane <unk> . i <unk> <unk> .
"so , i &apos;ve been working for 10 years now . and my goal for the next decade is to do it as easily as easily as to save the world , how it is to rescue food in <unk> ."
"and i have a plan for doing that . i want to convince you more human , including you all , spend more time with your more time and more <unk> playing <unk> ."
we currently spend three billion and a week on <unk> .
"some of you might think , &quot; that is a lot of time for play . &quot;"
maybe too much time when you think about how many problems we have in the real world <unk> .
"but in fact , from my exploration on the future for the future , it &apos;s exactly what the opposite is to be <unk> ."
three billion hours a week are not enough to solve the world &apos;s most <unk> problems .
"in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase these time <unk> ."
what i did is it &apos;s that the time the time it had over 21 and an <unk> <unk> week .
"so that &apos;s a little more <unk> to be , so i can <unk> this by being : if we &apos;re dealing problems with poverty , poverty , global warming , and we need to solve <unk> global and <unk> , i &apos;ve got to start working with at least online billion online billion dollars a week and at"
"no , i &apos;m really serious ."
"now , why ? this picture is quite interesting , what i think games are so essential to the living of the human species in a future . seriously ."
so this is a <unk> of photographers <unk> .
"so he wanted to <unk> the feelings in the play , so he &apos;d built on the <unk> a camera ."
"this is a <unk> , which is <unk> , as i do ."
"and if you don &apos;t have a <unk> , you might tell some of the most <unk> in this slide ."
"you probably see this <unk> for urgency about urgency , a fear , but even <unk> concentration , all of <unk> at a real issue of <unk> ."
"if you &apos;re playing , you &apos;ll see some kind of <unk> that are moving up there , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the surprise of surprise ."
this is a player who &apos;s at the <unk> of an so-called <unk> .
"oh , you know . ok . <unk> . and so we have a couple of members here ."
"a <unk> victory is a conclusion that &apos;s so powerful , that they didn &apos;t know it was possible for all of the time to do it ."
it was almost beyond imagination .
"and if you achieve it , you &apos;re more <unk> to that you are able to do so , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> ."
now this one <unk> in a <unk> victory .
"and this is what we have to see on millions of faces of <unk> across the world , if we take the <unk> of the next century , and the <unk> face of the <unk> <unk> <unk> to a <unk> player ."
"<unk> , unfortunately , we see this face in real lives of when we &apos;re getting to trouble with real problems ."
"i &apos;m in a <unk> , and i &apos;ve been &quot; <unk> &quot; -- &quot; and i actually have my face . and actually is it ? right ? ok ."
i &apos;m like i am &quot; in life &quot; i &apos;m <unk> . &quot;
"and here this is what some of the <unk> of my <unk> home in berkeley -- california , where i looked at my research in my 20s , who are better in play than i was in the real life ."
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we are not as well .
"and i mean , not only has ever successful even though this was from ."
"we &apos;re able to do more in <unk> . i mean to try to think about motivation , to do something that &apos;s being inspired <unk> to interact with each other ."
"when we &apos;re in a community , i think that many of us turn into our best version of all , and <unk> , at some point , we &apos;re <unk> to solve the problem , trying as long as it takes again to do again ."
"and in reality , if we &apos;re not <unk> if we &apos;re <unk> on obstacles often make us look different ."
"we feel overwhelmed . we feel extinct . we &apos;re suffering from being threatened , maybe depressed , <unk> ."
"these feelings have never , if we play games , they &apos;re just not in play ."
and this is what i wanted to <unk> .
"why is it impossible to do it in playing , do you not just can &apos;t do all of it ."
how can we take those feelings from play in the reality ?
so what i &apos;ve seen is i &apos;m the world of the world of art <unk> that <unk> the ideal environment for <unk> .
and i found out some things that will be able to do <unk> either as possible .
"so , first of all , when you take a <unk> into one of these games , especially in the world of <unk> , there &apos;s a bunch of different characters that are willing to come up with you , and that immediately is true ."
"but not just some mission , but an mission to fit in on their current level in play , right ?"
so you &apos;re going to do that .
never get one task that you cannot solve .
"and they &apos;re always at the end of their <unk> , so they need to be <unk> . but there are no <unk> in world ."
"you &apos;re <unk> around , and you &apos;re not <unk> , there are always a <unk> important thing to do ."
and they have <unk> employees .
"where they also go , hundreds of tens of thousands of people , working with them to <unk> their <unk> mission ."
"this is what we don &apos;t have that in real life just , that feeling that when you have an <unk> employees ready ."
"and also , there are this very <unk> story , which <unk> story , why we are there and we have to do what to do ."
then we get the whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve all heard about &quot; level up &quot; and &quot; <unk> and &quot; + &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; + intelligence &quot; is .
that feedback doesn &apos;t really live in the true place .
"now , if i leave the piece from , i have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> + <unk> <unk> a crazy idea ."
i &apos;m going to get it real life from this feedback .
"so , the problem of <unk> like world &apos;s <unk> is that it &apos;s as <unk> to at any point at a <unk> at any time , to be a moment that we expect to spend all our time in these classrooms ."
they &apos;re better than the reality .
all the world of <unk> <unk> millions have spent millions of years studying virtual issues of problems .
this isn &apos;t necessarily bad .
that might be <unk> .
"but to see the context in <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , our <unk> started to go to the <unk> <unk> ."
and so the very first <unk> <unk> .
"ok , so , if you talk about how much time we spend with games right now , that makes sense to make sense when you think of time in terms of the human development of development ."
"but it also makes it . it turns out that we &apos;re using this whole time on play , it actually changes what we &apos;re doing as humans are in their own ."
"we &apos;re developing to <unk> , and i &apos;m very much <unk> ."
that &apos;s the truth . i think about that .
"now you &apos;d look at this extraordinary statistics , recently , a study that the <unk> <unk> <unk> university was published : the average man , the average boy of 10 <unk> spend 10,000 hours with a <unk> of <unk> ."
"well , 10,000 hours , is an exciting thing that &apos;s for example ."
"in fact , for children in the united states , <unk> hours have <unk> time that they &apos;re in the school , from <unk> to high school , if they &apos;re not missing ."
"so we have a whole full of different <unk> , in which young people are learning what it means to be a good players to do like anything else they are learning in school ."
"and maybe a few of them came from followed the new book , malcolm , &quot; <unk> . &quot;"
"so you can see this theory of the <unk> , the theory of the <unk> of 10,000 hours ."
"it is based on the great research research that , by taking 10,000 hours with an <unk> of any kind of energy <unk> to the 21st to the 21st <unk> , we &apos;ll spend <unk> in there ."
and we &apos;ll be so good in what the <unk> man is about .
so what we have here is an entire new generation of young people who are <unk> .
"so the big question is , &quot; are what the players are doing right ? &quot;"
"because if we could figure that out , we &apos;d have never had the ability to have <unk> human potential ."
so that is how many people now in the world that have spent at least an hour a day with a <unk> rate .
these are our <unk> <unk> -- 500 million people being a &quot; an amazing thing . &quot;
and in the next decade we &apos;ve given another billion <unk> that are extraordinary in whatever .
"if you haven &apos;t heard this , you know ."
"<unk> <unk> developed energy systems that save energy and use it , rather than <unk> , so that players around the world , especially in india , can play in brazil , brazil ."
you &apos;d expect one more <unk> billion in the next decade .
so we &apos;ve got a <unk> billion <unk> .
"so , i started to get out of what it is to do what it &apos;s to make us play with these games ."
these are the four things i found -- first : <unk> .
"ok , imagine what it &apos;s like to do with the <unk> <unk> ."
"<unk> is the demand of doing something , <unk> and <unk> , with the belief , that we have an <unk> hope of success ."
"and the player always believe that an <unk> is possible <unk> , and that it &apos;s only a part of try to try to try and <unk> it ."
<unk> aren &apos;t sitting around .
play <unk> are <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
"so there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that we show that that people have a lot more , after we played with them , even if they &apos;ve gotten <unk> <unk> ."
and the reason is that it requires a lot of trust to play with somebody as a game .
we believe that someone &apos;s time having their own time is that the rules will be <unk> to that the same purpose we &apos;ve had to be able to keep ourselves in <unk> and down the end .
"so the <unk> system is growing by <unk> , confidence and one ."
"as a result , we &apos;re making stronger social relationships with each other ."
<unk> <unk> : fantastic .
"you know , there is an reason why the <unk> of <unk> cost is <unk> , like <unk> , kind of like a <unk> week ."
"the reason is that when we are playing together we &apos;re actually actually <unk> to work , as if we &apos;re <unk> or not doing something ."
"we know that we work as human beings , when we &apos;re doing hard , the <unk> work done ."
and player are always ready to work hard if they get the real job .
"and finally , <unk> meaning ."
and the player love being to become part of the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s missions .
"here &apos;s an information that is true to the right side for the lights ; it certainly knows all wikipedia , the largest <unk> of the world ."
"the world <unk> world , with almost <unk> <unk> of <unk> , is the world of <unk> ."
there is about five million people using it every month .
they &apos;re giving more information about world of <unk> as a result in each other <unk> around the world .
and they create a <unk> story .
they created an essential source of knowledge about the world of <unk> .
"okay , so these are four <unk> that come to one outcome . players are the <unk> , <unk> individuals ."
it &apos;s people who believe that they can be change as a single world .
and the only problem is they think that they can change the virtual worlds but not the real .
this is the problem i try to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
he was great . he &apos;s studied why people spend so much time and time to spend money on <unk> .
"so he says , &quot; we are won &apos;t be <unk> from less than a <unk> in the virtual worlds . &quot;"
and it &apos;s done by an economist . so it &apos;s <unk> .
and he says ...
"not like me -- i &apos;m <unk> games , i &apos;m a little bit more <unk> ."
"so he &apos;s saying that makes sense , because players can reach more than real life ."
"they can play stronger more and higher complex social <unk> than in real life , they get more <unk> and more efficient at play in the real life ."
"so , he says , it &apos;s completely <unk> to us , that players spend more time in virtual world than in really real ."
"i first agree , which &apos;s kind of a <unk> ."
but it &apos;s definitely not an <unk> .
we need to start to <unk> the real world in a game .
and my inspiration comes from an event that <unk> years .
"there is these <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> , you know ?"
before that <unk> <unk> was <unk> .
and that was actually the first <unk> of people developed .
"and when you talk about the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , you may know that story , and how and how play is <unk> ."
"<unk> <unk> are a <unk> , in the kingdom , invented the <unk> as a <unk> ."
it was said to be a big <unk> that the king of king <unk> decided to have this crazy idea .
people <unk> . people <unk> .
it was a very popular situation . it took a really <unk> solution .
"so they were invented to be <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and a more effective strategy . in one day , you would eat . you &apos;ll play ."
"and they would be so much in the <unk> <unk> because there are <unk> , and playing with <unk> , <unk> <unk> , that they would forget it to eat nothing ."
"and then the next day you would play , and on the next day , you &apos;d eat food ."
"and according to <unk> , they were <unk> that for 18 years using this <unk> by playing one day and the next ."
"and as that , i think , we have a games today ."
we &apos;re <unk> to play the suffering from the real world .
"we &apos;re putting in numbers , to try to get rid of all the things that doesn &apos;t work in real world , everything that is really <unk> in real life , and we &apos;re going to take out what we need ."
but it doesn &apos;t have to be that at the end .
it &apos;s the <unk> .
"after 18 years old , the <unk> was not better for <unk> , so the king decided , an <unk> <unk> ."
they shared the kingdom in two <unk> .
they played a science center and the one thing could do to have been a <unk> adventure .
they left <unk> and they were making a new way for a new <unk> . they just were going to take many people back in their survival and to survive <unk> to the rest of a <unk> that they had done with .
"that sounds crazy , right ?"
"but <unk> <unk> show that the <unk> that the <unk> <unk> and the same dna <unk> , the same dna <unk> <unk> ."
"so scientists came to talk about the <unk> of <unk> , that actually is a crazy thing ."
and <unk> found evidence from this global <unk> that took almost 20 years and <unk> the <unk> .
so this is a crazy story .
"so maybe they actually have rescued through their people using games to <unk> for 18 years of games , and then <unk> these <unk> -- and they were so much more about the play of their whole civilization , they &apos;ve had taken this entire civilization ."
"so , we can ."
we have been play since 1994 .
so this was the first real <unk> in the world of <unk> . this was 16 years ago .
"they &apos;ve been <unk> for 18 years , we &apos;ve got over 16 years ."
i would suggest that we &apos;re willing to play our own play game game .
"so , they sent half the civilization to the search for a new world . therefore i take my 21 billion a week ."
"we should say in the fact that half of us , we have to spend one hour of games a day to play , until we have solved issues of the real world ."
"so i know you &apos;ll ask : &quot; how do we solve the real world in play , &quot; and that question , i &apos;ve got my job at the last decade on the <unk> for the future ."
"and so we put this <unk> in our office in the <unk> system , and <unk> it out of how to make it to be ."
we don &apos;t want to try and tell the future earlier .
what we want we to create is a world .
we want to imagine the possible outcome . and then people <unk> this notion of the reality .
we &apos;re looking for <unk> won and give people the possibilities that they reach .
i &apos;m going to show you just three games i designed to try to give some people <unk> <unk> win in your future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it is a <unk> where you need to overcome <unk> .
"so the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> to do it for you as a real life , so when you &apos;re in a game , if you <unk> to the game , they are to where they &apos;re better and <unk> it &apos;s real , and you &apos;re <unk> in life , and then they"
"we did a play with <unk> <unk> <unk> in 2007 , and we covered it for over the last three years ."
"and i can tell you , it was a <unk> experience ."
"nobody &apos;s going to change his lives , because it &apos;s good for the environment , or that we should ."
"but when you &apos;re in an entire adventure and you &apos;re told , we &apos;re going to go from oil ."
that &apos;s a great adventure that you &apos;re doing this .
find out how they were going . most of our players are <unk> the game at <unk> their game .
so we have a bigger game for the next game that will get a greater <unk> to the most vulnerable <unk> than just a point of <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed the game for the heart <unk> .
so <unk> is the <unk> of a <unk> that people have just given 23 years on the planet .
"this is a global <unk> <unk> , which is , of course , of course ."
"the <unk> with a <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;ve <unk> a &quot; <unk> <unk> ."
"they &apos;re known <unk> where the &quot; the &quot; <unk> &quot; is &quot; -- you &apos;ve taken the astronauts the <unk> , and the only in the world can save the world ."
"but in our play , by just five people , we say , everyone was in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our task , the future to use energy , health , for the health of creating <unk> , and the future of justice ."
"8,000 players had played the game for eight weeks ."
"they found 500 creative solutions that <unk> them , if they were to , they were <unk> ."
"and the same game we get out in march , and this is a game in collaboration with the world ."
"when you finish the game , they get from the world world bank &apos;s <unk> , &quot; the world &apos;s world &apos;s dilemma system ."
"we are working on sub-saharan africa , and store them learning a <unk> social <unk> ."
"we have a <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ve got a level high to understand <unk> and sustainability , about <unk> , vision and <unk> ."
"i want to invite you all , to share this game with young people everywhere , all around the world , especially in <unk> , that benefit from each of them , to come together and save the world ."
i &apos;m going to the end .
i want to ask you something .
so what do you think that is going to happen ?
"so , we have all these <unk> player , we have play games that show us what to do , but we &apos;re still not saving the world ."
"well , i &apos;m hoping that at that a point of the time you &apos;re the players who can <unk> to work on our work , that games have a big significance to change ."
"we &apos;ve all had all this <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the capacity to get <unk> social <unk> , <unk> and <unk> the meaning of <unk> ."
"and i really hope that we have major games to survive on this planet , to survive another century ."
"and i hope you &apos;ll play with like this , you can play and play ."
"and if i come into the next decade , i &apos;m sure that i could make two things we can create each <unk> , and that we can play all kinds of play ."
"so let me say , let &apos;s play the <unk> games !"
thank you .
i would like to tell you a bit what happened to write a couple of months ago about writing an article on <unk> .
"i &apos;ve always done my <unk> , and i was done with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i noticed that i have never looked in my life in my life , and i &apos;ve really <unk> the word , &quot; the word really means ."
i read you about the post .
"&quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , useless , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , controlled , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> ,"
"<unk> : good , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;"
"i read this list from a young friend to read , and she felt <unk> , but i just came back to &quot; <unk> , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t read to reading , and stop reading <unk> and <unk> to the emotional shock and <unk> by this shock ."
"of course , this was an <unk> , old <unk> <unk> : i &apos;ve just thought it &apos;s a <unk> ."
"but in fact , it &apos;s a issue on the early 1980s , and when i was starting with the elementary school and that when i started building my own <unk> outside the world in a way , there were other children around me and around the world ."
and god is thank you at the time i &apos;m not using any <unk> .
"and i &apos;d go out this seriously , in a world i would be born as somebody like me as a person who are able to have a living <unk> in <unk> . but today i will be an adventure and for the consequences that i &apos;ve seen ."
"so i immediately got the <unk> <unk> of 2009 , and i would expect to be a <unk> piece ."
here is the hallucinations of this <unk> device .
<unk> is not that better .
"in particular , the last two words under <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; good &quot; . &quot;"
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it is about what we think about the people we describe with the <unk> .
"it &apos;s the <unk> that are in these words , and how we <unk> these values ."
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and people are looking around us .
"many more often <unk> , including the <unk> and <unk> , really believed that the most <unk> of a <unk> has got a large force because what you can do to do in a way you can do with <unk> ."
"so , what do we actually want <unk> -- a <unk> person or an <unk> human beings ?"
"in fact , a human beings have known as the child , could have enough to <unk> them and share them <unk> ."
wouldn &apos;t it be a nice deal to open doors ?
"a person who opened me all the doors to the doors was my <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> in <unk> ."
"he &apos;s called the <unk> <unk> . he <unk> , whose name is how to think the most american americans can &apos;t be <unk> -- so he &apos;s always known as dr. <unk> ."
and dr. <unk> had always <unk> fly very <unk> and was made for the work with children just as well .
"and i found the time i spent in this hospital a little bit , just -- until the <unk> <unk> ."
"i needed to do a single <unk> <unk> often with these <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- in various colors -- you know what i &apos;ve got to do about my <unk> , and i &apos;ve got those <unk> over <unk> as anything i do . i <unk> them ."
"and imagine you &apos;re actually having an <unk> kid with dr. <unk> <unk> , trying to stop those who have the <unk> with no success ."
"and he &apos;d looked at a second one of my <unk> , which were these <unk> , and they were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he told me , &quot; wow , you &apos;re such a <unk> <unk> , a young girl and a <unk> girl , you &apos;ll get a <unk> ."
"and if you put it into , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;"
"and that was just one more simple trick from dr. <unk> , so i was doing the <unk> that i didn &apos;t want to do with the view that <unk> <unk> girls in the second <unk> of the second day . but he was actually put my head into my <unk> ."
"and i ask myself today , like , as a very much of my vision for me as a <unk> and <unk> young young , and i could imagine myself as <unk> from an <unk> of very strong , <unk> and <unk> <unk> human ."
"this is just an example of many , as adult as adults , who can <unk> the imagination as a child ."
"but as we already have the most <unk> examples of the <unk> , let us give us a space to imagine what we all want to have : to have each one of us , to see each one <unk> as a single person ."
our language <unk> the social changes that are caused by the amount of technological change in many cases .
"so from the medical standpoint of what you &apos;re looking at , of course , that my legs , which <unk> <unk> from titan , from titan , and <unk> <unk> into how they allow people to actually <unk> , to turn them on and <unk> the circuits , the circuits , and <unk> on the social constraints of"
"so maybe that technological change <unk> has <unk> because the fact that there were a different fact that anyone , that every other human society can do something very <unk> and very <unk> , and that humanity is the ability to <unk> our biggest <unk> , our greatest system ."
"the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s a real story , because people are asking me to tell me about how i &apos;m with <unk> , and i &apos;ll tell you a little : this one of those sentence for me that i never felt really , and i &apos;m just really , and i kept always felt"
"this phrase from <unk> , with an idea of the idea , that success , or happiness depends on it , is going to <unk> an challenge , without <unk> by being inspired . when my life would be so successful or my <unk> , i would be able to get in the experience of living , as a"
"but the truth is that we are changing . of course , of course we &apos;ve created the challenge , of whether it doesn &apos;t matter , or even in fact , both of them , or are ."
and i &apos;m saying that that this is good .
<unk> are not an <unk> we need to <unk> to get much better .
<unk> are simply in our own lives .
and i tend to <unk> out as my <unk> .
"sometimes i &apos;m suggesting that he &apos;s really <unk> , and sometimes it &apos;s barely too seen , but it &apos;s all me in the way ."
"and i want to make a sense of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> of people ."
"you &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> and challenges , which are only the most <unk> of life , and each person is doing so differently , but the question is not , is , not where we can <unk> or not how do it wrong ."
"so we are not only responsible to <unk> out of the people that we love to protect , but to do it , to make sure , well , to come up ."
and we don &apos;t like our children if we get the sense they can &apos;t adapt .
"you need to separate things , which is to be the <unk> , to be <unk> and the other <unk> , to be there , whether i was <unk> or not ."
"and to be honest , the only <unk> and the <unk> that i &apos;ve got to leave is that the world is constantly <unk> of saying it was to describe me with these of definitions ."
"in our desire to protect people who are on the heart of hearts and the <unk> , difficult reality about their <unk> or even <unk> to the <unk> of quality of life on the life that we need to be told that we don &apos;t believe in <unk> that we don &apos;t <unk> the <unk> ."
"maybe this is a <unk> concept , which is only to make up on a <unk> , and as we can fix this , for every single <unk> as one <unk> <unk> in it ."
"if we don &apos;t treat a human being able , and not in all of their forces , and <unk> , we can get to the natural rise of the natural battle that maybe they need to have to lead another disease ."
"we &apos;ve got an human <unk> , which is worth in society ."
"so we have to look around the world , and focus on all the <unk> of the human possibilities ."
"but at the <unk> , that it &apos;s between the perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> , the connection ."
"we should not <unk> these important days of our body <unk> or <unk> , we shouldn &apos;t try to prevent them , neither should be <unk> by these <unk> , but it &apos;s about finding the most <unk> opportunity ."
"i may be , to realize that , that we need to not have an <unk> <unk> , but we &apos;re going to make them open to <unk> they &apos;re also a <unk> to <unk> to <unk> a <unk> and possibly even dancing to it with them ."
"and perhaps we can do that , as if <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and useful and feel so much as <unk> , by the time it does not so much longer ."
"in this year we &apos;ve <unk> the 200 , and by darwin , darwin and when he has written 150 years ago on evolution in evolution , darwin &apos;s eyes on a really the real <unk> of human <unk> ."
"and it would <unk> it like that , not the <unk> of its kind , and not the <unk> of his sort of act of , but the one that can <unk> to the best change ."
there &apos;s a <unk> of creativity .
"it &apos;s not just by darwin &apos;s work knowledge that the ability to survive the skill of human beings , to survive , to the head of the <unk> , is to become <unk> through conflicts , <unk> ."
"so again , change and <unk> are the most <unk> capacity of the human <unk> ."
and maybe we just know what we &apos;re more <unk> when we get to be really a <unk> .
"maybe the same thing that &apos;s the sense of <unk> , which is i think is , it &apos;s a feeling like our own force ."
we can give you some <unk> .
we can give <unk> to a new meaning that goes beyond time .
maybe we can see <unk> as change .
<unk> are for a change that we have to have to <unk> .
i think the biggest damage that we have <unk> ourselves is to believe that we need to be normal .
and even <unk> -- who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
"it &apos;s a <unk> . the conventional . but you won &apos;t the normal . and you would really know those poor person , you really want to know , if you really had it ?"
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s not .
"this is great if we could <unk> that paradigm of <unk> against another person or strength to even make it a slightly more dangerous to <unk> , so we could be able to engage the forces of very many children , and then they were <unk> their <unk> ."
what <unk> found is that we have the members of our society always have a <unk> : how to be useful to make a contribution .
"it &apos;s evidence that the <unk> people have <unk> people , and people have <unk> to physical <unk> with physical <unk> , and perhaps , in the process of getting to the <unk> of this society was a huge amount of valuable ."
"they didn &apos;t take these people and <unk> , and <unk> them ; they were treated for something interesting and <unk> ."
a few years ago i went to the city in which i grew up in a space called &quot; <unk> in this <unk> of <unk> <unk> &quot; and i was in front of a tomato tomato .
"it was summer , and i had <unk> ."
"and i hear a guy coming up behind me , &quot; well , if you &apos;re not aimee <unk> . &quot;"
"and i was <unk> about this <unk> and the older man , and i had no idea if he was ."
"and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , do we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;"
"and he said , &quot; well , they &apos;re not very remember ."
"when i first watched her she , i &apos;d <unk> her <unk> from her mother ."
"&quot; oh , you know ."
"and of course , it made the most important thing ."
"this was dr. <unk> , a man i knew only about my mother &apos;s mother , because of course i , in fact , i was <unk> in my birthday to two weeks ."
"the doctor &apos;s physician for <unk> <unk> my mother was in national and so my parents had the man who brought me to the world , didn &apos;t even ."
"and , because i was born without being <unk> , and my feet <unk> , and i just had a few toes on this and a few <unk> of the other hand on it and was the <unk> , that was the <unk> of the bad news ."
"and he told me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk and never be that <unk> of , like other children , never that you might never have an independent life , and then they &apos;re just <unk> me ."
"really extraordinary , i found that he was <unk> by my <unk> childhood , whether i had won a <unk> in the second grade when i was in <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> with a <unk> of student , or he <unk> when my president to her farmer , and he was my doctor , he had my"
and he &apos;s called this part of his <unk> factor for the invention of human <unk> .
and you can &apos;t do so far enough to be critical to what the factor of a person can be .
"and dr. <unk> told that he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that children , if they don &apos;t get anything else , and even if you get a little bit of support , once kids can achieve a lot , you can get much <unk> ."
"look , dr. <unk> have changed its own thinking ."
"he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how to <unk> it with two different things ."
"and i &apos;ve also changed my thinking about the age of time when you asked me for 15 years , if i &apos;d been <unk> my <unk> with legs from meat and bones , i &apos;d not have a second ."
so i really <unk> to do normal time .
"if you ask myself this , i &apos;m not as sure ."
"and that &apos;s what happened , because i <unk> with my legs and did not , with these guys , in <unk> ."
"and perhaps this change could be happening because i &apos;ve been <unk> so many people that have opened the door to me , rather instead of having people that i wanted to live or have <unk> for me to do a notion ."
"you see , it actually takes only one human being , to tell you how you can be able to get your forces out , and you &apos;re through ."
"if you can make somebody , your own , your <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and for somebody at the moment , they &apos;re open to your door a very good answer ."
so they bring them up and they can open the doors .
the real importance of the word <unk> &quot; <unk> in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
"it is , <unk> something that is in one , the potential <unk> ."
"again , what potential would we like is <unk> ?"
"in <unk> , in the u.k. in britain , an case accident did , <unk> was taken into <unk> ."
"they call that &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in america , &quot; we call it as &quot; <unk> . &quot;"
student <unk> <unk> .
"and the one who <unk> a <unk> to <unk> <unk> , getting the better teachers , etc ."
"and we &apos;ve had <unk> <unk> <unk> students with one &quot; <unk> &quot; the note &quot; for a very good thing . &quot; you got said to be <unk> that they were very , very , and after those three months , they have written by those two ."
"and of course , it <unk> you to listen to the heart that <unk> was told , &quot; it was <unk> , &quot; it &apos;s enough <unk> ."
"and as it was , after the three months of the time ."
but just those who have been still in school -- except from our students who had gotten the school .
"in the very important to this study , that teachers were no <unk> ."
the teachers did not know it was going to be changed .
they just said that there &apos;s been some <unk> and that they &apos;re <unk> to be <unk> with the grade -- and they have something like it &apos;s taught and they were treated .
"the only real <unk> <unk> is a hole that &apos;s broken to have no hope to have anymore . it doesn &apos;t find more <unk> on our natural , our <unk> , more powerful , <unk> and our skill <unk> capacity of <unk> ."
"if we do that , we create the human mind with being , to have hope for ourselves , to come to be <unk> around and find others around them to find <unk> , to be a positive part of us really positive ."
"if there is a mind of all this qualities of it , we can create a new reality and new <unk> ."
"i would like to end with a poem that has been <unk> by a <unk> in this century <unk> to talk by my friend <unk> . and the poem is saying to god &quot; the god , &quot; he never know her four : &quot; every child . &quot; &quot;"
"come , dance with me . thank you very much ."
what would they like better than they are at right now ?
"now let me think about how very little changes of your genes , a better <unk> could have a better -- more and more , complicated ."
"or do they want the <unk> , stronger , more force ."
how much do you want to be <unk> and <unk> ?
so what about living in good health ?
but maybe they are one who is more and <unk> after all of them .
which one would <unk> them ?
"which would you like to have , if you could just have one ?"
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
some . probably the way that much of the people are <unk> here .
this is a very good one .
how many would be <unk> for a good <unk> ?
there are a few more .
how about how about <unk> <unk> ?
some less <unk> .
what is longevity ?
"ah , all of the majority . i &apos;m happy to <unk> the physician ."
"if you were only one person to have , it was a whole different world ."
is all this <unk> up ?
or is it possible ?
"evolution is a <unk> subject on the <unk> , but i would like to give you a picture of <unk> to you ."
"the big <unk> in the twentieth century , <unk> , who also was a <unk> at the russian <unk> , wrote a paper called &quot; nothing for biology is not the point in the <unk> of evolution . &quot;"
"so when you are one of these are not for the proof of evolution : this would be a very good place to <unk> your <unk> , to give you their personal <unk> , and maybe , you can tell the <unk> , on a picture and perhaps , and perhaps <unk> ."
"and so if you accept evolution , consider the fact that they do , is it just beyond the past , right ?"
is it for different <unk> <unk> <unk> or is it about it ?
this is another view from life of life .
"so here in the image , i put an image in a center of the air in all directions because if you look back at the <unk> of life , all existing <unk> on top <unk> <unk> on these <unk> , <unk> has been able ; she was able to survive ; she had their own success ; they"
"this part of this <unk> , far from the end , of course , this is what we &apos;re interested in most of ."
we <unk> <unk> about <unk> chimps from a <unk> of about six or eight million years ago .
"this time , maybe 20 different <unk> of <unk> , perhaps ."
and some of these have come and left .
we have been here for <unk> years .
"it turns out , though , we are right now more <unk> of the other parts of the life , but really , in the largest portion , are the most fundamental <unk> that we are in a place in the same place ."
"so you realize we can use this , and we can <unk> the <unk> of a common framework of <unk> to produce the protein of the human <unk> of the <unk> that used to treat the <unk> ?"
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same proteins that &apos;s <unk> <unk> by what &apos;s coming from the <unk> .
"and we already talk about bacteria about bacteria , is that every one of us in our gut <unk> is more bacteria than we can do in the rest of our body ?"
maybe 10 times more <unk> .
"so i mean , guess when <unk> <unk> asked , about your <unk> , think , do you think about bacteria ?"
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for that bacteria .
"it &apos;s warm ; it &apos;s dark ; it &apos;s it <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> ."
and they all get in their business that they could just be <unk> for a long time .
it &apos;s really a easier way of bacteria with <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
"but they are , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they have to be interested in their lives ."
they help out of <unk> of <unk> . and they protect them against certain kinds of <unk> .
but what is going to come into the future ?
are we in such a kind of <unk> culture of a species ?
or is we &apos;re <unk> to something else -- something that might actually <unk> the environment ?
"now let &apos;s take the one step back at 14 years ago -- the world &apos;s earth , the solar system , about a half billion years ago -- the first <unk> of creatures , may be three and four years ago , on earth &apos;s world as far as much as a world &apos;s next three , and"
"this vast great symphony of the universe , this is the life on the ground only <unk> to just <unk> ; the animal kingdom , like an individual <unk> ; and human life , is a <unk> <unk> ."
we were .
"and also , this is an <unk> <unk> of this talk , and that &apos;s why i hope d <unk> you ."
"well when i was a <unk> <unk> in college , i had my first <unk> ."
so i &apos;m fascinated by elegance of elegance and beauty .
"i &apos;m <unk> to the force of evolution , and i found something very <unk> : the most of life living in <unk> organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information in two and <unk> ."
"however , when there was time in the <unk> <unk> of organisms , things began to change things ."
sexual sexual <unk> begins in a picture .
"and the very important thing is that with the <unk> of the <unk> , the genome will <unk> the rest of the body <unk> ."
"so , in fact , you could say that the <unk> of the body is in the evolution of our body as a moment , as the sexual <unk> ."
"now i must <unk> when i was a <unk> , and i thought that i was , &quot; sex , sex / death , death , death for you -- it seemed pretty <unk> to the time in which for each year , it &apos;s going to be more <unk> ."
"i &apos;ve been to understanding the feelings of george <unk> that were reading in <unk> , in the &apos; 90s , back to <unk> its show ."
"and one night , there &apos;s a <unk> in its <unk> ."
he &apos;s opening the door .
and he &apos;s a beautiful <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
"and she looks at it , and she says , &quot; i am for <unk> . &quot;"
"&quot; that &apos;s beautiful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;ll have to take the soup . &quot;"
"i came up to the insight as a doctor , that i was in <unk> to be different than the goal of evolution -- not <unk> but in different ways ."
i &apos;ve tried and preserve the body .
i wanted to keep you healthy .
so i wanted to do it for the health of a <unk> .
i wanted we to live a long and to live a long time .
"evolution is all over <unk> &apos;s genome of the next generation , adaptation to the generation , and survival ."
"from an <unk> point , they are out , and i designed <unk> <unk> to put the standard <unk> in the next level of <unk> to send in the sea to the oceans ."
"i think we would all have a <unk> , all the <unk> that would bring all to the term than he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to <unk> through my work ."
i want to do by not getting a <unk> . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t really mean <unk> of life .
"it doesn &apos;t <unk> the largest <unk> , and the <unk> , the fastest , and it wasn &apos;t once the <unk> ."
"evolution <unk> the creatures , the <unk> in the best ."
"it &apos;s only the test that it &apos;s <unk> , success , and success ."
"there are bacteria on the ocean where the <unk> are , and it &apos;s the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> out that there if the fish would be there , the fish would have made it for a <unk> environment , they &apos;ve made it to make an <unk> environment ."
"so what this means is , when we look back into what &apos;s happened in evolution and , as we think about the space of the evolution in evolution , and particularly , as we <unk> in the next stage , i would say , that a number of ways ."
the first one is that we won &apos;t go into .
we have <unk> <unk> .
"and the reason it would be , first of all , was to have us , we managed to get a lot of genes of genes that could have been <unk> , and from the population ."
"and secondly , as a species , we have a different species so that we <unk> that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to us just as we can adjust them ."
"by the way , we <unk> and <unk> around , and we can never tell them to say that it &apos;s been <unk> needed to <unk> , for evolution to go back ."
"a second opportunity is , it &apos;ll be the traditional way of traditional ways -- of course , by <unk> forces of nature ."
"and the argument here would be that the wheels of the solar wheels were slow , but they &apos;re <unk> out ."
"and so far the <unk> is , if we <unk> as a species of planets , there are <unk> and <unk> , the change in the environment that <unk> in the <unk> could produce as natural as much as the way it could ."
"but there &apos;s one third way in <unk> , a <unk> , amazing possibility ."
"i call it <unk> -- the new development not just the very simple , but led to , and decided to make ourselves a better <unk> to what we are doing ."
"now , how could that happen ?"
how could it be possible to make this ?
"let &apos;s take a look at reality that people are now doing decisions in some cultures , they make decisions about their offspring ."
"they have , in certain cultures , choice , to have more than women ."
"it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the person and the government are ."
"you know if you can &apos;t only be able to vote in terms of their child &apos;s <unk> , but they also could <unk> for the genetic <unk> , the diseases of <unk> and to <unk> ."
and what if you could make the genetic changes to <unk> diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or the <unk> or the <unk> of the brain to <unk> ?
would they not want to make those changes inside their genes ?
"if we <unk> , these kinds of changes are getting increasingly to ."
the <unk> genome started a year and it took 13 years .
it cost by <unk> billion dollars .
"and then , by doing that time , in 2004 , you could do the same for 20 million dollars in a way , as four months ."
"today you can have one sequence of three billion <unk> of the human genome for about 20,000 dollars and into the space of a week , from one week ."
"it will be a long time by the reality of being the worth of a $ 1,000 genomes in human genome , and there is increasingly being available in any other way ."
"one week of the national institute in the national academy of <unk> , francis for francis <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , two researchers , the <unk> of natural evolution led to working at <unk> <unk> <unk> into the <unk> process of <unk> and <unk> <unk> into a <unk> ."
"a couple of years ago , the <unk> <unk> , the scientist , was given the <unk> to the research center where he took a <unk> , and by the <unk> of the manipulation of only four genes to get them to a cell <unk> , to <unk> cell <unk> , a cell cell cell phone cell , a"
these changes are in the <unk> .
"the same technology that &apos;s produced the human insulin in bacteria is <unk> that are simply <unk> , not just against ourselves , but the yet by the other viruses to be created by the other viruses ."
"whether you think it or not , this is a <unk> trial on vaccine <unk> <unk> that has been <unk> in the cells ."
can you imagine a good picture coming out of <unk> ?
"that &apos;s a lot of reality today and in your future , that &apos;s going to be much more possible ."
"so , just imagine two different changes ."
"you can change the cells in your body , but what if you were the cells of your body that would change ?"
"which would be like to get their <unk> and to change the <unk> egg <unk> <unk> , to make their children better chance better to live a better chance -- from diabetes , the risk of <unk> cancer , the risk of cancer ?"
who does not want to have any children ?
"and then the <unk> , the same engine of science that allows the changes to <unk> disease , might we allow ourselves to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- better memory ."
"why did not grow the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , mostly if you can extend it to the next generation ?"
"why not have the fast <unk> <unk> that will allow them to do , <unk> and longer ?"
why no longer life ?
those <unk> will be .
"and when we &apos;re in a place where we can <unk> it to the next generation of , and we can <unk> the <unk> that we want , we want to be transformed by evolution ."
"we &apos;ll have an process that perhaps have a single need for average 50 years , and we can take it for thousands of years and maybe maybe even the next 100 years ."
"those are decisions of their grandchildren , or their <unk> , are needed to deal with them ."
"we &apos;ll use those choices to shape a society which is better , which is <unk> , that is <unk> ?"
"or are we going to choose <unk> different types of food that we want to be for some of you , and don &apos;t we care for others ?"
"are we going to form a society and become <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> ?"
these are the species that we have to see from questions .
"and at the <unk> of everybody , we &apos;ll never be able to develop the wisdom of us and the wisdom of that we need for that decisions ."
"good as the <unk> , and <unk> to think , maybe as you might be able to be a choice to us ."
thank you .
"i want you to imagine that you &apos;re going to be able to take a <unk> robot you have to have the ability that will help you , or another who helps it to get back and go back ."
we are calling up at mit <unk> &apos;s robot .
and you &apos;re not anything else that you put them in the morning and the <unk> them and the rate is <unk> and you help them keep you going to keep doing your balance .
and this is indeed the true <unk> of human and machine .
but not only that -- and <unk> together with the universe and others out there .
and this is not simply a <unk> idea .
"so now to show you the things that we &apos;re working , we &apos;re going to begin to talk about american soldiers who <unk> over 100 pounds on his backs on the back , and it &apos;s the demand for them to carry on ."
"now of course , that leads to some of the important complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- <unk> <unk> ."
"so we thought we could <unk> this , and we could make a <unk> that would help to deal with this problem , in this problem ."
so let me just tell you now <unk> -- <unk> the <unk> universal universal .
"<unk> : with the <unk> i can carry 200 pounds on a terrain in the context of that place , many hours ."
"his <unk> design allows it to <unk> deep , to the stable and highly effective movements ."
"it felt i would take where i want to take and then increase my <unk> , and then <unk> ."
"we &apos;re <unk> to <unk> this device with the <unk> , this new <unk> device in the year ."
and that &apos;s true .
"so let &apos;s look at our <unk> now , something that i &apos;m particularly interested in <unk> <unk> ."
there are <unk> million people sitting <unk> in the world .
that &apos;s about a percent percent of the <unk> .
"and that &apos;s actually <unk> , <unk> ."
"we &apos;re now talking to a lot about very young people in <unk> &apos;s life in the <unk> &apos; 60s of life -- <unk> , <unk> -- from the fate of your <unk> were <unk> and the option is the one option ."
"but it goes to be the most <unk> , whose number is <unk> ."
"and so quite a simple option -- if there &apos;s a mechanism , or by other , you know , a wheelchair is a wheelchair ."
"and so it &apos;s been over the way that i have to say it &apos;s been , very , very popular , for instance ."
and so we thought we could start writing a whole new story in mobility .
"so let me introduce you to <unk> that is <unk> by <unk> , which suffered by 19 years ago , who had a <unk> that had no longer going on the results since 19 years , and now ."
thank you .
"as i said , <unk> <unk> our <unk> ."
so it has sensors .
"his entirely <unk> sensors in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> to our back , which is on her back ."
"and these are <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s sitting at their <unk> , as well as it is on their <unk> , and they move forward in quite a <unk> and very natural <unk> ."
and i was 24 years old and in <unk> when a <unk> <unk> was <unk> to feel <unk> .
"so i lost every second , i lost every feeling and every motion under my <unk> ."
"it wasn &apos;t long after that time a doctor in my <unk> and said to be , &quot; <unk> , they &apos;re never going to be able to go to walk . &quot;"
and that was 19 years ago .
he <unk> every steel hope from my mind .
"and in fact , <unk> and technologies from <unk> had to learn to drive again and <unk> them and to drive the hands ."
i didn &apos;t have been invented to go back and now .
thank you .
"as you can see that , we have the technology we &apos;ve got , to address all the platforms and discuss with them ."
"it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential for going to change the whole of future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for <unk> here , and all of the <unk> , but for all of them ."
thank you .
"at home at new york , i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> of this <unk> organization called <unk> ."
"if i don &apos;t <unk> poverty , i went off as <unk> from a <unk> with <unk> of the fire ."
"well , in our city , in the volunteer an <unk> <unk> , you have to be pretty early on in the <unk> to get a place to be <unk> ."
i remember the first time to fire .
"i was the second <unk> of volunteers , so i had a really good chance in this ."
but it was still a <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to get the rest of the food community and to figure out what our tasks were .
"and by <unk> the one of the <unk> , he had to just a very <unk> conversation with the <unk> , which was probably one of the most <unk> of their lives ."
"it was in the middle of the night and she stood in the middle of a walk under a screen and a walk out in the <unk> <unk> during her house in the <unk> , as she was on the house ."
"the other volunteers , who was just about to give me a <unk> -- let &apos;s call it the <unk> of martin -- <unk> first , was asked to go to that house and to save the dog &apos;s <unk> ."
the dog ! i was <unk> about your mind .
"there was a lawyer or some lawyer , which , now , for the rest of its life , could tell the people that he went into a <unk> house to save a living room , just because it was five seconds ."
"now , i got the next ."
the <unk> <unk> me .
"he says to , &quot; <unk> , you have into the house ."
"you &apos;ve got to go up and go over , and this woman will take a pair of shoes . &quot;"
and i <unk> .
"now , not exactly what i had <unk> , but i went back to the hallway , up in <unk> along the &quot; real &quot; war &quot; <unk> &quot; to that point at this time were already taken to be in front of a couple of <unk> ."
"and now , i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero ."
i wear my prey back down to where i met my <unk> and i met the <unk> dog .
"and we <unk> our guess out of <unk> , where no surprise that , it got more attention when i was much more attention than i am ."
"some weeks later , the letter got a letter <unk> , where they <unk> for the too brave and so forth ."
so one of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> described that you had even brought your shoes .
"and in my own work , <unk> <unk> and <unk> in my <unk> as a <unk> , i was a <unk> of generosity and kindness from a great scale , but i also see the <unk> and the <unk> of individual ."
and you know what i learned from that one ?
they &apos;re all important .
"so if i go around this space and people who have either been a very successful success or have ever reached there on your way and i want to give the <unk> , don &apos;t wait for that <unk> ."
and they &apos;re not waiting for a difference in life to make one difference until they &apos;ve reached their initial million .
"if they have something to do , they give ."
"use them into a <unk> , <unk> a park in the neighborhood ."
be some of your <unk> .
"no day we will give a chance to save a human life , but each day gives us the possibility of a change ."
so let it go . save your shoes .
thank you .
"<unk> <unk> : mark , mark , come back ."
thank you very much .
i just come from a community who knows the secret to mankind &apos;s <unk> .
"a place where the <unk> will lead the <unk> , to have sex &apos; <unk> &quot; <unk> , and the game that &apos;s <unk> -- where fun is a real serious resource ."
"and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco ."
"ladies and gentlemen , her <unk> ."
this is the world of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of congo .
<unk> <unk> our next living life with chimpanzees .
"that means we &apos;ve got an common <unk> , an evolutionary grandmother that lived on about six million years ago ."
well chimpanzees have been familiar to their homes in the ground .
"but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> <unk> , of the story of human evolution ."
"but in <unk> , the other side is the <unk> <unk> ."
"whereas chimps are <unk> , in large <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> female are being led by women ."
they &apos;ve really had what <unk> is because this leads to the <unk> <unk> society in the <unk> of force has not been shown yet on .
"but unfortunately , <unk> are <unk> , at least known as the primates ."
"they <unk> life into deep <unk> of the water , and they &apos;re very hard to have the <unk> ."
"congo is a paradox -- it &apos;s an amazing <unk> of diversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness , the <unk> of a <unk> of half an <unk> , which has just been <unk> to as many <unk> in world war as we did ."
this was surprising that these destruction are also survival at risk of the <unk> .
<unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> will make sure you couldn &apos;t fill the <unk> at the end -- and yet that &apos;s not sure we &apos;re honest with it .
"yet , in this country of violence , you &apos;re able to hear a <unk> , that the trees hear the trees are <unk> ."
how do these <unk> ?
"we know them as &quot; war instead of war , &quot; <unk> , &quot; because they have sex <unk> and <unk> with <unk> partners and the ability and rules about <unk> social <unk> ."
i don &apos;t say that it &apos;s the best answer to all the problems of <unk> -- but life is made out of the most than <unk> <unk> .
<unk> -- how people -- love to play their lives long .
play doesn &apos;t mean just <unk> .
"and for us and , they are fundamentally essential to the <unk> relationships of relationships and the <unk> of tolerance , the way that we do ."
"we learn trust the trust , and the web of game ."
"game is <unk> and creativity , and it &apos;s all about changing all of these things -- about diversity -- across diversity , diversity of behaviors , diversity of compounds ."
"and when you look at the game level , you &apos;ll see <unk> of human <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ."
play is the key one that we have .
"well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i &apos;d like to show you some of some unique images from the wild ."
first of all the way in <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about it .
so here we see an <unk> <unk> female in a <unk> .
look what makes you .
"that could be the evolutionary origin , &quot; they put it in <unk> . &quot;"
just i think it <unk> to him rather than true .
yes !
"so <unk> are spreading from <unk> , both with people too ."
"and the video is really interesting , because it is <unk> -- and that video is really interesting to you -- because that shows that it gives new elements of games to the game -- and how the moral industry also leads to the level of it , and the game -- and both ."
but the game is <unk> .
"play is an <unk> , and it can <unk> many forms of <unk> that some have some kind of stuff , more <unk> , curious to see the <unk> back ."
"and i want to show you , that is just a <unk> , a <unk> female , and she &apos;s playing with <unk> ."
"i think exactly how you &apos;re playing , we &apos;re sometimes <unk> from our inner limits and outside ."
"and this <unk> curiosity <unk> us , and they &apos;re interacting with us , and the <unk> that are <unk> that we are <unk> of creativity ."
this is just an <unk> of <unk> of learning that <unk> us into our past and present .
"but she also is a secret to our future , for our future , in which we have to <unk> the future of <unk> challenges , to <unk> information , by larger creativity and cooperation ."
so the key is that the game of the key to the skills to be the <unk> .
"in the other words , game is our <unk> game ."
"so , to <unk> us , we &apos;ve got an <unk> world ."
but will we make the best in our <unk> ?
play isn &apos;t <unk> .
it &apos;s essential .
"and <unk> and humans <unk> , they are not all <unk> and they have all of their lives ."
"now , the thing that seems that it &apos;s really easy to be <unk> at a point ."
"and so , my <unk> , let &apos;s do that gift of the evolution and play together in the same way , as we <unk> creativity , the <unk> ."
thank you .
"i &apos;m going to think that they &apos;re going to take two <unk> , <unk> at the same time , right at the same moment , every <unk> a baby ."
"so two <unk> , every single person <unk> a baby ."
"now , i don &apos;t want you to have time <unk> to think about the <unk> time , because if you can take all the time to imagine what they &apos;re not hearing ."
imagine that &apos;s just a second now .
"and by this scenario , imagine that in an case that <unk> is the <unk> y <unk> that <unk> the x prize for <unk> ."
"and in the other case , this is the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the x bottle , that hits the x <unk> ."
they are both <unk> and both <unk> .
and we &apos;ll go back to these people .
i &apos;ve got two of my favorite projects by most of my life .
in one of these <unk> i <unk> with the history of <unk> .
"i &apos;m a medical study , and at this case , i <unk> people , like people with <unk> <unk> -- -- that &apos;s human body , <unk> body <unk> with <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , as they were thinking about the body ."
"the other one i was <unk> , i was wearing the <unk> one , <unk> -- <unk> -- or as i say , as a <unk> <unk> , of people of <unk> ."
"in that case , i &apos;ve worked with people , who have been talking about the social norms , the social norms ."
this is the kind of thing that i worked with people who have <unk> <unk> are two people in a body .
"so i &apos;ve been working with people with <unk> <unk> -- so humans , smaller than that were born ."
"and so many times , i &apos;ve worked with <unk> people , whose gender is <unk> -- which , people that don &apos;t <unk> the average <unk> of female health or female <unk> ."
and the general term that we can use the word <unk> .
"<unk> , in many different forms of shapes ."
i &apos;m just going to give you some examples of the types of <unk> <unk> which are not <unk> or female .
"in one case , maybe someone with a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the gene of y <unk> leaves the <unk> that we have at all have <unk> stage at <unk> <unk> ."
and so there are <unk> <unk> with testosterone .
"but because the individual are <unk> <unk> to <unk> the testosterone , the bodies don &apos;t react to the testosterone ."
and this is called <unk> <unk> .
"so a lot of obsession , but it doesn &apos;t respond to this ."
"as consequence as the body is increasing , more of the typical female trends come ."
"if the kid &apos;s born , you &apos;ll see them look like a girl ."
she is one girl . she &apos;s <unk> as a girl .
"but it &apos;s often <unk> until it gets to the <unk> , and their <unk> grew , develop , but doesn &apos;t get their period , until somebody else comes up , there &apos;s something different ."
"and they make a couple of tests , and finding out that instead of <unk> and <unk> , in fact , they <unk> into a <unk> , and she had a y ."
"and it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually keep that person for actually more <unk> , but they &apos;re not really true ."
"women like men , have something called <unk> ."
and you &apos;ve come in the <unk> of your body .
and the <unk> make <unk> <unk> that are <unk> hormones .
"most women , like this , as i say , i think that i do not know in the typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real real <unk> but i think that i probably have the typical <unk> in <unk> ."
we produce carbon <unk> and we talk at <unk> .
and the implication was that somebody like me did have a brain that was more <unk> than a woman born with <unk> and has <unk> .
"and the gender is really complicated , so <unk> , not just in the middle of gender , in a single , in some of the way , they can be around by the entire range ."
"another example , a couple of years ago i got the call from 19 / 11 years of man who was born when young , he had a friend , she had a friend and he was living on her friend , he &apos;d find a <unk> and she was found a <unk> ."
he had one <unk> form of an <unk> shape .
"he got <unk> <unk> , and in the western <unk> , his <unk> were so highly active that basically made a male <unk> ."
"and as the result , its <unk> <unk> <unk> , his brain was <unk> to <unk> <unk> portion of that <unk> ."
"and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- he was no <unk> something ."
"and only by the time he got 19 to get enough medical issues , actually because it was just in front of him , because he found that the doctors found it was inside ."
"all right , just one quick example , for <unk> of <unk> ."
"so some people with <unk> formula ; something called the <unk> system , where <unk> is <unk> by <unk> ."
so we don &apos;t know precisely why it &apos;s going on .
so gender can have <unk> in many different <unk> .
"because the reason children with this kind of body -- is that it &apos;s <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> -- often that &apos;s available in the response , not because , for its physical level of advantage ?"
so in many cases these people are completely healthy .
and the reason why you &apos;re going to be <unk> in many different types of <unk> <unk> is because they &apos;re <unk> to use our social categories .
"in fact , our system is based on the idea that a certain of the <unk> has <unk> with one particular identity ."
"so we have the concept that a woman is to have a feminine identity , a black person will be in order to have a african , is supposed to have a <unk> on their own story ."
"so , we have this awful <unk> idea ."
"and if we are <unk> with a body who is actually something very different for us , then <unk> <unk> us to do that ."
so we have a lot of romantic ideas from <unk> .
"and our nation , really on a very powerful concept from <unk> ."
"well , you can imagine what this amazing is , once children get born to two people in a body ."
"in recent <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> <unk> , was the most famous <unk> <unk> <unk> last year whose gender <unk> were <unk> at berlin in berlin ."
"a lot of journalists called me the question : &quot; the question they &apos;re going to do , how do you make us make us feel that we &apos;re <unk> <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;"
and i had to explain the journalist that this test doesn &apos;t give you a test .
"we already know that gender and it &apos;s complicated that we need to be so <unk> that nature is not going to <unk> between the <unk> and <unk> , or <unk> <unk> and the <unk> , and <unk> are , we &apos;re the ones of <unk> and <unk> as well ."
"and so we have a situation where we have <unk> , as our science <unk> , we have to be so more <unk> that these categories that we <unk> are given to local <unk> , which were very simple <unk> to create a lot of <unk> <unk> ."
and this is not just about the sex .
"and it &apos;s true about the race , more complex than our <unk> ."
with our <unk> we get into all different parts of the world .
"we &apos;ve got the fact that in fact , we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees ."
what is that that we should start with the fact that we &apos;re different from them from a few <unk> ?
"as we keep our science and further forward , we &apos;ll get increasingly in the zone of the field , which we need to prove to know that <unk> categories that we &apos;ve had so hard too long ."
and we are seeing that throughout all kinds of human life .
"one of the areas where we see this in the <unk> , our culture is what we think today in the u.k. are the <unk> about the start and the end of life ."
"and we have a hard talk about something that <unk> to human , that &apos;s how that he &apos;s a very , very different than the most expensive life ."
"we have very difficult <unk> , maybe not as the public level as in medicine -- the question of when somebody is dead ."
our ancestors had never <unk> <unk> with the question when somebody was dead .
"you have somebody <unk> an <unk> in the nose , and if she moved , you haven &apos;t been <unk> ."
"if they didn &apos;t move more , you get it <unk> . &quot;"
but we &apos;re in a situation today where we &apos;re taking people from <unk> and taking them to <unk> them in other individuals .
"and as a result , we <unk> to our head with which really hard question when somebody is dead and this leads us to a truly difficult situation where we have no longer as simple as the <unk> as we used ."
"now , you may be able to <unk> this out by categories someone like me were really happy ."
"i am political , i have a <unk> with <unk> bodies , but i have to <unk> , i have to make it nervous ."
to realize that those categories really are a lot more <unk> than we think that &apos;s made me feel <unk> .
and it makes me <unk> with <unk> to <unk> democracy .
"so to tell you about this <unk> , i &apos;ve got to <unk> i &apos;m a big <unk> of a <unk> ."
"i know they &apos;re <unk> -- i know they were <unk> , but they were amazing ."
"i think they were so hard and very much , and so differently , which i was <unk> to take me all the years from looking at <unk> <unk> &apos;s side , and it &apos;s not because it &apos;s absolutely <unk> to forget ."
that &apos;s because <unk> with a <unk> of what happens .
and the <unk> was from the view that were actually the first <unk> activists of the <unk> forces .
"what she was doing was a concept concept , and she <unk> it through another that has been radically and beautiful and 200 years to come from us ."
"as you all do , <unk> <unk> our idea of concept to the very , which is a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in a very <unk> concept of <unk> ."
"the <unk> of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept based on the dna , however , but they got a concept of the computer system ."
they had a concept of <unk> blood .
"they were the notion that people who have the political power to do this political <unk> should do , for the <unk> <unk> <unk> , to the father , for this as well , to the way ."
and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> and <unk> it through a new concept that <unk> to say that concept was that all the people were created .
"so they were using the <unk> , and they decided that <unk> , which was the <unk> <unk> , not the differences , and that was very radical ."
and so they made this part because it was part of a <unk> system where two things together were <unk> .
"as democracy grew up , but the same time is starting to <unk> science ."
"if you look at the story of <unk> , many of you have been very interested in science were very interested in <unk> , and they were interested in a concept of an art ."
"they went away from <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> things like <unk> , <unk> , from doing , where the transmission of a very <unk> <unk> ."
they moved into a more <unk> concept .
"and , in terms of the things that you see , for example , you talk about nature and the god of nature ."
"not talking for god and nature , not <unk> ."
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to say who we are .
"and as part of this , it gives us a notion of <unk> <unk> ."
and so they prepared the future for a really wonderful way to <unk> .
"you didn &apos;t think about it , but what it did for us was great ."
so what did this happen for several years ?
"for example , women using their <unk> , the idea for law , which is saying that <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> , and we said , &quot; that we have a <unk> and <unk> , and not as much as much as much as the difference we can be in the norm we do , that they don"
and women <unk> it successful <unk> .
"the next came up to the <unk> <unk> , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> <unk> , who were not there ?"
"we find men in the <unk> series of <unk> , and they say , &quot; i am a man . &quot;"
"<unk> : again , humans <unk> , <unk> into the <unk> of <unk> ."
you see the same thing in the <unk> .
"of course the problem is that as we start to consider all the <unk> , we &apos;re starting to get to ask questions why we have certain special <unk> of the problem ."
"all right ? <unk> , i &apos;d like to see specific <unk> in <unk> , in our culture ."
"so for example , i don &apos;t like to have a fish that doesn &apos;t give you the same rights as a human as one ."
and i don &apos;t want to say we should take away from the <unk> .
"so i don &apos;t want to say , <unk> , should have to give your <unk> to sex or to someone else ."
"there are some <unk> both <unk> that make sense for sense , which we think i should keep ."
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is that they are and how we keep it up and how they make it make sense .
so come back to these two creatures that were <unk> at the beginning of <unk> .
"we have two qualities , both in the middle of which is <unk> at the same same day ."
"so let &apos;s imagine that one of you , maria , <unk> <unk> was born three , so she was born in june of june 1980 ."
"henry , on the other side , being born for <unk> , so he &apos;s born in the average 1980 ."
"it was only because of the fact that maria was born three months , <unk> , they were born all <unk> on top of three months ago : the right to <unk> <unk> sex , right to give you right ."
"henry have to be waiting for this . it &apos;s not because he &apos;s really having other <unk> , just because of their <unk> of birth ."
we can find another real <unk> to what their rights are .
"henry , you &apos;re paying you to be <unk> -- because i don &apos;t saying that the <unk> &apos;s -- you know that &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> to , he &apos;s going to be <unk> , and he &apos;s not going to worry about the maria ."
"but the <unk> , not in all states , you can see the same right that , henry in all states , has gotten in any position to marry ."
"henry can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only married today a woman in a few states ."
so we have these <unk> <unk> categories that are now <unk> to the trouble and more efficient .
"and so the question for me is , what is we going to do is to do with our science processes in the field of <unk> that we can achieve a point where we need a <unk> that might impact <unk> ?"
"i don &apos;t want to give the science , but i think it &apos;s always like the science does , it &apos;s got to <unk> ."
so where do we walk ?
"this seems like our culture of <unk> , <unk> , which means , we have to move a line somewhere , so we move it anywhere . &quot;"
but a lot of people would get in a very strange position .
"so for example , texas has <unk> to a point that to marry a man is that you didn &apos;t have a <unk> y or married to get married , and a woman to have a y <unk> ."
"well , in practice , people are not being able to test their <unk> ."
"but also , it &apos;s very popular because of the story that i &apos;m telling you about at the time ."
"if we &apos;re seeing one of the modern <unk> of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , she &apos;s <unk> us in his &quot; i have a dream , &quot; a sort of solution ."
"he says , &quot; we should &apos;t ask people &quot; their <unk> , but for the character of your character &quot; <unk> , and goes beyond this ."
"and i &apos;d like to say , &quot; well , that sounds like a right . &quot;"
but how do you do that in practice ?
how does people <unk> people on their <unk> ?
"i &apos;d like to point out that i don &apos;t really agree that to the right thing that we &apos;ve been going to <unk> on people in terms of the other <unk> , because i &apos;ve probably had a series of <unk> that probably <unk> a different <unk> to people ."
"and so , i want to think that i would have some <unk> of the <unk> , which are a <unk> that are <unk> <unk> and makes decisions about their <unk> , rather than a number of some of the <unk> that i know ."
so how do we put the question for the qualities of the character ?
"it turns out , really hard ."
"and one part of me would ask , what if the content were a personality of your <unk> in the future of <unk> -- could be <unk> by an <unk> ?"
do we really want to do that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where to go .
"now , what i know is the point out there is really important about thinking that the u.s. is in <unk> , the <unk> of the question of democracy ."
"in our effort for democracy , we &apos;ve done our thing right now and i think we &apos;d do the thing our work ."
"we haven &apos;t <unk> the situation , such as it as iran is in iran where a man feels sexually <unk> with other men , being punished , for death , that it &apos;s going to be ready for the <unk> <unk> <unk> , in which he &apos;s <unk> ."
"<unk> of these species , not in us ."
"and i &apos;m glad to try to say that this was a surgeon that i didn &apos;t have a surgeon that i spoke with a couple of years ago had a <unk> <unk> to do , to be part of them in a name ."
"but when i was <unk> , and asked him , why was they doing these <unk> <unk> -- he was <unk> to his answer that , the answer , that these children were <unk> very ill , and the reason he had to do it ."
"i went to him , &quot; now , are you <unk> political <unk> , instead of having one surgery to separate them ? &quot;"
"and the united states is an incredible opportunity to be people that you have , without changing , to the state of state ."
"so i think , you have to be a <unk> ."
"well , just to try and notice that i &apos;ve been talking to a lot about the fathers ."
"and i would love to think about the opportunities , like democracy might look , and i could have looked back if we had more to mothers ."
"and i want to say something which is radically radical for a <unk> , and that &apos;s , i think there might be various species that <unk> different species of the <unk> <unk> <unk> when people are using a biological system ."
"so for years , because i was interested in <unk> , i also <unk> in this <unk> ."
and one of the things i really felt interesting is the difference between men and women in ways to how you think and <unk> in the world .
"what we have learned from <unk> study is that women , on average , not any , but in average , more and tend to be complex social relationships and care for people who are in much more <unk> , much more attention ."
"and so if we think about that , we &apos;ve got an interesting situation in front of us ."
"years ago when i was making an <unk> , asked me a <unk> i knew how my interest of feminism -- i was watching myself as a <unk> , so it does -- a really serious question ."
"he said , &quot; tell me what feminism is . &quot;"
"and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the <unk> question i ever heard ."
"feminism : it is <unk> of <unk> about sex , that is not the fear of fear ."
but the more i thought about his question for the more i thought that there might be something <unk> in feminism .
"that &apos;s what it means to give you something called average , <unk> , <unk> <unk> are different brains that makes us different from <unk> what makes us <unk> of social relationships and <unk> us to <unk> ."
"so where the <unk> were very <unk> , how individuals could be protected from the state is that there &apos;s been possible to <unk> by that way , to be able to give you more <unk> , we can &apos;t <unk> the idea just as we &apos;re spending ."
and maybe we need to go and see where we have to go and see if we &apos;re using democracy in terms of <unk> about the individual body -- less about the body and to think about more relationships .
"so that if we try to make people more <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other ."
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> and this is my suitcase .
"but before i show you what i am doing , i &apos;m about a very public <unk> , and that &apos;s , i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> ."
"i love it for any chance to find a different <unk> , crazy <unk> , and have to wear and photograph recently to photograph and write out ."
but i didn &apos;t make any new .
i get all my clothes out of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
"<unk> , thank you ."
<unk> allows me to reduce the influence of my <unk> into the environment and even <unk> the <unk> .
"i &apos;m going to meeting all kinds of great people , my dollars for <unk> purpose -- i look quite unique ; i see it &apos;s very unique ; it makes me a <unk> for me to see my personal <unk> ."
"i mean , what am i going to find today ?"
will my size have that size ?
do i like the color ?
is it going to be less than 20 dollars ?
"and as everyone answers , i feel i feel like i won ."
and i go to my suitcase and i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ve done for this exciting week here at ted .
"i mean , what do you get with so many <unk> with it ?"
so i &apos;m going to show you just a little bit what i &apos;ve brought with .
"i brought seven <unk> to <unk> , and that is everything ."
i have all kinds of stuff that &apos;s done in my suitcase just a week .
i have a sense of <unk> that i would find anything i could wear if i were only going to get to <unk> .
"and they don &apos;t hear by me as the woman who &apos;s here at ted in their <unk> -- that &apos;s , i found a couple of things ."
and i would like to just show you my <unk> for this week .
sounds good .
"as i do that , as i also , i &apos;ll leave you a few of the lessons that i believe in , not just that <unk> you learned from these <unk> , none ."
let &apos;s start with <unk> .
i call this the garden tigers .
you don &apos;t have to have a lot of money to spend a lot of <unk> .
you can only feel great for less than 50 dollars .
"this whole <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> has <unk> <unk> me , it had <unk> to get this <unk> piece i had on this whole week ."
"it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , one ."
it &apos;s almost <unk> to be bad at being a <unk> <unk> if you &apos;re wearing <unk> .
"if you &apos;re happy , you turn other happy people ."
tuesday : <unk> adaptation will be absolutely <unk>
"i spent a very lot of my life trying to be , i <unk> myself , and i am <unk> to ."
"get them , just who you are ."
"and if you surrounded by the right people , they won &apos;t just understand , you will appreciate it too ."
<unk> : do it <unk> your <unk> <unk>
sometimes i get people to say i saw when i take out of &apos; <unk> or i remember it &apos;s <unk> .
"so i like to go and say , &quot; thank you very . &quot;"
"<unk> : <unk> , is the key ."
"when they think they &apos;re in something well , that &apos;s almost secure ."
"and if you think they &apos;re not in something good , they probably &apos;re in quite well ."
i grew up with a mother who taught me day .
"but just as i became 30 , i really did understand what that means ."
and i &apos;ll just give that for you .
"if they think that they &apos;re inside and <unk> , and they &apos;re a wonderful person , there is nothing they can &apos;t carry ."
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone in this room .
we should be able to <unk> anything that we want .
so thank you .
"friday : a <unk> truth -- five words , golden balance ."
"and finally , <unk> , that is to develop a kind of <unk> , personal style is a great way to tell the world without telling a word ."
"i got to always <unk> when people came to me , just because of the time i had just just since i was wearing . and i had great conversation ."
"clearly , it &apos;s not going to be able to fit everything in my tiny suitcase ."
"so before i get home <unk> , i will cut it up again ."
because the lesson i tried to learn from this week is it &apos;s okay .
"i don &apos;t have to be emotional <unk> because , in the corner it gets to make a different crazy crazy , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , that just waiting for me to love a bit , and find it ."
thank you much .
thank you .
"good day , all together ."
i have a bit of one that i want to show you .
and think of it as being <unk> as an <unk> .
"that &apos;s what we call in our lab , we call the <unk> design of design ."
let me tell you a little bit about it .
"now if you &apos;re taking this image -- i &apos;m originally a <unk> , and everybody in italy has <unk> with this picture in his room , but why i &apos;m showing it in this , why i &apos;ll show you that in the formula something really interesting happening ."
"so before a moment , when you wanted that a formula to race , you took a budget , you took her budget and gave her money to make you good car , a good car ."
"and when the car and the car were good enough , then they won this race ."
"now , today , they have a <unk> , in fact , in fact , that this one is -- a little like this -- has been <unk> , some thousands of sensors that information from the car , in the brain and then they <unk> them on the system ."
"they would like to call them in <unk> , an <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
and basically it is a system that is made by two parts -- a <unk> part and one <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting to the interesting days is the <unk> begin with our life <unk> .
"our cities have been <unk> for over the last few years , with <unk> and electronics ."
they are going to be in the computer .
"and as computers in the free , they begin to respond to the other way , to be seen , they &apos;re <unk> and <unk> ."
"and as we have cities , this is really a big thing ."
"i &apos;d like to say that cities only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population lives there ."
they are 75 percent of the energy -- and it &apos;s about 80 percent of our co2 emissions .
so if we &apos;re doing something with cities . that &apos;s a big thing .
"the cities , moving all that activity , and drive all of that environment into everyday life ."
"this is an <unk> that <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> later on the summer of summer , organized ."
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> me . &quot;
"now , all our objects , our environment , start to talk back ."
"in some sense , it &apos;s almost as if any <unk> is there will become both out out of there , a sensor ."
and it &apos;s radical the interaction that we have people out there with our environment .
"it was like almost like the old dream , <unk> ..."
"you know , when <unk> <unk> <unk> , it means that at the end , it <unk> at a hammer and took him on <unk> <unk> -- and she still still <unk> a little <unk> -- and said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; you know ?"
"so , today , our environment begins to start to answer us ."
"i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , through the idea , to see the environment and to keep on ."
and let &apos;s start with that <unk> .
and so the first project i &apos;m going to introduce to you to is actually one of the first of our own <unk> .
it was a half a month ago in italy .
"and what we &apos;ve done then has actually been able to use new kind of network , which was used throughout the world -- that &apos;s a <unk> and <unk> information system from this network of <unk> , and <unk> the network of <unk> to be <unk> ."
"the summer was a <unk> summer , in 2006 ."
and it was as a italy <unk> .
"a couple of them are <unk> to do , it was <unk> at a time in italy , and then at the end of <unk> , the <unk> ."
"and anyway , italy the end has won ."
"now you see what happened to this day , just when they &apos;re looking at activity in the network that &apos;s happening ."
"here , you see the town ."
"you look at that in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"so , in the tomorrow , in front of a game ."
you see the timeline .
"people in this afternoon , you know , the calls are phone , and they &apos;re moving ."
"the game starting to play , just <unk> ."
"<unk> is a <unk> . in italy , a <unk> power ."
"<unk> , people make a brief call , go to <unk> ."
second <unk> . at the end of the normal <unk> .
"first <unk> , second ."
"<unk> , in one moment of the <unk> <unk> ."
italy wins . yeah .
"well , in those night , all of you went to celebrate the center ."
and they looked at this great <unk> .
"the next day , everyone went to the center of the election and meeting the prime minister had to meet the same time ."
so all of the down .
"you see the image of the space of the space , where for the time that people had to celebrate -- have a great party to come to have , and you see the <unk> at the end of the day ."
"now , that &apos;s an example that we can have , just to feel the city , in the way we could not have been able to do a few years ago ."
"another quick example of feeling , not here &apos;s what people do , but for things we use , and consume ."
"well , now today &apos;s today we know everything from where our stuff are coming ."
"so this is a map that shows you all the <unk> of these things , which is the mac is going to come back together ."
but we know little about what the stuff &apos;s going on .
"so , we &apos;ve actually created some little bits in the project to track the waste through the system while the system is going to go through ."
"so what we did with several volunteers , who started working with one more than one year in seattle , who helped things to do -- <unk> <unk> different kinds of things , how you can see them ."
"and then we have these little <unk> that are <unk> that <unk> of the <unk> , and we started to track it out ."
these are the results of which we just have right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
and this information was that we realized there was a lot of information in the system .
we can do the same thing with less energy .
the data had never been <unk> before .
"but this has done a lot of cool things , more complicated stuff ."
"but what &apos;s the other thing is that we believe in every day , we see that that cup that we throw away , it just doesn &apos;t simply disappear to that there anywhere on the planet ."
and the <unk> that we keep off every day still there .
"and when we would show people , we can push a <unk> forward ."
"so , that &apos;s why this project ."
"and my colleague , with <unk> , who <unk> <unk> <unk> , could give you much more about it and the many other wonderful things you can tell to you , but i want to talk about this in the second part , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re beginning to talk to be on the start from the"
"and the first project is something that , we did a few years ago in spain ."
"and this started out with a question of the <unk> , which came to us , saying that spain and <unk> have a wonderful tradition to use place in public and a part of architecture ."
"and the question was : how could you combine technology , new technology to <unk> ?"
"and one of the ideas that were <unk> by in a <unk> <unk> are by now , put those <unk> in front , and the <unk> , you know , and you &apos;re <unk> , the opening and you &apos;re opening up and the opening ."
it &apos;s <unk> the kind of <unk> of water with <unk> .
"so when they fall out of the <unk> , they can write a picture , they can make pictures , pictures of <unk> ."
"and they can be approaching , and it will open up to let them get <unk> as you can see ."
"well , we introduced the <unk> <unk> ."
so him <unk> for him .
"and we were getting the <unk> building , to design the expo ."
"we called this the digital water , you &apos;ve got to see it ."
the whole building was <unk> of water .
"there &apos;s no doors , or windows , but if they &apos;re <unk> it is to open it up , and let me go into it ."
the roof was covered in water as well .
"and if it &apos;s <unk> , if you like the <unk> <unk> you can even keep the roof ."
"or you might end that building the whole building and all architecture is going in this case , you know when you get the roof , they get images from people who were there and say &quot; you had the building . &quot;"
"no , they didn &apos;t <unk> that building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears ."
and so here is how the building works .
"and so you see what the person &apos;s going on , what &apos;s going on inside ."
"and i look at myself when i was trying to do the sensors we tried using the water , not to get wet ."
"now , i should tell you what happened at night when all sensors worked on sensors ."
"but actually , that night , it was still greater fun ."
"all kids in a new <unk> came from the building , because the way they played the building were quite different ."
"no longer a buildings that would open to you , but a building i &apos;d still had , you had to go into water and <unk> into it ."
"and that &apos;s what it was , very <unk> for us , because as architects , engineers , as a designer , we will think about how people are doing things we use ."
but the reality is always <unk> .
and that is the beautiful thing about creating things that are used to interact with people .
"so here &apos;s a <unk> image with the mental model , from the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> from water , <unk> to that ."
and this is what &apos;s made us thinking about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine these <unk> could actually start to fly .
imagine that you could have little <unk> coming through the air and take you with your little <unk> of <unk> with a little <unk> <unk> <unk> -- almost how the cloud can move through the space .
this is the video .
"imagine a <unk> , just like you see you &apos;ve seen before , <unk> , <unk> in <unk> ."
they can have that cloud .
"they can have a kind of emotional monitor and <unk> , like this -- a <unk> structure <unk> into two dimensions ."
"or <unk> in three dimensions , which , where this changes , the light is not the place ; it &apos;s not the <unk> ."
they can play with different kinds of kinds of things .
"imagine what the screen could just come in different <unk> or <unk> , into different ways ."
but then this could be just a 3d cloud of <unk> that you <unk> and you can move through and look through them from a lot of directions .
"so here you see a real <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to shape like a <unk> of shapes ."
"if you <unk> that light up , it looks so much like this before you saw it ."
imagine every individual will be <unk> .
"it could have any <unk> that would have a momentum that comes from people , from the <unk> of the human and something ."
i want to show you a little bit here .
"we &apos;ve worked with <unk> <unk> <unk> , one of the most successful <unk> of our time -- the <unk> of the center of science in new york and in <unk> in <unk> -- we took its motions for the <unk> ."
here &apos;s a very <unk> dancing dance .
on the left hand you see the <unk> that <unk> <unk> different <unk> .
"at the same time , there &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> ."
so you can see all the motion .
and they can make all of that stuff .
"but then once we <unk> all the time , you can play with color and you <unk> play and <unk> <unk> ."
we want it to be a kind of possible <unk> for the <unk> .
and i &apos;d like to show you the very <unk> project that we &apos;re working on to .
and it &apos;s something we work in the olympics for the olympic games .
"it &apos;s called the cloud , the cloud ."
"and the idea is , again , imagine what we do with the people to do , to change what the environment is to shift -- almost the way we call &quot; <unk> , as we call it , <unk> , a cloud of a <unk> , but a cloud ."
imagine if every little bit of a <unk> can give you a little <unk> for a <unk> .
"and i think it &apos;s the remarkable part of the last decade , and over the past decades , that we are <unk> by a physical world of a digital world ."
"this has all come in , knows , and it &apos;s <unk> available with the internet ."
"today , we can -- for the first time -- and the campaign has <unk> the <unk> -- that &apos;s how to be <unk> from the digital world , of the <unk> forces of the physics ."
"this can be , in our case , that we use to design and design a symbol of design ."
it &apos;s called something which is built in the city .
"but this morning , to <unk> us all the way of the challenges -- you think about climate change , or co2 emissions -- as we do from digital world to change the physical world ."
"the idea is that , we actually put people with <unk> in which they do stuff ."
that cloud &apos;s back a cloud of <unk> from the same way as a cloud of a <unk> cloud <unk> is .
"and these particles are the water , during our cloud , the cloud , is a cloud of <unk> ."
"it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> in london , but it &apos;s <unk> with <unk> ."
they can go inside and make a different kinds of experiences .
"you can actually look at that bottom , the most important moments for 2012 and sharing <unk> , and using it as the way of using community ."
"so both the physical cloud in the sky and the one at top you can go back , like london <unk> <unk> ."
you can <unk> .
"and there &apos;s a kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new way of experience for everybody , that would want to go to the top ."
thank you .
"as an artist , i &apos;m very important in the context of connection ."
"so through my work , i am trying to express that people are not separated from nature and that it &apos;s all connected ."
"the first time i was at the north of the past 10 years ago , in which i saw my first <unk> <unk> ."
i <unk> <unk> .
"my heart <unk> , i was <unk> when i was trying to <unk> what was happening ."
"the <unk> around me was growing up 60 meters of water , and only i could <unk> that one on a <unk> was one another year of <unk> ."
"<unk> are born when a <unk> is born , or using <unk> from <unk> ."
all of your own individual personality has its own individual experiences .
they are in <unk> ways they &apos;re developing and their experiences .
"some of you can take a <unk> and <unk> for the end , while others don &apos;t have <unk> <unk> and feel <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"so if you look at a top iceberg that you think you &apos;re isolated , separated from alone and alone , so that &apos;s how we &apos;re often seeing people ."
but the truth is far away from it .
"as a iceberg <unk> <unk> , i <unk> its <unk> atmosphere ."
as the iceberg it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> water that creates many different forms .
"i &apos;m going to my footage about this photograph of life as if there is portraits of my ancestors living in consciousness , that they have exist in those individual <unk> from these ways , and never ever existed ."
"it is not that death , when it is <unk> , it &apos;s not the end of the <unk> , but it &apos;s a <unk> of your <unk> along the <unk> ."
a part of the kitchen that i <unk> is a very young one -- a few thousand years old .
"and part of the <unk> is more than 100,000 years old ."
"so the last pictures i want to share with you , a vertical , which i have in front of <unk> ."
you can actually actually get a <unk> of a social network .
here &apos;s where you see it .
on the left-hand side they &apos;re going on a small boat .
this is about five meters long .
please see what they do on the shape of the <unk> and that &apos;s where it &apos;s on the edge of the <unk> .
"you can see here , he starts to <unk> , and the boat moves to the other side , the man has there ."
it &apos;s the average size of a <unk> .
"it <unk> about 120 feet from water , or <unk> ."
and that video is in real time .
and it &apos;s simply showing you another side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extremely blessed by working at some amazing projects .
"but with <unk> , what i &apos;ve been working on is this guy ."
his name is sound .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of &apos; 80s .
"then , one day , he came back and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs <unk> . &quot;"
and this was a outbreak of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is completely paralyzed today .
it can only use his eye .
and i stood toward him .
"and i have a company that &apos;s doing design and dynamic and animations , and it &apos;s also <unk> a complex part of what we &apos;re admire in the <unk> and paying attention ."
and so we decided to support tony -- and to support his thing .
"i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money ."
what is you going to do this ? &quot;
"his brother said , &quot; i &apos;ll just mention to tony . &quot;"
"i want to go again and i just ask , &quot; wait time , that &apos;s not there -- and i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t we communicate all of these people with these tools using this piece of stuff ? &quot;"
"and he said , &quot; no , just when you have heard in the more <unk> and a remarkable insurance is you can actually do it ."
ordinary people are not available to these devices . &quot;
"and i <unk> , &quot; how do you do it for you now ? &quot;"
anyone &apos;s seeing the movie &quot; and the <unk> ? &quot;
so they communicate -- this way goes along the finger .
"i <unk> , &quot; very well , how do you be ? &quot;"
so i came out with the need to just put a stick <unk> and instead i hired up a <unk> <unk> i didn &apos;t know about what i needed .
"i <unk> at the place and <unk> towards his brother and his father , with the <unk> , &quot; all my favorite , as the other person is going to talk , we &apos;ll get him a device , and we &apos;ll find his <unk> ."
"because it &apos;s a become , you know , the one who is wearing all this still cannot communicate . &quot;"
so i &apos;ve been talking about a couple of months later .
"and then i met this <unk> with <unk> research , and you &apos;ve got technology to allow it to draw a light on each surface and then i could use it with a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the only ground from the ground ."
so they <unk> and they go out and do <unk> like that .
and they tell all things that will come <unk> up and <unk> <unk> .
"it starts with the <unk> , and then the <unk> , the <unk> , and last people actually do art ."
but there were always a <unk> in her <unk> .
"so , i went home and dinner with my wife and told her about all and we thought , &quot; well , if there is a technology , then it could use this <unk> to make things , then they can be <unk> things to control things , and we could be <unk> , and i was a little"
this is the beginning of the journey .
"and about two years later , about a year after many years , a lot of organization and a whole bunch of things , we &apos;ve achieved some things ."
"the first , we have the <unk> out of the doors and we actually got the doors to this device that he can communicate , with stephen <unk> . i think that was a <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
this was incredibly .
"and he &apos;s really extremely <unk> -- you call him a <unk> , because you talk by him or you get an email and thinks , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , that guy &apos;s incredible . &quot;"
we have seven programmers from the all over all world -- literally from all parts of the world -- to home .
"my wife , my kids , and i went out to the garage , and i <unk> these hackers and the programmers and the <unk> have taken out our house ."
"many of our friends , thought that we were nice to do and we could <unk> all the images out on the walls and <unk> all of the walls ."
"but for two weeks , we <unk> , we went to <unk> school in <unk> and my kids , my dog and we went to <unk> it ."
this is called <unk> and you can see the description .
"so this is a cheap amount of <unk> that we buy at the <unk> of <unk> , some <unk> and some <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> ."
"and we took the <unk> , you <unk> them , you put them on an <unk> <unk> and now we have a device free to be <unk> -- you can build it , we put the code in software that can provide free ."
so we created a machine that &apos;s completely free from <unk> .
not insurance can be <unk> .
there is no hospital .
every <unk> can actually communicate with its eyes or touch .
thank you .
"thank you very much , this is incredible ."
"so by the end of two weeks , we went back in <unk> , <unk> ."
"i love this image because it &apos;s in the room of somebody else &apos;s room , and that &apos;s his room ."
"so now this one has been <unk> , before the great <unk> ."
"and after a year , planning , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> drew , drew tony <unk> for seven years ."
"and that &apos;s an <unk> picture , because it &apos;s his favorite <unk> and it looks like his <unk> ."
we have his bed <unk> so that he can look out .
we &apos;ve put one <unk> at the hospital <unk> by the hospital .
"and he <unk> again , for the first time in the <unk> of his family and a friends and friends -- and you can only imagine what a lot of a time in the parking lot ."
and we also had to put together in a parking lot of the space in <unk> and felt that we were <unk> ourselves as part of the <unk> <unk> .
"on the end , it gives us an email with <unk> <unk> , &quot; for the first time seven years , i did a living with seven years ."
"i felt that i became <unk> in the water , and finally someone <unk> to the lower and i can take a <unk> with my head . &quot;"
isn &apos;t it <unk> ?
that &apos;s something like our own <unk> .
this is what we think about as <unk> and we keep moving on to .
"so , we have to better at this device ."
"it &apos;s a amazing device , but it comes in a <unk> way ."
"and anybody that has one that <unk> such potential , it makes so much more ."
so we are to study how they do it better and <unk> and stronger .
"since that time , all the <unk> have been <unk> ."
we won a few <unk> .
"remember , it &apos;s for free , nobody made it from us ."
it &apos;s all from our own <unk> .
"so , the <unk> were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic , &quot; that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;"
"armstrong <unk> : over us and then , december december , so the <unk> has honored as one of the 50 stories of 2010 in real education was really grade ."
"and the <unk> part about that , and that <unk> all the circle -- that that &apos;s where , in fact , that april of los angeles will have <unk> a <unk> show called a <unk> of the world ."
"and there will be quite quite a <unk> in the hardest <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of these days of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> -- all these boys are going to be there ."
"<unk> &apos;s going to be part of the show , which is quite <unk> ."
"and so , basically , i &apos;m going to do that . you know that something that &apos;s impossible , and it can do it ."
"all in this room was impossible , this stage , this computer , this microphone that was <unk> -- there &apos;s anything that was impossible ."
make you feel -- they all the same .
"i &apos;m not a professional programmers and never had to do something else with <unk> , but i just took a little bit of it and just <unk> me out and <unk> with me in order to bring something together ."
"and this question should all of you have , and for every single day that something else you get done , which must do . if not , right now if not ? and if i do , please ?"
thank you .
"so , i write for kids , i &apos;m probably the most <unk> <unk> in <unk> ."
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t know how scientists will come .
"you can have me as a farmer to live , or in <unk> , but nobody has chosen ever been a farmer ."
"today , i &apos;d like to tell you about circles and <unk> ."
"now , <unk> <unk> is something normally you get there somewhere you &apos;re left ."
"you go to the <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> ."
that &apos;s an paintings of a painting .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the way of moving complex in which i want to tell you today .
"my circle began in this <unk> space at high school in <unk> , where i was the <unk> ."
"i was the one who was <unk> every week in the <unk> green and blue , <unk> my life ."
they <unk> my life by taking the toilet off the air .
they actually kind of <unk> them .
they &apos;re doing it for three years .
and i have to come from a city .
"i had a <unk> , i had been out of 85 dollars , and it was <unk> after san diego , and i found a <unk> at california -- and at the time in the &apos; 80s -- i discovered it was a <unk> process at <unk> ."
"about three or four years ago i was given the overnight a phone call from that <unk> , lady , lady that said , &quot; i have to see her . &quot;"
i am sad that we have never been learning as <unk> .
please go to the <unk> <unk> and please join you with the man i know that they found out it .
and i should say i have <unk> that and i want you to be <unk> . &quot;
"well , the next day we &apos;re in <unk> ."
"we saw them , we looked at <unk> , and we saw , we knew they &apos;d have to be in a <unk> ."
"we found one for them , we brought it together , and we <unk> them , and we gave them their family eight , because it &apos;s needed to do it ."
there was something that we knew to do .
"and just as the woman who wanted to learn to know me as an adults , she turned out to be a full <unk> of <unk> , and she was put into my hands ."
"what happened was the circle of the circle closed , it was a circle , and the <unk> of the <unk> i spoke about ."
"the <unk> is death , the death of life is part ."
"it &apos;s saving my lives , and my partner and i <unk> in her . &quot;"
"and you know , this part of life needs it all of the rest of life ."
"he takes truth , truth , and i am so happy that that &apos;s been mentioned today ."
"he needs , he &apos;s got to -- he needs love and pleasure , and it &apos;s too , to give us those things ."
thank you .
"imagine a big fan of a big <unk> , while you <unk> on a meter ."
imagine a <unk> <unk> .
"imagine a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , does that ."
that sounds fear <unk> .
"now , i had a <unk> in that particular day , and i was sitting on <unk> ."
i was the only one that could talk to the <unk> . &quot;
"so i looked at it , and they were like , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve <unk> some birds . &quot;"
"the <unk> had the engine in <unk> , and we were not as far away ."
you could see manhattan .
"two minutes later , three things <unk> , three things ."
the <unk> did the machine go out to the hudson .
so that &apos;s normally not the <unk> .
and he <unk> them down .
so let &apos;s imagine just an <unk> plane .
so he said three words : the most <unk> words i have ever heard .
"he said , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;"
i had to talk about nothing more with the <unk> world .
i can see it in your eyes because the <unk> was <unk> life .
i would like to share three things i learned about in the day .
i learned that there is something different in one moment .
"we have these <unk> , we have these things that we &apos;d do in life , and i was thinking to all the people that i want to make a hand and not really didn &apos;t want all the <unk> that i wanted to do all of the experiences that , i wanted ."
"as soon as i thought of it , i was thinking a <unk> <unk> , which is that , i <unk> <unk> bad <unk> ."
"because when the wine <unk> is , and the person &apos;s there , then i opens it ."
i never want to move anything more in life .
"and it &apos;s this idea , it really <unk> my life ."
"the second thing i was talking about this day -- and that was , as we started <unk> george washington bridge as quite <unk> -- because i thought , there &apos;s a thing that i really loved ."
i had a good life .
"and in my own humanity , and with myself , i think after it , to become better in everything i get ."
"but in my humanity , i also have given my <unk> space ."
and i get out the time that i <unk> to <unk> things with people who mean something to that .
"and i thought of the relationship with my wife , to my own , to people ."
"so then , as i thought , i was trying to make negative energy out of my life ."
"it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better ."
i didn &apos;t get a woman with me to my wife .
it feels great .
"i don &apos;t try to have more , but i &apos;m <unk> to be happy ."
"so the third thing i learned was in <unk> , and that is , <unk> <unk> , 15 , 14 , 13 , <unk> ."
you see it coming .
"so i said , &quot; please <unk> in the air . &quot;"
"and i don &apos;t want this thing to get into 20 parts of the point that , as you know it comes from <unk> ."
"as i was going on , i had this feeling of being human being die , i &apos;m not <unk> ."
so almost as we went through this long .
but that &apos;s really sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
"and that <unk> actually turns out to be in mind , which is that just for me to give up one thing ."
i just wish i could see my children grow growing .
so one month after a month i came to my father &apos;s <unk> -- <unk> not much <unk> talent ...
...
"and i hate <unk> , i <unk> like a little kid ."
and the world &apos;s <unk> to make sense to me all .
i was realized then by <unk> the dots that they &apos;re in living just about being a <unk> father .
"more than anything , all other things , my only goal in life is to be a good father ."
i was a wonder of what &apos;s going to be <unk> in that day .
"i was getting another gift to see this in the future , and back and to life , to live ."
my call all of you who are going to fly today is : imagine what &apos;s happening in flight -- please not -- but imagine how they &apos;re going and how to change and how would you change .
"what would you do to get you , because you think you &apos;d be there for the reason ?"
how did you change your relationships and do it the negative energy in this ? &quot;
and more and more than all of these are the best parents that you just can be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want to build iran that are iran to create .
"the most important <unk> there , as weapons of nuclear weapons , is the power of treating <unk> in <unk> ."
<unk> devices boxes you see there that these were <unk> .
"so when we get to <unk> that the systems that control the water and all of the <unk> , we can actually do a lot of problems with <unk> ."
these <unk> boxes don &apos;t run with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on another technology .
"but if we can do it that an effective <unk> in a laptop <unk> that used by a <unk> to put this <unk> box , then we are in business ."
and it &apos;s the planning behind <unk> <unk> .
"so , we start with a <unk> ."
"the <unk> are <unk> into the green box , the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> had been <unk> ."
"that &apos;s a <unk> , is it ."
i want to share with you how we found this .
"when we started to <unk> our research at six months ago , we started out to something of meaning and the purpose of the point of view ."
"the only thing we knew was really complicated about the <unk> portion of the most complicated , <unk> part , made of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> using ."
"and it seemed to have a little piece of <unk> with these <unk> boxes , these <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"the most <unk> our attention , and the very , we were starting to get a <unk> project that we had the living environment with a common <unk> , and we studied that sort of <unk> ."
and then something happened to <unk> .
"<unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> to our cheese , not <unk> him . but didn &apos;t want to <unk> him ."
that made sense to me in my eyes .
"and after we &apos;ve done with different types of cheese , that this is an <unk> attack ."
"completely , <unk> a <unk> target ."
"<unk> <unk> has been moving on the gray box , if a particular configuration . even when the special program that works to try to do this is on a target ."
"and if not , there &apos;s nothing wrong ."
"so , the <unk> really <unk> my interest and we started working with it , almost about the <unk> , because i figured out , now we don &apos;t know what the goal is ."
"it might be like , we can say , an american power of power , an american country , or is a <unk> <unk> ."
and so we should find it better soon to figure out what that goal is .
"so we <unk> and <unk> the <unk> code , and we found that in two digital <unk> is actually -- a smaller and a larger one ."
"and also , it turns out that they were very <unk> to people who had <unk> all <unk> information ."
they knew <unk> bits and <unk> to attack them .
"you know , they probably known the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ."
so they knew everything .
"and if you &apos;ve already <unk> , the <unk> <unk> is a complex and <unk> <unk> , let me tell you , the <unk> is a science for you ."
it &apos;s much more <unk> than everything we &apos;ve ever seen .
you see here an <unk> <unk> from these <unk> code .
"we speak here from -- about 15,000 lines ."
and this is what they look like as well as <unk> <unk> .
and what i would like to talk you about to you about is how we were able to be smart from this code .
"so after the first hand , we had <unk> <unk> , because we know what this is a thing ."
"and so we went through <unk> , and we tried to try and bring these things in the real world with real challenges -- with <unk> , in the real world ."
"so , we needed theories about what these goals were capable of being able to <unk> or <unk> ."
"and so to <unk> these theories , we call ourselves a <unk> , and it certainly is a <unk> goal -- it &apos;s got to make a <unk> goal and it &apos;s certainly in iran , because most of the infections were being introduced ."
now this area has been not a couple of thousands of goals .
"it &apos;s basically going to go on the <unk> , and down the <unk> in <unk> <unk> ."
"so i told my <unk> , &quot; well , i &apos;m saying to a list of all experts for <unk> and <unk> from our <unk> . &quot;"
and i <unk> you to the <unk> to know about what the <unk> <unk> is happening and what we find in the code and the data .
and it worked very well .
"so , it &apos;s been possible , to get the little <unk> <unk> with <unk> ."
"the <unk> part is <unk> in the <unk> , that black creature you see ."
"and if you put the speed from the <unk> of this <unk> , it &apos;s actually in fact that you could put your <unk> into your <unk> and you &apos;re actually <unk> the <unk> ."
"and what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the <unk> is actually going to be slowly and slowly and not to let it <unk> , obviously , to leave them in order for the situation to come quickly behind it fast ."
the large digital <unk> <unk> -- we received a <unk> by <unk> and <unk> .
"now , for example , the <unk> is very , very specific , from this code . you can &apos;t get it ."
"i started to do the scientific literature on how this <unk> <unk> and it found out that they were <unk> in <unk> , and they <unk> <unk> <unk> , every <unk> <unk> ."
so the purpose of this made sense that it &apos;s done .
it &apos;s getting better .
those <unk> in iran are <unk> by 15 degrees in <unk> .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
it &apos;s almost a very sophisticated structure .
"so again , that fit really together ."
"and this gave us a big <unk> for that , we studied it here ."
"well , remember that not me , it wasn &apos;t going like that ."
these results are being done by a couple of weeks .
and often we just <unk> into <unk> and we had to collect <unk> .
"anyway , we found that both digital professor of fact actually <unk> in one and the same target , but from different directions ."
"the small <unk> of <unk> a <unk> of <unk> and so the pyramid and then they turn them and they <unk> it with six <unk> with six <unk> in interaction , and <unk> <unk> ."
"so , in the big and , we &apos;ve been very <unk> of that , that we actually &apos;ve done what that is ."
it &apos;s <unk> and it &apos;s just <unk> .
and so we have to worry that the other goals might be made of <unk> .
so here &apos;s a really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- really made me get <unk> out of the <unk> .
"it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> box , and on , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> there ."
"well , what that <unk> does is that it <unk> the environmental policies of sensors -- like <unk> and <unk> -- and <unk> it up <unk> code , the <unk> code for the time , <unk> <unk> data on the wrong data ."
"and in fact , this is this kind of cool data of data is taken before ."
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> <unk> when it &apos;s <unk> that is <unk> <unk> before you get <unk> .
"this is cool , right ?"
"this idea of it , obviously , is not only that the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> ."
"actually , it &apos;s a lot longer dangerous and more <unk> ."
the idea is to <unk> digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> to where a human language can &apos;t respond fast enough enough .
"so for example , in the power of energy , the large <unk> , is going to be able to open up in space ."
"of course , that &apos;s not being done by a human race ."
"now , this is the place that is where there is a digital <unk> ."
"and if they &apos;re risk risk , they &apos;re really bad things ."
that &apos;s the power of power to <unk> .
"and neither <unk> , nor does the <unk> will notice that it &apos;ll be ."
that &apos;s very scary one .
but it is still worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is really important .
think about that . that is an attack .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily have anything in <unk> with <unk> .
"so for example , this is how well work -- in this power station , or in a <unk> station ."
it &apos;s <unk> .
"and you don &apos;t have to -- as if you &apos;re in the <unk> , you don &apos;t need to give the <unk> <unk> for you to get in a little <unk> ."
you could use <unk> <unk> technology to spread .
we need to only move it as well as possible .
"and if they do that , they eventually gets <unk> a <unk> ."
that &apos;s why we need to imagine it .
"now unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not <unk> <unk> at the middle east ."
"they are in the united states , in europe and japan ."
"so those green areas , these are the different environments ."
"and we need to put the consequences , and we start to get better <unk> ."
thank you .
i have a question .
"well in <unk> , it &apos;s been shown to be much of <unk> that people are being <unk> , so that the <unk> <unk> is behind behind it ."
does it feel like it ?
"okay , you really want to know that ?"
yeah . okay .
"i believe in this way , it &apos;s the driving force , but the driving force is not israel ."
so the driving power behind the force is the <unk> .
"and it &apos;s just one , and these are the states -- fortunately to be happiness ."
because <unk> would be our problem even bigger .
"thank you so much for <unk> <unk> , you have an <unk> . thank you ."
i spent the last couple of years working with <unk> situations that normally are very difficult to be dangerous and at the same time .
i went to jail -- i have to do it hard .
i &apos;ve been working in a <unk> -- dangerous .
"i was filmed at <unk> -- hard , hard and dangerous ."
"and i &apos;ve spent 30 days <unk> with nothing like this -- at starting to come out at the beginning , a rather difficult in the middle , a very dangerous way at the end , at the end ."
"i actually <unk> the most part of my career as an <unk> , in terms of <unk> , to just study it all the time , to try to study and look interesting and interesting are , and hopefully , to some sort of what makes it ."
"so when i knew i was coming here to look at the world from <unk> and <unk> , i knew a bit that was going to make something a bit else ."
some of you may have heard that i had a <unk> on ebay a few weeks ago .
"i <unk> some <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to get a <unk> at my tedtalk ."
"really , some people , a happy <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , got the <unk> chance -- because i am never going to give you chris anderson , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , and no one was going to have a <unk> at that stage that <unk> you just a lot in a"
"so what you did was do , the name of your tedtalk here : my tedtalk , my tedtalk they &apos;ve no idea what is going to have is going to be , and the one that you &apos;ve ever <unk> to go back to you on ears in <unk> , especially if she , particularly , especially when"
"but <unk> , because it &apos;s a very good opportunity to keep it ."
do you know how lots of humans look at this <unk> ?
all sorts of things .
this is just the <unk> of the <unk> .
"so despite that particular <unk> , i knew that anybody would buy the <unk> ."
"now if they asked me a year ago , if i would not have given it to you this ."
"but the new project i &apos;m working in , i &apos;m looking at my new film , we &apos;re looking at the world &apos;s marketing , for advertising ."
"and so , as i said , i went into some terrible situations a lot of awful situations , i didn &apos;t know anything about to myself , nothing might be able to go and so much so <unk> as this guy was going to walk into a space ."
"you know , i had the idea to film for a film ."
"what i want to do is take a film about the <unk> marketing and commercials , with all the film funded fund by marketing , marketing and marketing ."
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot;
so what &apos;s happening in the &apos; <unk> <unk> that goes on from top is that everything up from the bottom up to the beginning of the <unk> is <unk> of brands -- the <unk> you see the <unk> is the brand that is the brand .
"now this brand , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ..."
these people are going to be connected with the film in <unk> -- for whatever .
"so that &apos;s going to explore what this movie is going to come on -- is that what ? <unk> , for always ?"
i am a <unk> person .
so it was more to an opinion .
"it was &quot; <unk> , forever . &quot;"
"but not only will we get the brand for <unk> , but we will make sure that we &apos;ll be able to sell any <unk> in the film ."
"so we might sell a <unk> <unk> , and it will <unk> the one that they have ever been <unk> ."
"<unk> <unk> car that you &apos;ve ever <unk> in the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; the <unk> prize , that you have ever had , a sense of &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;"
"and the idea is to show up and <unk> , that brands are very different in life actually to get it to the <unk> ?"
and we &apos;re really showing this whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole <unk> is transparency .
so you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the video we &apos;re going to see .
"so this is the whole concept , all the <unk> , from the beginning to the beginning ."
and i would be happy if <unk> was going to help do this .
"you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i &apos;m listening to it , the <unk> , it is a <unk> respect for that audience ."
"i don &apos;t know how <unk> people get their own , right ?"
"have you a perspective — i don &apos;t want to take a look at &quot; perspective , &quot; because it has a negative <unk> <unk> -- but do you know how this is going to develop ?"
why much money will take to realize that ?
there &apos;s been <unk> <unk> .
"i think it &apos;s going to be tough to meet it , but i think it &apos;s a value , it &apos;s a lot of really familiar with <unk> ."
"now , who knows when the movie comes out , maybe we can see a <unk> ."
"what do they believe , what &apos;s it going to be ?"
"the answer will probably be very , &quot; no ."
"but is there a difficult <unk> , about this <unk> , or a tough thing for me ?"
<unk> : both .
"so , that means that not , that way ."
"so , my <unk> , do you help me ? i need help ."
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
"we need to <unk> , which brands brands ."
yes .
"and if you look at people , with those you are doing ."
we can put some of those that we can look at .
"now , put the camera off ."
"so i thought , &quot; you know , get your camera out of &quot; would mean that we wanted to have a heart <unk> ."
"it turned out that it meant to actually , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything with you that movie . &quot;"
"and just as that we did all these companies , one after the other ."
there was no one to do with the film .
i was <unk> .
they didn &apos;t want to have the world to do it .
"and i was confused , because i thought the whole idea of advertising was going to give a difference as many people as possible to see it as many people as you can as many people ."
"and in today , in the world , the interface of new and ancient media and the <unk> media system -- it &apos;s not the idea , in this new traditional exciting , that <unk> is <unk> that message to this news ."
"no , what i thought ."
"but you can see what that was , i was going to have an <unk> mistake , and that &apos;s a <unk> ."
"in fact , that wasn &apos;t the mistake that we don &apos;t actually ."
that would have been no problems .
it would have been fine .
"but , what this is the image of , is a problem ."
"and you see that when it <unk> transparency about the <unk> , that &apos;s -- this is actually one of the first pictures that looks ."
"i really like your kind of , <unk> <unk> . now ."
"and so this has been the problem : free -- <unk> , of glamour and <unk> , simply to find <unk> and <unk> ; <unk> from <unk> , <unk> to the access to information especially -- the latest line , <unk> is the world &apos;s biggest problem ."
"you know , you &apos;re hearing a whole lot about transparency ."
"our politicians say , our president says , it &apos;s even our <unk> ."
"but if there &apos;s <unk> that it &apos;s supposed to happen , it &apos;s changing ."
"but why ? and now , transparency is afraid of <unk> -- like this strange bear , that still is <unk> ."
it &apos;s <unk> -- like that strange <unk> .
and it is very <unk> .
what else is that ?
a whole bowl of <unk> <unk> food .
it &apos;s very <unk> .
"so i started talking to companies and told you to tell us that we wanted this story , &quot; no , we &apos;d want to say , &quot; well , we want you to be a story ."
"we want you to <unk> a story , but we just want them to <unk> our story . &quot;"
"look , as i was a child , and my father <unk> me to the lie -- and it &apos;s sitting and sitting and watch out of this -- he &apos;d say , &quot; oh , my son , there &apos;s three versions of the history ."
"there &apos;s my version , you have my version and there &apos;s the true version . &quot;"
"so , you see , with this clip we &apos;d want to tell the real thing ."
"but there &apos;s one <unk> , a <unk> company , to help us -- and this is because , i &apos;m in <unk> and richard <unk> since years , i &apos;ve been able to do this <unk> , i needed to go back to my team ."
"so what they were suddenly starting to understand : or what i started to understand -- that if you start talking about these companies that are getting a chance to understand , how to understand their brand is a <unk> problem ."
"i have friends , who are great , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and i have friends to make the small <unk> like i do ."
"and my friends , who take huge , huge <unk> , say that the reason why their movies are so successfully at the <unk> that they have ."
"and then my friends doing , they &apos;re doing little <unk> , &quot; now , how do we deal with these big , <unk> ? &quot;"
and that film is &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how do we see this <unk> in the film ?
"and whenever i go to the path , and i get the <unk> , you will see it <unk> ."
"and every time i have someone else , you can say , &quot; do you have enough to have that interview ?"
are you <unk> ? see some <unk> .
i would like to help them calm themselves on them .
so you should be doing a little bit of this before . &quot;
and then we give you a great <unk> .
"either <unk> fusion fusion , or &quot; a <unk> . &quot; they will have a <unk> ."
"we are going to be both of for men as well as men are both , <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , whatever they are ."
so that &apos;s the <unk> .
now i can give you all of the questions and give you a <unk> .
we are a smaller brand .
"so as they were talking about the smaller movies , we were as a brand ."
so we haven &apos;t had an budget as other brands .
"so that &apos;s how things do -- you know , people know about <unk> -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested ."
so what would you describe to them <unk> ?
<unk> is <unk> .
this is a great question .
<unk> : <unk> technology .
and technology is not the way you should have a bit of <unk> to make any of those <unk> .
"we talk about <unk> , <unk> ."
"and i think <unk> &quot; <unk> is a great word that this particular category really makes a difference , as opposed to as <unk> odor <unk> and <unk> . &quot;"
it <unk> you .
"we can keep it up longer and take it -- better fresh food , fresh , including <unk> ."
and things are a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
"i need to talk in the <unk> , that &apos;s how i am ."
and they want to tell me a little bit about my brand .
how do you tell your brand <unk> your brand .
"<unk> , my brand ?"
i don &apos;t know .
"now , i love to like beautiful clothes ."
"<unk> &apos;s <unk> &apos; 80s , <unk> to <unk> , except at <unk> ."
"well , what is the brand <unk> ?"
<unk> .
"i think the <unk> , the style i have is the &quot; <unk> glamour <unk> . &quot;"
"i like a lot of black colors , lots of <unk> and such stuff ."
but usually i have to be a <unk> in like <unk> or <unk> or just like that stuff .
"if dan were a brand , he would probably be the classic man &apos;s <unk> ."
"and man 2 : the brand that i &apos;m is i would say , i &apos;ll be <unk> ."
"woman 2 : in part of <unk> , part of the <unk> , part of it -- and i don &apos;t know ."
husband three : i &apos;m the <unk> .
"i have been <unk> throughout the entire country , world ."
so i think this is my brand for a second .
this is my brand in my small -- <unk> industry .
man four . my brand &apos;s <unk> because i was <unk> .
"man 5 : brand <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
do it ?
lawyer : i &apos;m an <unk> .
i am tom .
"now we can &apos;t be the ted <unk> , but i often see on the interface of <unk> , <unk> &apos;s flies , and <unk> <unk> ."
and what is found was that that i needed an experts .
"so , i needed anybody to make me <unk> in my head , somebody who could really help me understand what to call the &quot; <unk> . &quot;"
"and so , i found a company called <unk> in <unk> ."
"they helped businesses , like businesses , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to discover these things ."
"if they were able to do this for these , they might be <unk> for me ."
"they brought their pictures and you have them , yes ?"
"i have the first image , and the first shot of my family ."
let me say just a little bit of how this is connected and emotions about yourself .
these are people who <unk> my <unk> form .
tell me about the world .
"<unk> : that world ? i &apos;m thinking that the world &apos;s own world that you &apos;re doing , how people around you , the friends , the family , the kind of life that will live , and the work of work ."
all these things come and start from a place where i come and they begin to and start them with my family in west virginia .
"now , the next thing they &apos;re going to want to talk about is ."
this next . this is the most beautiful day of my life .
what relationship is that thinking about the thought and emotion that they face ?
it &apos;s like how i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like the <unk> <unk> . i like <unk> things .
tell me about &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what are they <unk> ?
what &apos;s the <unk> <unk> ? in what is you at all right now ?
"why is it important , what &apos;s the red ? what &apos;s the red ?"
tell me a bit more about this part .
"a bit more about them , not they are ."
what else have <unk> did they move ?
"... no , it must be afraid . what kind of <unk> are they ?"
"<unk> ! no , thank you ."
thank you very much for your <unk> .
yeah . all right now . good .
"yes , i don &apos;t know what will be <unk> out of this ."
and there were lots of crazy crazy things to go .
"the first thing that i saw was that her <unk> had two <unk> , but still <unk> pages -- that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> &apos;s and a <unk> brand ."
the <unk> were very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost an <unk> about it .
and i think some companies are only going to focus on one strength rather than both the .
"many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things where you &apos;re not sure , you &apos;re <unk> , those elements , and they &apos;re welcome to it , and actually , and they are in a <unk> to a <unk> in a little <unk> ."
what different brands are acting like ?
"the first is the classic , apple ."
"and you can see it here also , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> ."
"well , there &apos;s <unk> brands that have a lot of <unk> and <unk> brands , these things coming , but one , <unk> , <unk> brand is a very strong thing ."
"a <unk> , <unk> brand , how about your brand , right ?"
"if someone asked you to call the <unk> , their <unk> , how would they ?"
they &apos;re a <unk> ? are they something that makes the blood inside ?
or are you rather <unk> ?
"is it something that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> , isn &apos;t it ?"
"and <unk> are things that are <unk> and <unk> are <unk> like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you <unk> and <unk> <unk> ?
"they are <unk> , traditional , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> ."
"are you <unk> , stable , warm , safe , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> as the dalai lama or <unk> ?"
"over the course of the <unk> , we were having over the $ 500 , the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> were and the &quot; no saying that they were not the piece of this project ."
"they wanted nothing to do with this film , because they don &apos;t have control , they don &apos;t have any control about the finished product ."
"but when 17 <unk> have found the ready to <unk> in those control that wanted to do business with them as <unk> and <unk> as i was , by telling ourselves , that we could never support stories that we could not often have a <unk> -- you could never <unk> ."
"they were telling us to tell the history of <unk> how to tell the story in this film that we use now <unk> <unk> to make the brain &apos;s <unk> , both for <unk> of the film ."
"we were <unk> by <unk> , where they were <unk> ."
"over the middle city , there &apos;s no <unk> , no poster , nothing , no <unk> ."
"and we were driving in <unk> , in which companies <unk> their way into <unk> schools in <unk> , in all of america ."
"the incredible thing for me is that the projects of which i got most feedback and where i was the great success , these are where i <unk> things to do ."
and that &apos;s what those brands have done .
"because they <unk> , they <unk> the <unk> , and they said they don &apos;t actually have their interest in sense ."
i &apos;m going to fly directly with the performer .
"i get to work with him and create something completely different , one that people think about to <unk> is that our world is <unk> ."
and how did you do that ? what is it successful ?
"well the film that <unk> film was <unk> , we can take a look at that ."
"<unk> <unk> was the <unk> in january , and since then — and that &apos;s not the whole thing -- there was <unk> million more of <unk> that movie ."
now that <unk> is only one <unk> .
"that &apos;s only online -- no press , no press ."
the film was not necessarily <unk> .
there is no longer online ; it &apos;s no <unk> .
it &apos;s not gone out there in other countries .
"well , after all , the film has a very large <unk> <unk> ."
"it &apos;s not <unk> for a project where almost every <unk> we &apos;re talking to , <unk> their customer ."
"so something i &apos;m aware of , is that when you give up your opportunity to <unk> risks in those risks ."
"i believe when you get rid of it , then you <unk> them to fail ."
"i think that , if you train your employees to be able to avoid risks all the way you &apos;re prepared to get a profit ."
i feel like we have to <unk> people with <unk> .
we must make people <unk> not <unk> to have a fear to be in front of .
"finally , <unk> , we should welcome up to be <unk> ."
we should stick the bear in the <unk> .
will be my <unk> . welcome to <unk> the risk .
"each of us is a very <unk> , which is what we &apos;re <unk> the risk ."
"and finally , we should be calling transparency ."
"today , more than more than ever , we &apos;re getting a little bit of honesty ."
"and they said , with honesty and free , my <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> transparency , &quot; became inspired by my good friends of <unk> <unk> that was <unk> for the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> ."
large data is going to be brought up in the globe all of the world .
"<unk> <unk> : <unk> , they <unk> transparency ."
thank you .
"now , <unk> , in the names of transparency this : what is about the $ <unk> ?"
it &apos;s a great question .
"i was in my <unk> a <unk> , the <unk> on the <unk> &apos;s <unk> , the <unk> <unk> -- <unk> a <unk> in the altitude <unk> in for my <unk> in the next year , to fund my <unk> ."
my name is <unk> .
"i did a bit of a little bit about google , and i made <unk> , and making some art with <unk> and art . my <unk> , who now has been the green light ."
and it took 18 months .
"a lot of time and stories , i &apos;ll tell you that i can tell you about 17 very interesting <unk> from about nine countries ."
but i &apos;m going to look at the show .
we have plenty of stories in about why we have this .
i think my personal perspective is a very simple with this slide and explains it .
i grew up in india .
"i was great education -- not <unk> to me -- but i had too much , not too much of these kinds of <unk> and these <unk> ."
"when i went , and to visit those <unk> , i started to learn a bunch of learning ."
and while i was working for google i was trying to make these <unk> art <unk> -- <unk> art with technology .
"we then <unk> a team , which is a great <unk> , and we <unk> to the <unk> ."
"so i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and i &apos;m going to share some interesting things that have been <unk> since the conversation ."
so you just go back to <unk> .
you can just look around the <unk> . it can go back .
"there &apos;s the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , van <unk> ."
"i &apos;ll even start one in my favorite , the <unk> in new york city ."
"you get to two very , very , very simple ."
"and <unk> , <unk> , you &apos;re in the museum ."
"they don &apos;t matter where they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , it doesn &apos;t make a difference ."
they go around and they &apos;re <unk> and <unk> .
you want to <unk> in a museum ?
"open the map , and jump it with a <unk> ."
they &apos;re in <unk> ; they &apos;re up to the end of their <unk> .
it &apos;s just that . i &apos;m just a lot .
<unk> them .
"thank you , but the best thing is coming ."
"so , i &apos;ve come from one of my <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the <unk> ."
i see this <unk> .
"when the museum gave us an image , you throw it on ."
this is one from the pictures .
and that is all the <unk> .
"these of you , which are really interested in art , i can click on this one . i just <unk> this out now ."
this is one of the pictures we &apos;ve been <unk> with what the so-called <unk> of <unk> we &apos;ve called .
"for instance , this image is about 10 billion <unk> of <unk> , i think ."
"and a lot of other people ask me , &quot; what are you going to be <unk> for 10 billion <unk> ? &quot;"
"now let me show you this , right now ."
you can be very easily in and <unk> .
she looks some fun there .
and i love this guy : it &apos;s <unk> .
but then you really want to make sure deeply .
and so i started playing around around and i found that there &apos;s something going on .
"and i thought , &quot; well , this is interesting . &quot;"
"i went close to it , and i noticed that these children actually put something in it ."
"i had a little <unk> , had a couple of the <unk> , and actually some of the things which is about a game called <unk> <unk> at a <unk> with the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> with a <unk> ."
it seemed quite <unk> .
"i don &apos;t know why you did it , but i learned about this ."
"just to move close , you can get to keep your <unk> ."
"it &apos;s only to give you the <unk> of the <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> to get what you get ."
"here we are , and this is the painting ."
that &apos;s the best comes in by a second .
"and let &apos;s jump quickly to the <unk> , again , again in new york ."
"another shot picture i , <unk> ."
"so for the <unk> , it went about finding detail ."
but what if you want to see the <unk> of these things ?
and what if you want to see the van <unk> has created this <unk> thing ?
you put into it . you really can go into it .
"i will go through a picture of my <unk> , until i really get into the process of it ."
"this is <unk> , never seen before that ."
so i &apos;ll show you my very complicated function .
there are still many more other than i don &apos;t even have the time .
"so this is the really cool part , called <unk> ."
"all of you , everybody -- the same one -- poor or poor , if you &apos;re having a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter ."
you can create <unk> and <unk> your own museum and make them made of all of those pictures that can be <unk> your own collection .
"it &apos;s just that you go -- and i created that , it &apos;s called the power , it &apos;s the <unk> -- you can do it ."
"this is the most <unk> , the <unk> <unk> ."
"and you can put anything with <unk> to their friends , and you can start to begin a conversation about what you feel when you look at those <unk> ."
"and i thought , <unk> , is the most exciting stuff , which are all these wonderful things not coming from google . &quot;"
they are not going to take off my <unk> for not <unk> .
"i should say that , i should not say ."
so they come from the artists .
and that &apos;s an <unk> experience for me .
"i mean , i hope we &apos;ll be <unk> with a digital medium of art , and you &apos;re just online ."
so the main question is that the biggest question that i &apos;m asked is : are you doing this to try to <unk> the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer to that is no .
and it &apos;s supposed to experience that experience .
this is what it goes . thank you .
thank you .
this is a <unk> of her brain . its brain can grow up in two <unk> .
"this is the one half of the right side , and then the right is the right ."
"if we had a scale of measure the power of every hemisphere to land the hemisphere , you could be <unk> your brain ."
"for instance , that would be somebody who is completely <unk> ."
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive .
"now , where do you <unk> your brain on this scale ?"
"some of us would have chosen to give one of those <unk> , but i think that for most people in the audience , you know , their brain looks like this , with high <unk> that is in the same room that are in both <unk> ."
it &apos;s not as when they &apos;re both <unk> or so forth .
you can do it and be intuitive .
"and that &apos;s why i see , when one of the people in common with most different <unk> , that needs a good level of logic to bring the complex ideas together ."
"but at that same time , we need a good <unk> of <unk> , we actually have some more <unk> experiments ."
"how do we develop these <unk> ? now , we love with things ."
"so we go out and play it and then see how it responds , and we &apos;re going to develop into our <unk> ."
"and essentially , they do the same thing ."
"now , one of the most <unk> of these things that you evolved in years is probably that one thing can be at a place just at an age ."
"i mean , it can <unk> to think that one thing is at the same time in both different places , but they were <unk> to this idea of the idea of what they did not develop ."
but i remember seeing a kid playing a child .
"so he was another <unk> , and not very good at this , and he was constantly moving all the time ."
"but i bet that it works with an awful lot of this , which is that big stuff don &apos;t just take you , and it will be in a place ."
"and this is a <unk> <unk> model in the world , as long as you are not about ."
"it would be a <unk> model for not a <unk> , because it &apos;s not playing with video games , it would be with this little <unk> particles ."
"and if you play with your particles , they <unk> all sorts of different things -- as they fly straight through walls , or that they can be in the same time ."
and so they all kind of <unk> them up and called &quot; the theory of quantum mechanics . &quot;
"this was the law of physics to some years ago , you needed quantum mechanics to describe little bits of tiny particles ."
but you didn &apos;t need you to describe the big objects that are everyday objects around us .
"it didn &apos;t like that , and perhaps just because i &apos;m not so often with particles ."
"well , i just play with you , but i don &apos;t often like that ."
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
"i mean , nobody has ever seen one particles ever ."
but my <unk> site has not liked .
"because if all the things are made of <unk> and all the particles go through the mechanics of the quantum mechanics , then not just going through all rules , all the <unk> &apos;s mechanics ?"
i &apos;m not see why this shouldn &apos;t be like that .
so i would feel a lot better at it with all the way that if we might show out that <unk> also will <unk> the rules that quantum mechanics .
"so i made a few years ahead of this , just doing this ."
i created .
this is the first object you can see in the <unk> <unk> .
"so what we &apos;re looking back in here is a very , very <unk> computer ."
and you can see that green line where they &apos;re in the middle there .
this is the piece of <unk> that i &apos;m going to talk about .
that &apos;s a picture of the object .
here i &apos;m <unk> . we &apos;re looking at the center .
and this is a really very small <unk> of this small piece of metal .
"so one thing that we look at is a little metal metal metal and it is a kind of sort of <unk> , and it &apos;s about the <unk> ."
"so i made this thing in a way , which one makes a computer chip ."
i went to a clean space with new <unk> and <unk> for 100 hours to have on all the great devices .
"so i had to build my own machine for a little bit , and to make that a <unk> <unk> pool of hole and the object ."
"this thing has the ability to be in the <unk> <unk> , but it takes a little bit to do ."
let me give you an analogy .
you know how <unk> it <unk> with the <unk> &apos;s ?
"i mean , if i &apos;m alone in an elevator , then i do all the <unk> things , but then i &apos;ll take others and i hear them go to all these things , because i don &apos;t want them to go , or not <unk> , &quot; they say , &quot; i &apos;m <unk> ."
now quantum mechanics tells that <unk> objects are as well .
"the <unk> of <unk> objects are not just people but also the light which it seems to be and the wind coming up to them , and the heat up of that space ."
"and that &apos;s what we thought that if we wanted to see , this piece of metal is acting in , we had to take out the whole <unk> out of it ."
and we did .
"we <unk> the light up -- we put it into the air and the <unk> air and <unk> it from and almost until , it was <unk> to just alone , the piece of the metal was <unk> to the way the other thing wanted ."
so let &apos;s actually measure its movements .
we found that it is really strange .
"instead of just that it &apos;s simply being silent , it <unk> , like the way that it was <unk> , something -- like the <unk> and <unk> and each other ."
"in the fact that we gave it a small <unk> <unk> , we could <unk> it at the same time , not to turn it back to the <unk> , something that only allows us to <unk> into quantum mechanics ."
so what i just tell you about is that what &apos;s truly <unk> .
what about the same object in the same time <unk> and not to do it ?
and so let &apos;s think over the atoms .
"so , the first case , all the atoms of atoms that are <unk> of metal and they are still getting there and at the same time , same atoms move down and down ."
it &apos;s only too <unk> <unk> that makes you <unk> .
"they &apos;re in the rest of time , they &apos;re in terms of the <unk> sea ."
"and that means that each <unk> in the same time is at least two different places , which , at the same time , which is that all the piece of metal is at two different places ."
"i think that &apos;s right , that &apos;s very cool ."
really .
"this was the worth of <unk> for every year <unk> <unk> , but , check that <unk> between one single <unk> and this piece of metal and the piece of the piece of metal and you &apos;ve had ."
"so if a single <unk> <unk> in the same time can be two different locations , that piece of metal can be in two different locations of what &apos;s not you ?"
i mean -- this is all my <unk> page is just telling .
"so , imagine you would have to get to a time at several places , as that would go ?"
how would you have awareness that your body is in your room ?
there &apos;s another aspect about the story .
"when we <unk> it , the lights out , and <unk> , we saw it was just that <unk> metal was just there ."
"and so i had to develop this new kind of insight that it looks like everything is actually <unk> , in fact , are <unk> objects that are <unk> into a small room ."
so you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says that all it &apos;s related to everything .
now this is not really right .
there &apos;s more behind it . it &apos;s about a little deeper .
"so , it &apos;s that these compounds , the connections , their connections to all these things around them , literally define who they are are , and that is the most weird and strange of quantum mechanics ."
thank you so much .
"in the 2007 year , i decided that we should think that <unk> as we think about economic development ."
"it would be our goal of thinking that when family want to think about where they want and work and want them to give you the possibility in one single hand , between a different cities , which all in competition in new cities ."
right now we &apos;re far away from the <unk> .
there are billions of people in countries who don &apos;t even have one town that would be welcome to hot .
"the amazing thing about cities , is that they are more value than they &apos;re at the cost of building it ."
"so we could have the world a very simple way , perhaps <unk> from new cities ."
"now this sounds like <unk> to you , you never thought about new cities ."
you just go to building the apartments from where towns from the city are out .
"imagine , half of the people who want to live in their lives are already <unk> ; the other half of them don &apos;t ."
they might try to push the capacity of <unk> together .
but you know what they would have been going to get to these <unk> and their bodies <unk> <unk> and prevent the <unk> of the <unk> .
so it turns out that it <unk> to all the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> .
"but you could walk in a completely new place and build a whole new <unk> , and that they would support that would support and help a <unk> ."
"so i have <unk> that governments do new motion , that they have the place to give them a city and had a name : <unk> <unk> ."
"later , i found that about the same time , <unk> and <unk> over the challenge of a sudden <unk> in <unk> thought ."
"they knew that every year of 10,000 countries left their country to come to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people are in their own land , and they can be <unk> the same same ."
"and this one was told about <unk> , which what happens when we put a <unk> land of your country , if it just <unk> one message , a part of the american embassy , a part of the <unk> , and then , when it &apos;s the people could it <unk> to work people working , and then"
"in 2009 , <unk> had suffered from <unk> ."
"in the next <unk> elections , <unk> won <unk> in an <unk> <unk> whose program had both a <unk> , and his daughter &apos;s <unk> ."
it was asking <unk> to be a <unk> .
"in the meantime , i was <unk> at a talk talk about <unk> ."
"so through improvement , trying to take through the study of <unk> , i have tried to <unk> this idea of <unk> city that is what is mostly going to reduce elements ."
"first point , the importance of laws , laws , which determine that you don &apos;t actually have a <unk> to the <unk> ."
"we pay a new new technology for the <unk> , but for that progress will take it and laws , and they are usually the laws of laws that help us ."
"in 2010 , a friend of guatemala , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the ted tedtalk ."
the again he showed <unk> <unk> .
and they call me them the two .
"and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present the <unk> to your country ! &quot;"
"and so we met it in december <unk> , in december <unk> ."
"i tried to make <unk> about how valuable cities are , how much <unk> they &apos;re as it is for a cost ."
"and i used these <unk> to show how valuable it &apos;s in a place like new york . think of a space , in some cases , a field in some cases of a thousand thousand dollars ."
"but it was a pretty serious debate , at a point when we have been a <unk> , and said , &quot; paul , might , let we watch the tedtalk . &quot;"
"so the tedtalk in a very simple shape that a western city is a place , the beginning of the <unk> country , a <unk> , which is the laws of the <unk> and <unk> to their citizens or <unk> them , or also they also have a rule ."
"that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of <unk> that really thought we have to get this project is important , so that that &apos;s the way we &apos;re in order to bring this land ."
"i was asked to get to <unk> , and even once , i was to keep a <unk> talk , and fifth january ."
"so i &apos;ve been holding another <unk> talk , which has been a <unk> like this , which has tried to tell you that , if you want to do much value in a city , it has to become a huge city ."
"and it &apos;s a picture of the city , and <unk> <unk> the new airport , the new airport that &apos;s built in &apos; 50s ."
"so , at all of that airport , there has 100 <unk> ."
"so i &apos;ve tried to <unk> the <unk> of it when you &apos;re doing building a new city , you &apos;re going to start with one area of at least 1,000 people ."
that &apos;s over a thousand meters in this morning .
and you have all the <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very serious and very <unk> .
"and the <unk> of congress came to the stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you , you , i <unk> you for your talk , but maybe we could look at a tedtalk ."
i have this one in my laptop . &quot;
"so i <unk> , and you &apos;re having <unk> &apos;s tedtalk ."
and i came to the <unk> that there has a new city of people that have been <unk> to new opportunities .
"there would be the opportunity to live in one town in <unk> , rather than hundreds of miles away into the north ."
and there &apos;s a new city that <unk> also new ways of leader to <unk> with people .
"the <unk> of the government would have been to the help of <unk> , and they might be able to benefit from their <unk> to the code that they were able to support the laws of the law that could actually help them that <unk> <unk> that <unk> ."
and the realization of president <unk> was that the <unk> of the <unk> that i thought was when the building <unk> could be and build the city <unk> and <unk> could be <unk> for all of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> in many years of fear and many decades .
we &apos;ve gone in a area .
this image is from this place .
this was a thousand square square kilometer .
"and then soon , on the 19th , on january , they &apos;ve had a change on which the constitution <unk> to have an <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is for particular <unk> ."
"so in a country that just has a <unk> crisis behind congress , that &apos;s where the <unk> to this <unk> was <unk> to an honor ."
"all <unk> , all the people of society , they do <unk> it ."
"just to become a part of the constitution , the one has to be <unk> ."
"the last <unk> , it was <unk> to <unk> that <unk> were <unk> <unk> ."
"immediately , after the election , between the 21st of education and 24 to 24 / 11 , a <unk> rate of about 30 <unk> of the world , who are most interested in <unk> in the business ."
the place is south korea .
"this is a picture of a big , new <unk> <unk> that in south korea built big amounts of <unk> in south korea ."
"all you see at this image that was taken from four years ago , after it took four years out of the <unk> ."
"the other place that was very interested in the <unk> is , is <unk> ."
and they &apos;ve been brought two cities in china to <unk> and the third one is in <unk> .
"so , in virtually you &apos;re seeing this , that &apos;s where we &apos;re now ."
they &apos;ve already got a <unk> . and they &apos;ve already been able to do this area for a second city .
it &apos;s been working on to one legal system that allows the following <unk> and it &apos;s also done on a universal law .
"a country has already offered his <unk> <unk> to run , as a dish in charge , the <unk> <unk> for <unk> system ."
"and <unk> , too , are very interested ."
they &apos;re actually <unk> by <unk> .
"one thing you already know has been , you &apos;ve had a lot of <unk> ."
"there are many businesses that like to be <unk> in the united states , particularly in a place where you could live in <unk> , and there were many people like to live there ."
"all over the world , there are 700 million people who are <unk> by <unk> who like them to live on a different place on a different place ."
a million people leave one every year and <unk> the united states .
"and a lot of them are fathers , who &apos;s forced to get their families to get their family , and they might have <unk> mothers to make them and have access to food and buy clothing ."
"unfortunately , even though they are even children to try to find their parent , they have seen them in some cases since they &apos;ve been never seen for over the decade ."
"so , so what about an idea of thinking about building <unk> in <unk> to build a completely new city ?"
"or even <unk> from these cities , or hundreds out all over the world ?"
so what &apos;s this idea for the fact that every family has an option between cities <unk> to new research ?
that &apos;s an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
"my friends from <unk> asked me to say , thank you ."
"you know , how many decisions do you make in a typical day ?"
you know how many choices you meet in an <unk> week ?
"so i recently did a survey that was done with 2,000 <unk> , and it &apos;s an average number of choices , which is the average number of americans in one day is a <unk> ."
"in the <unk> , a recent study was done recently in the <unk> , who <unk> the <unk> for weeks ."
"and these scientists just &apos;ve been using all these various issues and which were <unk> to , and the <unk> were doing so much of the choices to meet people ."
"and they found out , a <unk> <unk> in a week , a <unk> <unk> work ."
"and every of these subjects were made of , many smaller decisions ."
and 50 percent of their decisions were made in every nine minutes or less .
"just for about 12 percent of their decisions , they <unk> an hour or more of their time ."
and think about your own decisions .
how many decisions you make them <unk> about the nine minutes of <unk> in the hour ?
"how good , do you think of , are you going to solve decisions ?"
"now i &apos;d like to talk about one of the great <unk> of our big time , the <unk> ."
"so i want to talk about the problem , and some of the solutions that are doing ."
"now when i talk about that issue , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to tell you about the answers ."
"if i ask you a question : raise you , because i am blind , only if you want to burn a bunch of calories ."
"but , i mean , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , and my first question is , is that the first question , are you ready to hear about the <unk> ?"
thank you .
"and when i was an <unk> at stanford university , i went to this very , very <unk> <unk> at at least when he was really a <unk> <unk> ."
"it was a shop , the <unk> , the <unk> ."
"this is a deal , it was as a <unk> ."
they had 250 types of mustard and <unk> and <unk> over over 500 types of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> over a couple of different species of water -- that was too <unk> when we were <unk> .
"i got it to that business , and i asked this business to you , but in a moment , i wondered , how do you ever make something wrong ?"
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had over 75 percent of the <unk> oil that were embedded in boxes who <unk> from a thousand years of old <unk> came .
"so i decided to visit one other day to visit my <unk> , and i asked the <unk> model that works , &quot; do you really , do you give the people all of those possibilities ? &quot;"
and he showed up the <unk> of <unk> <unk> that came everyday and used their cameras .
"so we decided to put together a experiment we chose , and we chose the <unk> for our experiment ."
here &apos;s your walking <unk> .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we made a little <unk> right to the nest maintenance workers .
"and we have six different <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , and we looked at <unk> different <unk> , and we &apos;ve looked at two things that i did , which case would i stay and <unk> ?"
"it &apos;s more people stayed than it was 24 , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent ."
and then we looked at one of what &apos;s going on was the people who were expecting some glass <unk> .
now we see this <unk> effect .
"and of us who stayed when it were 24 , only three percent actually made a glass ."
"people who were left when they were six and now , right now we saw that 30 percent of them would <unk> ."
"now , if you &apos;re <unk> it , people would have a sort of glass <unk> , and people who had six to <unk> when they had 24 to go to the <unk> ."
"and now , to buy a glass of <unk> <unk> is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our food -- but it turns out that the <unk> that it <unk> us very much more useful for very different <unk> ."
we don &apos;t decide to decide when it is <unk> your own best interests .
"so , the subject of the day , is saving ."
"i &apos;m going to describe to you now a study i did with <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , where we put the decisions for nearly a million <unk> of a number of <unk> <unk> <unk> from the country to the entire u.s. government ."
"and what we thought to us , though , was the number of <unk> that could be possible to make an <unk> plan that is the chance that will <unk> that more tomorrow ."
"and we found that , indeed , there was a context ."
so with these plans we had about <unk> plans that people were making anything between two to 59 <unk> fund that was going to happen .
"and what we found was that the longer fund were that , actually , that , actually , the participation was less at lower rate ."
"so if you look at the <unk> , the plans that were <unk> to two fund had a <unk> into the <unk> , not as high -- still as we want to ."
and the one of the rights that nearly 60 fund was <unk> that the <unk> was going to go about the <unk> <unk> .
"now it turns out , if you &apos;ve <unk> <unk> to <unk> , you have more opportunities to <unk> on the side to the <unk> , and then you &apos;ve got negative consequences in the <unk> ."
"and so the people that the people who decided to have their <unk> , the <unk> of them to give them more , the more they were <unk> to vote and fund fund to fund it ."
"the more opportunities are available , the more they were given to their money to <unk> their money into <unk> ."
"not these extreme decisions , to be heard of the decisions that somebody who <unk> to us when their most important <unk> is important to us ."
"now , over the last decade , we saw three basic effects that provide the value of more and more choice with it ."
"they make the decision <unk> -- they move to them , even as they &apos;re <unk> in their own best interest ."
they &apos;re getting more of worse decisions -- <unk> financial and worse health decisions .
they tend to make things that feel like less satisfied to yourself even when to make objective .
"so the key for this is that we might be able to look at these giant <unk> of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , but , actually , you can &apos;t take the <unk> and actually pick up the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"so what i &apos;d just like to share with you are four simple techniques -- the techniques that we have tested in different ways to be built for them in the various types , <unk> them ."
first : just <unk> .
"they &apos;ve heard that before , but it has never been true than today , less is more of it ."
"people are always <unk> if i say , &quot; <unk> . &quot;"
and you always worry that you lose your mind .
"but in fact , we see it always and more and more and more , if you &apos;re willing to <unk> , the <unk> will go out , well it &apos;s going to be a <unk> rise , it &apos;ll be <unk> ; it &apos;s a &amp; amp ; and <unk> ; and <unk> &amp; <unk> &amp; <unk> ;"
"<unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> species of 26 across 15 , <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> at 10 percent ."
"as the golden <unk> , their 10 of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> that profit <unk> percent of a <unk> percent -- one of the two , of the <unk> increase in the <unk> costs of <unk> ."
"you know , the average <unk> here today , <unk> them up to the other products ."
"a typical <unk> is <unk> today 100,000 products ."
"but the fundamental <unk> <unk> of the world , the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world is <unk> , and they only provide only <unk> products -- a kind of <unk> <unk> ."
"now in the world of <unk> , i believe one of the best examples that we &apos;ve come in in there are the best the election , was the choice -- a thing that david was a very powerful , she offered in the <unk> program ."
"any students who &apos;s taking care now , automatically <unk> at a <unk> ."
"well , <unk> who will really want a <unk> meeting will be fund 20 fund , not about 300 or 300 ."
"you know , how people often say , &quot; don &apos;t know how to <unk> ."
there are all important possibilities . &quot;
"and the one , the first thing i think i call the employees is , &quot; tell me how they tell me about other parts ."
"and when they can &apos;t <unk> them , it doesn &apos;t have their customers . &quot;"
"now , before we started to have <unk> , i had a conversation with gary ."
and gary told that he would be willing to give all people in this audience to have a legal national <unk> on the world of the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read you the read .
"and now let me give you a couple of seconds to read them and please ask them , and so i &apos;d like to <unk> it , if you &apos;re <unk> gary &apos;s <unk> ."
okay . all the ready . so everybody &apos;s <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
all are they ?
"okay , let me show you something more ."
"they knew it was a task , right ?"
now who &apos;s ready for that journey .
and i think i &apos;ve probably heard some more hands .
good .
"in fact , they were looking at information <unk> , when i first had a <unk> of information when the second time , but i would guess what it was that they were doing it in the other times more ."
because they <unk> the images to feel it for <unk> .
"what brings me to the second technique that helps you <unk> them with the problem of the <unk> , that &apos;s the problem we &apos;re doing ."
"the idea is that people who need to know the difference between ways , the consequences of what is associated with their potential opportunities , and that <unk> <unk> are really <unk> and <unk> ."
"why do humans spend <unk> <unk> <unk> percent more on one , if they use a <unk> or a card <unk> than <unk> ?"
because it doesn &apos;t feel <unk> to make money .
and it turns out that if you make something <unk> feel like it is a very good tool for saving people to save more .
"so we had one study i made with <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve made a study with <unk> -- <unk> employees that were all working for <unk> -- and these people were <unk> them in a shop in your own business for their <unk> ."
"and while this meeting , we have these meeting exactly as they were , we just went to <unk> a <unk> ."
"the <unk> that we had <unk> in , was that people asked , just to think about the positive and the difference that would be going to live in their lives if they would save money ."
"so we did this simple thing , and they had a rise of the <unk> of 20 percent over 20 , and there was going to go over to about the number of people who had to go in for four to a <unk> <unk> of them ."
the third technology -- <unk> .
we can do better <unk> more than more choices .
so here &apos;s one study that we made in an <unk> .
"turns into the <unk> industry up to the north area , and down in the northeast , <unk> <unk> of various <unk> <unk> to <unk> magazines by the very different <unk> of <unk> papers ."
but do you know what ?
"when i &apos;ll show you 600 magazines and they <unk> them into 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , and they &apos;ll believe that i <unk> them more and more food <unk> to a million and a better person i would have a 400 to have over them ."
because the categories tell me what i can keep them from .
here are two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and it says the word <unk> . &quot;
"you think the left here is <unk> , and the ad on the right , then you put the <unk> , you &apos;ll <unk> them in the hands ."
"okay , we &apos;ll be a couple ."
"if you think that that &apos;s on the left , the one that &apos;s on the right side , and it &apos;s <unk> on , please <unk> ."
"ok , a bunch more ."
"well , it turns out that they have right ."
"the one on the left is jazz , and the ones on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?"
that &apos;s a strong high school .
"categories have to say something about the <unk> , not the <unk> <unk> for <unk> ."
"and the problem is often , when you look at the long list of these fund all fund ."
who is that they want to make this <unk> ?
my fourth technique : <unk> to complexity .
"well it turns out , in fact , that we can deal with more information than we think we have to be able to simplify it ."
we need to <unk> the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you one example of what i mean .
"let &apos;s take a very , very <unk> choice : a buy of a car ."
here &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that makes you an opportunity to take your car entirely .
you &apos;ve got to make different choices to make your car fully .
now these choices are different to the number of choices they have to make up each choice .
"<unk> , <unk> of the <unk> -- i have a very different opportunities ."
"motors , <unk> -- four possibilities ."
so what i &apos;m doing now is i have <unk> the order of decisions in which .
"and half of the clients is going to be <unk> by many possibilities for <unk> the <unk> possibilities , four ."
"the other half of clients is going to be <unk> , four <unk> , to the <unk> <unk> , many options ."
what do i &apos;m going to look at ?
as they &apos;re interested in .
"so whenever you use the <unk> of the decision to make it , that &apos;s because you &apos;re being more <unk> , i &apos;m going to lose it ."
"what &apos;s it , it &apos;s that the people who go from many to the <unk> and always <unk> the <unk> again and all over the time ."
we lose them .
"go from the little choice for you to the many of the most , keep them in the same place ."
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of options .
and the only thing that i did is to do is change the sequence of what it is actually <unk> in this thing .
"when i do with the easy <unk> , i study how to <unk> ."
"even though the same thing , even though the <unk> pick me , i tell me about nothing about my preferences , the <unk> is still <unk> me ."
"it makes me <unk> to the big product that i &apos;m <unk> to , and i &apos;m so happy to be ready with me ."
let me <unk> you .
i told you of four techniques that give the <unk> problem <unk> <unk> -- <unk> the <unk> to go . <unk> do it real ; <unk> -- we can make it more <unk> by more categories and more of complexity .
"so every one of these techniques i thought i &apos;m now <unk> to help you the possibilities for , you guys , you can use , well , to do good for yourself , for people who are providing to services ."
"and i think the key to best best is to be , in the <unk> , you know , that &apos;s a <unk> ."
"and the more we &apos;re <unk> in choose , the better we &apos;re going to be able to make the art of the decision ."
thank you .
"sorry . i &apos;m <unk> kevin <unk> , <unk> at youtube . watch i <unk> ."
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how video are being <unk> and then by why it &apos;s important .
"we all want stars to be so ... <unk> , <unk> -- as a young i was to be so <unk> difficult to ."
"but video video has allowed all of you , or all of your creative <unk> , <unk> , we have to be <unk> by part of the culture of our world ."
each one of you might be famous to the internet to the next <unk> .
but over <unk> is getting more than 48 hours per minute to <unk> .
"again , it will only take a huge percentage of <unk> and <unk> thousands and so on a <unk> of cultural present ."
so how does it work ?
"and <unk> things : <unk> , unexpected and the unexpected thing ."
well let &apos;s do it again .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> : <unk> !
"last year , <unk> <unk> took this video that he was <unk> at his house in a high <unk> ."
"2010 , it was taken 23 million times ."
and this graph shows how it looked like the video last summer for the first time in front of it .
"in fact , don &apos;t want to make a <unk> video ."
he wanted to only share with a <unk> .
"because you just do that , when you get to land <unk> ."
he had <unk> <unk> <unk> to the day .
and this video has been actually done on january in <unk> .
what &apos;s on that point ?
there came jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> : the <unk> that made the video from the past so <unk> .
"because <unk> such as jimmy treating jimmy and <unk> make us new stuff , and they show you a big audience ."
"<unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . &apos; <unk> <unk> -- you didn &apos;t think you would have that conversation with this <unk> ."
rebecca <unk> + <unk> is one of the last week &apos;s video games .
it was seen almost 200 times in that year .
and so the graph looked like that .
"just as in <unk> <unk> , there seems that it doesn &apos;t come out of it ."
what happened that day ?
"well , it was friday . that &apos;s true ."
"if you know , those other <unk> are also <unk> ."
"but what about this day , that particular friday ?"
"well , <unk> <unk> started putting a lot of people <unk> about it ."
michael <unk> : for his <unk> theater was one of one who made on twitter <unk> .
"it &apos;s important to make a <unk> or a group from <unk> to an <unk> point , with a great audience and so to put the process ."
"and then this community , of the people who shared these big <unk> , and started to talk about them and begin to use it ."
"now there are 10,000 million of <unk> from the <unk> ."
there was a <unk> <unk> for each <unk> .
"different from the <unk> of the 20th century , the community is part of our community to become part of this phenomenon , or by <unk> , we &apos;ll get it out of or do a new thing ."
and this is a piece called the <unk> and it &apos;s animation in <unk> .
"so here &apos;s , it &apos;s very simple ."
"this year , almost 50 million times a look at this year ."
"and if you think about that in <unk> you &apos;re talking about that , it &apos;s a <unk> that has been looked at four million times ."
even cats actually look at this video .
cats are looking at cats that look at this video .
"and it &apos;s important for creativity , the creativity in the <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> ."
there were <unk> .
someone did an <unk> version of it .
and it became international .
an entire of a <unk> <unk> out of the soil made this joke from a <unk> <unk> to something that we can all participate in .
"now today , we don &apos;t just find <unk> to something with it ."
"who could have that , you know ?"
who have <unk> <unk> &apos;s &quot; or rs or rs <unk> can <unk> ? &quot;
"what can the writing can <unk> your writing , which <unk> to those ?"
"one in the world , in the minute of two days , is <unk> <unk> , can only be <unk> and <unk> just like the video i showed ."
"so i &apos;m not a very interested in my friend , as i asked a friend to watch this great video , about a <unk> <unk> in new york against <unk> ."
"i got a <unk> <unk> because i &apos;m not on the <unk> but , in fact , they &apos;re a <unk> that <unk> <unk> not on top of their own gas ."
"this is just a surprisingly <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> and looked at 5 5 ."
that approach is true for all the new . it &apos;s creative .
and that is what that brings us to the big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
"<unk> , creative <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of a new kind of media and culture , and of each has access to each one &apos;s in the audience ."
"and as i said , one of the largest stars -- <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , took his first point of youtube ."
nobody has to give your ideas of light .
and we &apos;re all feeling as <unk> of the <unk> of our culture today .
"and those are not the <unk> of the old media and they don &apos;t even meet the media from today , but they are going to determine the conversation of the future ."
thank you .
"how can i talk about the connection between my women and about three generations in their own life <unk> of a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> when she shares about 30 years ago , and her <unk> <unk> her mother and her mother and five years of her sister in her baby , in her <unk> , and she"
history is not since .
it &apos;s an <unk> ; she &apos;s still <unk> .
i want to tell you about some of those who are <unk> .
imagine the first piece : one guy who &apos;s <unk> his <unk> .
"it &apos;s a <unk> , a writer , a man , who <unk> the whole life of the simple hope of <unk> and freedom of its own <unk> ."
"do you think it <unk> to the <unk> in <unk> eyes , as he has to come up to see that his life was a single <unk> ."
"the words , long as his own friends , now <unk> his own ."
he moved back in silence .
"he died , broken through history ."
it &apos;s my grandfather .
i have never <unk> him .
but our lives are more than our own <unk> .
my grandmother never <unk> me to live life .
"and i had to worry that it was not <unk> , and it &apos;s been my job to learn that history actually did to try and <unk> us and come out of <unk> ."
"the next one , as a boat <unk> , was still <unk> in the sea ."
"my mother may have gone up to 18 , as she died -- already in an <unk> marriage , already with two little girl ."
"for her , her had been an <unk> , the <unk> of her family , and an new life in australia ."
it was totally <unk> that it could <unk> to <unk> .
"after a <unk> and <unk> , a boat <unk> <unk> to the lake , as <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
all adults were aware of the risk .
"the biggest <unk> , they had <unk> and <unk> and death ."
as most adults on my boat had a little <unk> in my own <unk> .
"so when i had my sister &apos;s father , and i &apos;d like to <unk> it and my grandmother from ."
"my first <unk> are from the boat -- the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , of any wave to the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the amount of <unk> and blank ."
"and i &apos;m not remember the <unk> that many times the many times , but from the death <unk> of the men on the boat , or on the <unk> of the <unk> , the six hours didn &apos;t want to go ."
"but i remember the lights of <unk> <unk> , and after the young man , the chief <unk> and died -- the end of the journey was too much of the train and the fire of the first <unk> ."
none is it ever <unk> so again .
three months ago in an refugee refugee <unk> we were <unk> .
and the next thing is the next <unk> is four women &apos; three generations that build out together a new life .
"we <unk> our <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the population <unk> from <unk> ."
"unlike the <unk> that i was completely unknown , there was no one in <unk> ."
the rest of the food chain was coming from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> <unk> were <unk> between the people who had a thing in common . they <unk> .
"my mom &apos;s been working on farms , and then on a <unk> in <unk> , six days , <unk> layers ."
"and they were sort of <unk> the time , <unk> and <unk> <unk> ."
we were poor .
"every dollar has been given to action and had <unk> in english and mathematics , no what we had to <unk> on the site , most of what the new things we had to come out of the second thing was always ."
"two <unk> for school , each one to try to <unk> those holes ."
"a <unk> to the <unk> , because she needed to be six years ."
"and then , they were the rare but <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from &quot; and there , and there &apos;s a <unk> , &quot; go home . &quot;"
from home .
something <unk> me in .
"there was a meeting meeting , and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go off of that way . &quot;"
"my mother , my brother and i sat in a <unk> ."
"my mom was a night and <unk> , but we told each one of our day , and heard the movements of our mission in our house ."
my mother died by the boat .
"and i mean to leave , you with all night , every day you came from until you come to the <unk> , so i could let it <unk> ."
they took a business <unk> and then they did a business store and they did it with a business .
"and the women had come with the stories about men who were not <unk> changing , angry , and <unk> , and <unk> kids were caught between two worlds ."
and <unk> and <unk> were searching for .
centers were built on the place .
i was inside <unk> .
"and in one of them , i was the <unk> student student who <unk> himself ."
"in the other hand , i was involved in the most recent lives of <unk> violence <unk> <unk> the <unk> of violence , the <unk> and the <unk> ."
and so many years of the help were helping .
"and because this help , i was given to the <unk> <unk> as young artist in my last year ."
"and i got back to one of the new <unk> of the next one , and the <unk> did not form the <unk> <unk> ."
"<unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , was now <unk> , refugee refugee , refugee <unk> , and social <unk> that was invited to speak to places that she &apos;d never heard of , in <unk> , and the existence she could never imagine ."
i didn &apos;t know about the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to do the <unk> .
i couldn &apos;t know how to speak about wine .
"so , i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything ."
"i wanted to go back in the village and the <unk> of the lifetime of a mother &apos;s <unk> back -- an grandmother and two daughters , and <unk> every one of your days like <unk> them for each of their last and three , we would not <unk> ."
"i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that ."
"and they reminded me that so , what was like that old , i said , when we had the boat to do that boat ."
no had never been a opportunity .
"&quot; do it . &quot; and she said , &quot; and wouldn &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;"
"and so i talked about <unk> <unk> and education , and the <unk> and the <unk> ."
"and so i talked about it , the more i should tell ."
"i met people in all sorts of <unk> so many of them did what they loved , the limits of the possible ."
"and although i was aware , i realized i could not <unk> my career in law ."
there had to give another <unk> .
"and i realized at the same time that okay , this is a <unk> , a <unk> , new , new in the image -- not just right , but something you must be grateful for , perhaps you , maybe a real gift of the <unk> ."
"because <unk> <unk> can lead so easily to collapse , like that , that you make the <unk> of space ."
"i &apos;ve come to know that enough of my <unk> was to know that <unk> , the world , not like <unk> ."
possibilities that not had been allowed were <unk> to do that are <unk> .
"there was a energy that has a <unk> optimism , an odd strange <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of <unk> ."
so i put in the experiences .
i put a little bit of people to come in and me that the <unk> won &apos;t be <unk> by the <unk> challenge .
we had no email for a year .
"by the end of every day , i gave a huge <unk> soup we shared ."
we worked late until the night .
"most of our ideas were angry , but there was a little bit of <unk> around it , and we could get the <unk> ."
i met the decision to draw .
just a journey there .
i <unk> that back .
"three months later , i was moved , and i kept going to the adventure ."
now i want to share with you before i tell you my grandmother .
"she grew up in a time , in <unk> the social norm and the local person were <unk> the most important person ."
it didn &apos;t change for centuries since <unk> .
her father died in a time after her born .
her mother moved on to her .
"and with 17 , she was born by the second woman of a mom whose mother was called her ."
"without <unk> &apos;s <unk> her husband made her for a <unk> to put it out to court and was on her own case , and a bigger <unk> <unk> , a winning war ."
&quot; don &apos;t go back as <unk> .
i just took a <unk> to a <unk> hospital when she died ; <unk> miles off .
i looked through the <unk> and saw it on the other hand .
"what i knew was , was she to get out there ."
my mother was a few minutes then after that .
"a couple days later , we went to <unk> a buddhist <unk> in <unk> and sat around her <unk> ."
"we told her stories , and <unk> that we had a lot more to her ."
"to get away in the <unk> , he said , he was going to be <unk> up ."
my mother asked us to get your hand <unk> .
"and she asked , &quot; why is your hand so <unk> , and the rest of them is so cold ? &quot;"
"&quot; because they &apos;ve been doing this day in the morning , &quot; he said ."
&quot; they didn &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
"when we &apos;re in our family , there &apos;s an <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> over women ."
"so you see who we were and shaped like the life , we can now see that the men who could come in with our lives , have come to us in <unk> ."
the <unk> would have been too simple .
"now i would have my own kids , and i think about the boat ."
who would ever wish one ?
"yeah . i &apos;m afraid of <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
"can i give you one <unk> in her life , the <unk> wave of every wave , the <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> , the big horizon , which will not be safe ."
i don &apos;t know .
"but if i could have that , and it could make sure of it , i could ."
"<unk> , <unk> is today in the fourth , fifth series ."
i &apos;m here to share with them my photography .
is it just photography ?
"because of course , that &apos;s a picture that you can &apos;t be <unk> with your camera ."
"and yet , my role of photography , when i received my first camera , at age 15 ."
"i <unk> it to drawing my <unk> at the <unk> , but it was a little bit different , but the camera actually was the <unk> of planning ."
"and as you move a painting with a camera , it <unk> the process that <unk> you down on a <unk> ."
so it really seems like i was <unk> to just stand at the right place in the right time .
i believed everyone could .
"so i wanted to create something else , which starts the process , if that <unk> will become more <unk> ."
and photos like this : a site along a much more <unk> road .
but it has an unexpected <unk> .
and still <unk> a very <unk> plane .
"or , just like these -- and <unk> and <unk> <unk> , but the whole thing with the common goal , to keep a <unk> plane ."
"if i say reality , i hate my <unk> ."
"because of course , she &apos;s not something that you can really capture , but i would always like this as if they could have that , in a photograph ."
photos you &apos;ve got to think of a moment you &apos;ve got to figure out to figure out the trick .
"so , it &apos;s rather about <unk> , an <unk> , as a really moment ."
so what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about that <unk> and the colors ?
is it about the lights ?
what does the illusion effect ?
sometimes your perspective is the illusion .
"but in the last part , it &apos;s all about how we &apos;re <unk> the world , and how they are <unk> on a <unk> area ."
"it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but we &apos;re realistic to it as realistic ."
so i think the <unk> really are very simple .
"and i see it as an absolute reality that you can take different parts of the way to put <unk> , to make an alternative reality ."
and let me show you a simple example of it .
"we have three physical objects of physical objects , which , we can all identify with the world in three-dimensional world ."
"but in a specific way , you can create a thing that would still look more <unk> than whether it was ."
"but in the same time , we know that that this is not possible ."
"and so , we <unk> our brains because we just just didn &apos;t think it makes a sense ."
and i see the same process through the photos of photos .
it &apos;s really simply about putting different <unk> .
"so the things i think will make for an image , i think that are things that we &apos;re going not thinking about , that stuff around our lives in our lives ."
"if we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to think about it because otherwise they can just get them wrong with it ."
so i &apos;d say it &apos;s got three simple rules to get a <unk> to get an impossible outcome .
"you can &apos;t see , they &apos;re not three special images ."
"but <unk> , you can create something like this ."
so the first one is that <unk> photos should have the same perspective on them .
second one is the same <unk> that was <unk> .
"and these two images <unk> them from the same altitude , from the very same <unk> and the same <unk> ."
three is a thing to do not make it possible to separate where the individual images started and end by <unk> their <unk> .
it &apos;s not possible to say how the photograph has actually been <unk> .
"so in <unk> color , contrast to the <unk> of individuals <unk> to the individual <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> colors and <unk> , we can let the limits between various images and the individual <unk> of a shot , including a typical picture ."
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that &apos;s just one thing and the top is becoming part <unk> .
"this image is entirely <unk> , out of photographs of different places ."
and i personally think that it can be easier to create a place where you don &apos;t have to go through the ideas in your mind .
but it requires lots and planning .
"and when i had that idea at winter , i knew that i &apos;d need several months to plan them to have the different places that are <unk> the pieces of the <unk> ."
"for example , fish had been taken on a coral ."
the bank is from a different place .
the <unk> is from an <unk> .
"and i actually put this house up on the island , actually , up of red , just to let it <unk> <unk> ."
"and to do a tool , it goes from me to planning beyond planning ."
"i &apos;ve always been to start with a <unk> idea , one idea ."
this is about the combination of different pictures .
and this is just a bit <unk> .
"and when you get good footage , it &apos;s kind of as beautiful , it &apos;s rather serious ."
"so it &apos;s all the tools that are all the tools , and the only thing that we do , this is the imagination ."
thank you .
"i &apos;d love to <unk> with you why so many electronic <unk> , i would have been growing up there ."
but i think the most important thing to do is we stopped talking about patients .
and one of the things that we <unk> in the <unk> was a <unk> <unk> .
"it &apos;s not a science story , it &apos;s about -- it &apos;s not <unk> a cup of coffee and you ask , you ask the patients , <unk> and how are we in it ?"
how can we help you ? &quot;
"and we thought we think that &apos;s one of the biggest one of the main reasons why you know most of the treatment , maybe most of the electronic <unk> , because that we &apos;ve left <unk> ."
"that one of my <unk> is , i &apos;m very simple stuff ."
"it has a button , like this ."
and i put that every morning .
"and yes , i have a task , as you may recognize ."
i &apos;ve got my task to 80 <unk> .
"it &apos;s just a simple thing , and every time i do it on the <unk> , it just suggests that i &apos;m looking at the data , you &apos;ve got to google ."
"and then they get <unk> by my <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> is , not just the moment where i &apos;m going to be in the moment or need , but also in a view of the past ."
"you know , there is something more ."
"maybe you know the familiar one , i have over 4,000 <unk> to twitter ."
"so , every morning i &apos;m going to spend my <unk> and the people already talk with me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; just to lunch just give you a little bit of a little <unk> <unk> today . &quot;"
"but it &apos;s what can happen because this is the <unk> , because that &apos;s how the <unk> can be done , to help patients because that could get applied to patients , or it might <unk> patients to <unk> the <unk> ."
"but there might be used to get people from their <unk> <unk> , and getting them to play together some kind of game in order to <unk> their health to control ."
and a week after that &apos;s going to happen .
"there &apos;ll be a little <unk> of that little <unk> for an iphone , or so on ."
"and it will allow people to measure their <unk> in home to give him up , giving him for some more than something more than 100 dollars ."
"so in this point , the patient will come back , you can &apos;t just take over the control of <unk> , a captain at your own ship , you can also help us , for health care in the future , and the national <unk> , and the <unk> ."
do you make the methods that are easy to use and begin with them to <unk> patients in a team .
"and you can get them through these kinds of techniques , but also by <unk> ."
"and the things we did , i would like to share with you a little video ."
we all have <unk> in our cars .
even in our cell cell .
we know exactly where all the <unk> are <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
and we know one thing where all <unk> are .
"and yeah , we can figure out ."
but what would the next <unk> to help this patient have to help ?
"we have <unk> , and nobody knew it ."
nobody knows where the next <unk> <unk> <unk> is at that time .
so what did we do ? we did <unk> in the <unk> .
"we have a <unk> website , and we have a <unk> company , and we &apos;ll have a <unk> , and then you &apos;ll share with you , and when he &apos;s on where he &apos;s on , &quot; because he &apos;s <unk> , of course , as well ."
"and over 10,000 <unk> were already in the <unk> ."
the next to this is to find apps for this .
and we have an enormous <unk> .
"we have developed an app for the <unk> , <unk> <unk> reality to find those online parts ."
"and if you are in a town like <unk> and you can use it , you can use your iphone and then you can look at your <unk> for the next few weeks , to see the <unk> that will save the next year ."
"and we &apos;re going to end this now with this , as <unk> , as the product of it does , but as <unk> , too ."
and we &apos;d like to give that on global space .
"and we ask our colleagues throughout the world , from other universities , to help to help us to behave as <unk> to the <unk> of the world around the world ."
"and if they &apos;re in <unk> , somebody &apos;s in a <unk> way , it &apos;s your way you can find it differently ."
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies are helping us all over the world for <unk> of that <unk> .
"this could be a <unk> , or <unk> , for example only to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still standing in its position ."
"please help us , and try to improve health , not to just improve the health , to take it out ."
thank you .
"today , i &apos;m going to share of <unk> discovery ."
i work at the <unk> store .
"and my little <unk> , i want that we &apos;re going to go to the environment and make it ."
"i mean , he had this <unk> to <unk> ."
here &apos;s a short video on what we do .
oh .
it might take it to be <unk> until it &apos;s .
now -- we &apos;re simply going to do this out -- i &apos;m going to take a picture of that out .
no .
this is not <unk> .
okay .
<unk> is ...
"oh , my time is around , right ?"
okay . thank you .
"so a couple of years ago , i started a program to get the stars and design in technology and get a year and to come back in a environments that actually do quite as a very , as you hate it . &quot;"
the program in the code for <unk> to code and it is sort of like the <unk> for <unk> .
"we &apos;re wearing some <unk> every year , and we &apos;re working with <unk> ."
"instead of sending you to the west , you send them to <unk> ."
"so they &apos;ve developed a great apps , working with urban <unk> ."
but actually what they &apos;re real to do is to show what is possible with technology .
so they make <unk> .
the <unk> is a space <unk> in the boston city .
"and here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a <unk> , but what he really <unk> is somebody who &apos;s <unk> it when he &apos;s <unk> , because he knows it &apos;s not too good at the <unk> <unk> when he <unk> a meter ."
how did he find that particular way to search for help ?
we had this team last year in boston the <unk> project for program program program .
"they got it in the <unk> , they have been <unk> much more <unk> ."
and it realized that the town never put up this fire <unk> up .
"but a <unk> <unk> , an <unk> man named <unk> <unk> , still had something else and that was that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be right across those ."
"so he did what everybody was doing for a good <unk> , he wrote an app ."
and there &apos;s a <unk> app to where to be a fire .
you get it out <unk> to <unk> if it &apos;s <unk> .
"if they &apos;re doing that , and you can give it a name , and he called it first <unk> ."
"when you don &apos;t do that , somebody can give it a <unk> ."
so there &apos;s a nice small <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> small app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest amount of apps that have written the <unk> in last year .
but she doesn &apos;t make something that does not touch .
it goes up slowly .
"there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> &apos; <unk> <unk> , who has seen that app , he would use this app , not for snow <unk> ."
"it &apos;s very important to realize that these <unk> work , but they <unk> the people <unk> ."
so he got the citizens to watch them .
and then seattle decided to use seattle to <unk> the company to clean the local <unk> <unk> behavior .
and the chicago has just introduced it to the people who are <unk> their <unk> when they &apos;re <unk> it .
"we know about nine cities , the planning to use this app ."
"and it <unk> <unk> , of course , <unk> , of course ."
"if you &apos;re <unk> about <unk> , you know , it doesn &apos;t usually do that ."
the software of <unk> takes a few years into rule .
"we had a team working last year in boston , and we started working on three and a half months ."
and it went to do a method for the parents can figure out what the real public schools in their children are .
"and it &apos;s been told later that if it was about the normal <unk> , it would took over two years , and it would be about two million dollars ."
and there &apos;s nothing yet .
"there are a project right now in the <unk> law , that &apos;s the most expensive for two billion dollars , and this is not working ."
and there are projects like this on a level of government .
"so an app which is written in a few days , and then spreading from <unk> , it &apos;s sort of a kind of <unk> to the <unk> institution on the government ."
"she shows how the government might work better -- not anymore as a business company , as a <unk> company , to think about it ."
"and not once the <unk> , and rather like the internet itself ."
"and that means open to free , that means open , <unk> productive ."
and that &apos;s important .
"but more recent of that app is that they &apos;re represented an new generation that is the problem of <unk> <unk> -- not as an <unk> institution as an environmental institution , but in a <unk> problem , <unk> ."
"and this is a very good thing , because it &apos;s a very good way of us to do very well in <unk> with digital technology ."
"and now we have a great public community , where we do the tools that we need to make things <unk> together ."
"it &apos;s not just &quot; code &quot; for <unk> , there are hundreds of people all over the country who are up and up and <unk> write each day in their own communities ."
they don &apos;t given the government .
"they &apos;re <unk> <unk> with their , but they &apos;re not <unk> over , they &apos;re <unk> ."
and those people know something we had lost from the eyes .
"and that &apos;s , if you can take the experience about policy and the <unk> at the head and all the other things we really come back about is the government , the essence of &apos; tim , &quot; we can do in tim <unk> , what do this . &quot;"
"today , a lot of people has <unk> government ."
"and if you &apos;re at one of those people , let me tell you that you &apos;re about to do it because the things change you ."
the politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and then the government finally <unk> its force -- to make you <unk> up : &quot; we will affect the people ? &quot; -- how do we think about this change as that change is happening .
now i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
"and as many people , i thought that it &apos;s largely about people in government ."
"so then i came up with this two years ago that , especially with <unk> , <unk> ."
this is the <unk> for service and information .
there you usually go out if you put in your town .
if you have to have an opportunity to work in your <unk> and work in the way our <unk> scott <unk> was <unk> as part of the program -- indeed they do all -- you will see that all the people who call a series of different issues .
now scott is going to get these <unk> .
he <unk> &quot; <unk> in the database .
and it has not really a idea . it starts with the <unk> .
"and ultimately , he says , &quot; look , you can simply open all the doors to your house and see pretty bad music and see whether the livestock are ? &quot;"
and it worked . and for scott .
but it &apos;s not the end of <unk> .
boston is not not just an english system .
"it has an application , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;"
we did not have written the app .
that &apos;s the work of <unk> people in the office of the new <unk> industry .
"one day -- that &apos;s a <unk> report -- that came in , &quot; <unk> in my pocket . can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s dead ."
"so , how do i get them off ? &quot;"
"but what happens to you , with <unk> <unk> is different ."
scott <unk> <unk> to human being .
"but in the <unk> , there is everything <unk> , so everyone can see ."
"and in that case , there was a <unk> ."
"and the next thing we get <unk> , i went there over there , i found the next <unk> ."
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
the <unk> was on the site . went home .
"great night , <unk> <unk> ."
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital <unk> .
and it &apos;s a good example of how <unk> government to get .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i &apos;m not necessarily necessarily <unk> a <unk> definition of the platform .
so i &apos;m actually talking about a platform for the people to help themselves and help to help other .
"one citizens would help another citizen , but the government has played the key role here ."
they connected these two people .
"and they would have <unk> to <unk> them if they had been required for that , and yet a <unk> is a far better and <unk> alternative to service ."
"so if we can do a <unk> <unk> of this other , we <unk> our communities ."
"we call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money ."
one of the most important stuff is we need to think about it is because there is no the same thing to politics .
"and most people are understanding this , but you think it &apos;s one of the other things that they are the most <unk> of the others ."
that &apos;s the thing that we need to make the system .
"how often we <unk> <unk> a political <unk> -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy , to pick a new political leaders -- and <unk> and we expect ourselves and we expect the government , and then our values will have changed , the values and our needs ."
"this is , because government has to be a bit more and policies , which are the <unk> <unk> ."
"and what it is below is , what we call of bureaucracy ."
and we use this word with <unk> .
"it &apos;s the <unk> that we &apos;ve <unk> that the thing we &apos;re having , and we pay for something to be , to work with us , something that is working on our own , and we &apos;re going to be something else ."
people seem to think politics is sexy .
"and as you want this institution to work for us , we must make sexy , so we &apos;ve gotten sexy ."
because this is where the real reality is going .
we need to be in the government &apos;s <unk> by it .
"so , the <unk> did ."
did you see these guys ?
"there &apos;s a group of <unk> citizens who wrote a very <unk> <unk> film , the answer to <unk> over the <unk> is <unk> ."
"that &apos;s not politically <unk> , that &apos;s active active ."
"now for those of us that the government has given up , the time is we think about what the world will we want to leave our kids ."
i mean you have to imagine the enormous challenges they have to imagine .
believe we really believe that we have to get what we need to do without improve the institution that can be done in their action ?
"the government is absolutely necessary , but it &apos;s got to be <unk> ."
the good news is that technology is able to <unk> that <unk> of the government is fundamentally possible in ways that can actually reach something by society by .
"and there &apos;s a generation of <unk> that &apos;s <unk> on the internet , and the <unk> knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do stuff , and it &apos;s just to build the right systems ."
"and the point of our <unk> is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost more generation than most of you are ."
this is one generation that grew up so <unk> to see their voice as of course as the <unk> .
"they &apos;re not fighting these <unk> , <unk> , who we all fighting to speak to who they &apos;re going to ."
"and you can <unk> your mind , you can go for any <unk> and everyone , and you can do it ."
"so , when they &apos;re faced with the government , they don &apos;t take care of their voices to use their voices ."
they &apos;re using their hands .
they use their hands to write apps that improve government &apos;s work .
and that apps give us your hands to improve our communities .
"that could be a fire fire <unk> up , put an <unk> with a <unk> <unk> ."
"we could have <unk> these fire <unk> all the times , and many people do this ."
"but these apps are like little digital <unk> that we are not only consumers , and not only government of government who are paying and paying taxes for ."
"we are more than us , we &apos;re citizens ."
"and we will not get better and better by <unk> , to improve the same ."
"so the question that i &apos;ve all of you here : if we &apos;re going to do this big , important things we have to do together , all of the stuff we &apos;ll are only a lot of true , or will we &apos;re going to be a whole ?"
thank you .
"usually , my role in telling the people about the new technologies that are going to be <unk> , and i thought , because i &apos;ve come up under my friends at the end i &apos;d actually tell you what i really often and really , and try to see ."
"i &apos;ll start by showing you just a single , boring slide for you ."
you might have a <unk> on the slide for a moment .
this is a slide i <unk> from my <unk> .
"i &apos;m not about the detail of this slide here , but it &apos;s actually to be around the kind of the <unk> process ."
"this is the following data that shows us how we are compared by terms of <unk> processors , with the performance of a <unk> performance ."
"the interesting here is that , the <unk> , like <unk> , we often <unk> in our field , is a form of a curve in a very <unk> ."
"in other words , every step here is one that &apos;s in the <unk> ."
and that &apos;s a kind of <unk> that we have to use this kind of <unk> of sequence curves in the field of technology .
something very <unk> happened in here .
this is essentially what i &apos;ll be talking about here .
"so , if you could <unk> the light again ."
another thing that is <unk> because i just &apos;m drawing one to the paper here .
now why do you draw <unk> <unk> in technology with curves ?
"and the reason is that if i &apos;d draw it on the normal curve , where do we say , this is a <unk> , and this is a timeline of the same event that i want to share with the technology which i want , and the <unk> ."
they see this stuff .
that &apos;s not a lot of us don &apos;t tell us .
"so if i want to <unk> a different technology , we would tell you that this would take on the <unk> , on a very <unk> very <unk> , in a flat line ."
"but as something happened here , then this changes the <unk> ."
"and if <unk> as much as the <unk> would , then we could <unk> <unk> into a <unk> and in 30 seconds , we would be in <unk> in <unk> ."
but it won &apos;t go quickly .
"that was never even before in the history of the growth of <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , which is going to increase <unk> every couple and <unk> exponentially ."
"so the question i &apos;d like to ask you now is , if you look at these <unk> curves , you don &apos;t go forever ."
"it &apos;s not possible that everything is going to be <unk> , as fast as it is ."
there are two ways there .
"they &apos;re either going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> , like something very different from the way that they &apos;re going to do this , right ?"
this is it in about something .
"well i &apos;m actually <unk> , so i think that &apos;s going to happen to be like something like here ."
"and that &apos;s what that means , which is , in the middle here , we are here right now right in an movement ."
"we &apos;re here on the line , in a transition from the past of the world , from one way around a new type of world ."
"so i want to ask the question , and i also think it too much of myself in a place , how is this new world <unk> ?"
"what is that new <unk> , the world is <unk> ."
"because that transition seems very , very <unk> , if you &apos;re in it right there ?"
"when i was a child , that was , in fact , that the future in 2000 and the people often spoke about what &apos;s going on in 2000 , in <unk> 2000 ."
"now , we have a conference here about where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still still in the year ."
"on earth , we won &apos;t ."
"so in other words , the future of every year has been <unk> for a year since i am ."
i think the reason for that is we realize everything is going to be in there .
the transition is happening . we can all feel that .
"and we know that it &apos;s not just doing a sense of <unk> to try to take 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything else &apos;s being <unk> is a very straightforward <unk> of which we don &apos;t make a sense right now ."
"so i want to talk to you what that might be , this transition in we &apos;re at the moment ."
"in order to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some else stuff which have to do nothing with technology or computers ."
"because i believe in order to really understand that , we have to move step back and see this at some point at the <unk> ."
and this is what i &apos;m looking at in the <unk> of life in the earth .
i think the big thing made meaning when you <unk> it within a number of <unk> .
"so we &apos;ll go back , and <unk> billion years from that , the earth was a great , <unk> <unk> with many chemicals that we &apos;re doing ."
"so if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , then that kind of has a pretty good picture on what the <unk> is ."
"and i also believe there is theories that start to start understanding how everything has begun , but i will tell you about a <unk> history of which is that at this time there is a small <unk> of <unk> <unk> of chemicals for chemicals ."
some of these oil and oil <unk> a particular combination of chemicals that they &apos;re <unk> with the <unk> of chemicals to grow and to grow .
"all of they were , they started to be <unk> ."
"these <unk> , those <unk> were the <unk> in the sense ."
"but these oil oil were <unk> not around , but all of the same , because each one is just a small , <unk> recipe for chemicals ."
"and every time it <unk> , the <unk> <unk> are spread as about to <unk> chemicals ."
"so , every <unk> was a little different ."
"in fact , the <unk> that had one of the growth of the growth of <unk> , the process of <unk> , and <unk> more and more chemicals , and <unk> and <unk> faster with chemicals ."
so this <unk> of <unk> to survive longer and it <unk> into <unk> .
"and so that &apos;s just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if you learned a <unk> trick , you can do that ."
"in some ways of the fact that we didn &apos;t have any sense is that the ability to <unk> this information , <unk> information ."
"they &apos;ve learned the recipe to the cell as a <unk> , and that &apos;s in a specific chemical shape that we call dna ."
"in other words , they found that <unk> , <unk> , found some way that allowed them to give it <unk> to this information that could be made <unk> and <unk> ."
the amazing thing is that this kind of information is <unk> about the time of <unk> billion years of <unk> that they were <unk> right now .
"in fact that recipe for you , that &apos;s why the genes from your same code , and the same <unk> <unk> ."
"and each creature , the same same <unk> used the same code as the same code ."
"we &apos;re <unk> to write only to write , to the code , for himself , to write in this code ."
and i &apos;ve got 100 percent <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> that i &apos;m starting to keep out in the airports .
"there &apos;s in it -- which i &apos;ve made , i have taken this code -- the code &apos;s made from normal letters that we &apos;re doing to <unk> -- and i have my dna in a piece of dna <unk> , and it &apos;s written 10 times <unk> ."
"so if somebody would like a hundred million of them out of my <unk> , i &apos;ve had enough for anybody in this room and even for everyone in the world to everybody &apos;s in the world here , and that it &apos;s the middle of it ."
"i really was going to have been an <unk> , then i would write it in the space and <unk> it into that room ."
so what is the next step ?
and the <unk> of all the dna was an interesting step .
and the most amazing cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
"but then another thing happened to do , very interesting , very interesting step where things were completely different from the world , and then these cells started to communicate , and that information came together , so that the communities created from cells ."
"so i don &apos;t know if you knew this before , but bacteria could actually make the dna ."
"that &apos;s why , for example , is the key for <unk> to antibiotics ."
"some bacteria have found how they can be <unk> from <unk> and have these information together with others in which we &apos;ve written to each other &apos;s bacteria , and now we have got lots of bacteria that will be <unk> on <unk> , because bacteria can communicate it ."
"now this communication allows to enable the reasons for community communities , which was in a sense of , in the same boat , they were the main way ."
"so they had to survive in them , or they were left under . it was , that , if you have been successful , all the individuals have been to keep off the community more <unk> and further from evolution ."
"and the <unk> is there in order of the communities that they have so close to that , so they would <unk> the recipe for the entire community into a <unk> <unk> of dna ."
and the next time that was happening about one more billion years .
"so in this time , we have <unk> communities , <unk> communities that have a different <unk> , which come together to have each organism ."
"so in fact , we have this sort of <unk> community ."
we have lots of cells that aren &apos;t <unk> for alone .
"your skin cells , no longer <unk> , <unk> cells , brain cells and so forth ."
"so the communities started making evolve , so that the level of evolution has happened , not a single one cell , but the whole cell <unk> that we call , by organism ."
so the next step has been in this communities here .
the <unk> <unk> started information about <unk> .
and they developed special structures that did nothing different than using information within the organism .
"and they &apos;re the <unk> structures , and these are the <unk> ."
so the neurons are the <unk> that <unk> built .
"they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for the <unk> , understanding and <unk> of information ."
"and this was the brain , and the nervous system for these communities ."
this gave you an <unk> advantage .
"because at this point , an individual -- learn from the time in the time of a organism , instead of that evolutionary species , for time , ."
"so one organism was able to learn to eat a certain <unk> of suffering because they made bad and couldn &apos;t get it sick , the last time he ate it ."
"now , in this life could have been done by one organism , before hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this is going to have this information that was learned from individuals that had been in the individuals that have been <unk> ."
so the nervous system has this <unk> <unk> with this particular <unk> because the evolution was able to do in a brain process .
it could take place in a <unk> of time .
what happened afterwards is that individual organisms found a way to communicate <unk> <unk> .
"so , as example , we know that <unk> version of this <unk> is human language ."
it &apos;s an amazing invention when it &apos;s really amazing .
"so , i have a very <unk> , <unk> and <unk> idea to my head ."
"i &apos;m here and we basically have <unk> sounds of me , <unk> to make hope that sort of , with a very similar idea in <unk> , that a certain <unk> , a very <unk> with my original idea ."
"so , we &apos;re taking this sort of complicated , you know , it <unk> into some sequence of dna , and it <unk> into something very complicated by the other one thing ."
so this is what allows us to do with a <unk> organism to work .
"and we actually have done , we have humanity ; we started to start <unk> ."
"we &apos;re all through the <unk> , which <unk> have <unk> , <unk> our methods to <unk> the data that we can <unk> , <unk> ."
the invention of language was a little step into the direction .
"<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> , and so on , are our mental <unk> , which have made us <unk> in our community to <unk> them ."
"and it connects together all that together into something that &apos;s much bigger , and , even faster , even more and more quickly , than we &apos;ve been to ."
"so now , evolution can happen in <unk> ."
you &apos;ve also saw <unk> little <unk> <unk> when he showed a little evolution in &quot; <unk> &quot; program right out directly in your eyes .
so we have <unk> the <unk> again .
"the first steps i &apos;ve told you , you know , <unk> a billion years per piece ."
"the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , are <unk> out a few hundred million years ."
"then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , <unk> are less than a million years ."
"and the next steps , like electronics , they seem very few decades to take a look ."
"the process <unk> itself , and it &apos;s <unk> , so i think the word is the word for this -- if something more <unk> ."
"the more it changes , the more it change ."
and i think this is what we &apos;re watching in the <unk> curve .
so we &apos;re seeing the process that &apos;s <unk> from itself .
"i live <unk> from building computers , and i know i use the <unk> to make the computer , not use computers , without the recently , on <unk> ."
what i do is the current <unk> in making objects of such a high complexity with which is that it &apos;s possible to be able to design those in the traditional sense ?
i know not what each individual <unk> does in the <unk> .
so it &apos;s billions of them .
"and what i do instead is we do , and what the rules of <unk> is to make a sense , we think of some <unk> of that in the brain and the machine makes it a little bit , our ability to <unk> and make it even faster ."
and it &apos;s partly in terms of ways that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
"it &apos;s a way that &apos;s especially interesting and that i &apos;ve used for the time in recent times , that evolution itself is ."
so we &apos;re <unk> the power <unk> in the machine which is going to happen at the <unk> .
to put a example into a <unk> of the way that we could create a program that <unk> out of the world .
"we &apos;re saying , &quot; computers , <unk> , <unk> million <unk> of the <unk> ."
"now , please , all of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and eventually , <unk> , which are my favorite , <unk> the next one . &quot;"
"so in other words , i do something that i want ."
"so we say , i want to <unk> that i &apos;m just a sort of an example of what i &apos;d use ."
so it &apos;s find programs that can do <unk> programs .
"of course , when they have a chance of <unk> <unk> , they think they &apos;re very small in <unk> with <unk> , which is , so that probably won &apos;t be the <unk> in the <unk> ."
but one of them may like to do with two <unk> <unk> in the right order .
"now let me say , &quot; well , now the guy &apos;s taking 10 percent of the <unk> that my <unk> come to the next ."
this is <unk> to the rest .
"now , we have <unk> all <unk> that have the best <unk> <unk> ."
"and this is the <unk> approach , <unk> to the <unk> ."
"take two jobs , and they provide children with the <unk> of their <unk> , and kids are <unk> the <unk> that the <unk> give them two programs ."
"and so that i have created a new generation of communities that have <unk> programs , which are closer to the <unk> that are more closely at the time ."
"<unk> , please <unk> the process . &quot;"
they put it again again .
so <unk> may have some mutations .
and attempt all this with another generation .
all of those generations only need very few <unk> .
"so , i have a evolution of millions of years of going on within a computer in less hour or <unk> a few times ."
"finally , i have programs that can make free <unk> ."
"and in fact , these programs are so much as <unk> as every program i could ever write by hand ."
"if i look at these programs , then then i can &apos;t tell you how they do it ."
i tried to understand it .
"and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re very strange programs ."
but they do the job .
"and i know , and i am sure they were doing the job , because they are going from a row of <unk> programs that do work ."
because they were <unk> their life if they were doing the job right .
"i &apos;d go to a map of the <unk> in a <unk> with <unk> , he <unk> a map to see he , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; oh , look at that ."
"there &apos;s this airplane <unk> of <unk> working together , which is <unk> your flight in a <unk> <unk> . does not <unk> you ?"
"well , we know that a <unk> is not <unk> when he &apos;s too complicated ."
so let &apos;s go out and <unk> to a process that can actually <unk> from the classic <unk> to the very different one .
he allows us to produce things with much greater complexity than it would allow computers to produce .
"and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities yet ."
so the technologies are <unk> us to <unk> .
"so we &apos;re using these programs to do much more <unk> at the computer so that we can , that we can be able to do these sorts of things faster again ."
so that &apos;s the <unk> .
"it gets faster and faster , and it &apos;s the reason why it appears so much as it seems <unk> ."
because all of these new technologies now are <unk> by <unk> .
we &apos;re <unk> .
we &apos;ve been to a point at the <unk> to have gone back to the time that <unk> evolved at the point .
"and so we &apos;ve got the <unk> , and we can &apos;t even do what the hell we are here at a way ."
we are in that <unk> .
but i really think after that .
i think it &apos;s very popular to us to say that we &apos;re the <unk> of evolution .
"and i think we &apos;re all here , in some sense of the <unk> of whatever &apos;s coming ."
"well , that &apos;s before , and i &apos;m reading this one now before i &apos;ll be <unk> ."
"i mean , i &apos;m going to start in <unk> here in <unk> , about two years ago ."
"i &apos;ve been out of the <unk> , <unk> in the desert <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
and we talked about it that nothing has changed since the time of the <unk> indian <unk> .
"if we had indian travels to travels and <unk> in the sky in a vehicle , <unk> <unk> ."
now we &apos;re making it with the airplanes .
"and in that time when it had a large indian <unk> <unk> <unk> , he took some <unk> , <unk> into the water and water ."
"now , we do it with <unk> and machines ."
we came to the <unk> that <unk> and magic was with machines by machines .
that was really <unk> sad .
i got something scared of technology .
it made my surprise that i could lose the capacity to enjoy the feedback without play with the camera and without my friends .
"and i found that technology should possibly be able to do magic , and not kill ."
"when i was a little bit girl , i gave my grandfather to be little , <unk> ."
"this piece was the <unk> thing for 50 years , the most interesting thing was <unk> to me ."
"she became an golden access to the world of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> to images within my notion ."
"i was so concerned when the <unk> was <unk> , our gloves and we got our cameras out of dreams ."
they took us to be inspired by the <unk> .
"and so , i went into the world of technology to think of how i could use magic instead of killing ."
and by 16 i got books to <unk> .
"as i saw the ipad , it was a device that i saw for <unk> <unk> <unk> to connect to the world ."
and it can see how we think .
it can tell you how to are .
"it &apos;s <unk> images and text together and animation , and animation , play ."
that <unk> needed more sense of .
but how do we do this ?
"and i &apos;m just going to give an ipad , an electronic ipad ."
this is : &quot; look &quot; <unk> your fingers for every light . &quot;
and that &apos;s what &apos;s like that one is : &quot; that little bit &apos;s what i write my name .
and i get a character in the book .
"and again , an letter drops for me -- and that ipad <unk> through <unk> -- that &apos;s right to me ."
so the kid in my mind really excited about that kind of possibilities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
"i don &apos;t mean a magician and <unk> and <unk> , but the <unk> of childhood the age of being that you had as children ."
"there &apos;s a glass of glass , i kept getting really exciting ."
you have to put the ipad here and the fireflies <unk> off .
and the <unk> of all the way through the <unk> book .
"so , another idea that fascinated me as a child is that one galaxy can put a whole galaxy in the only ."
"and so there is every book here , and every world will come up with a small <unk> i &apos;m <unk> here to the magic device in the device ."
and this opening card .
"<unk> had always been cards , but these maps were <unk> ."
"this map <unk> and it <unk> , and it <unk> <unk> into the rest of the book ."
it also <unk> to another <unk> of the book .
i go here .
"it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is <unk> , but also very <unk> ."
this is the <unk> .
"we &apos;ve all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people in india do you know their indian colleagues , who are <unk> in love ?"
"the poor , they had been <unk> thousands of years in <unk> , in an old <unk> book ."
"and we &apos;re going to get them back to a story , in contemporary history ."
"a story that has <unk> to new <unk> , like the <unk> ."
"to the subject is a huge problem of the last 10 years , kids sitting in their <unk> are on their computers without <unk> ."
"but now with <unk> technology , we can take our children into the natural world with our technology ."
"in an interaction physics of the book , you &apos;ll get out and you have to <unk> out , and you have to collect natural <unk> from the <unk> of the image of these <unk> objects ."
"and as a kid i had <unk> from <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ."
so the kids do not much more .
this is <unk> . it &apos;s going to go out to the chapter in chapter a photo of the <unk> and to <unk> .
in another chapter you need to be a piece of <unk> and to play in .
and so you can actually make digital collection of photographs that you can then ask online .
"a child in london shows the picture of an artist , and says , &quot; oh , i have seen a <unk> . &quot;"
"so a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a <unk> of a monkey today . &quot;"
it creates a kind of kind of social network around a digital set of photographs that we actually recorded .
there are a range of ways of making magic of the world and technology .
"we use the next book in which we use interaction with which we use video games and through <unk> <unk> <unk> , an animation of dna <unk> that appear to appear on a surface on the ground ."
and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> at a place .
"you &apos;ve got to do the sounds of <unk> , and you read it out , <unk> your <unk> ."
"we all are moving towards a world , in which the forces of the technology of the technology , so in which <unk> , and technology can <unk> itself ."
we use the energy of the sun .
"we <unk> our children to step into the natural world and to the <unk> , fun of our love , through the simple medium of history ."
thank you .
that really is an <unk> <unk> for me .
"i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ."
i spend most of the time with the social <unk> the <unk> <unk> and in places that there is a lot more <unk> .
"now here &apos;s ted to be to see and listening , and seeing what the <unk> is , i &apos;ve been doing very much force ."
"and in that moment here , i was clear to my <unk> : ted has an identity ."
"so , you can tell things that have all over the world ."
"sometimes when something about ted comes , it gets a meaning and force that would never have otherwise ."
"i mean , that &apos;s because i believe that identity is very important ."
we &apos;ve seen a fantastic <unk> .
"i think we &apos;ve learned that the words have a meaning to the same , but those are the words of a <unk> particularly <unk> ."
"as a doctor , you can do good as the doctor doctor , but you can do more ."
and so that &apos;s why i want to talk about identity .
i didn &apos;t learn it in my work as a lawyer and a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
"i got big in a family , a traditional home , of a japanese household , who was <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> was my grandmother ."
"it was a <unk> , powerful woman , it has had a impact ."
she had the last word in every <unk> one .
she was also <unk> of many <unk> in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
and their parents were <unk> in the <unk> in virginia as a <unk> .
she was born to birth and <unk> the experience of slavery very well .
"my grandmother was strong , but she was a <unk> ."
"if i did a kid to meet her as a little boy , she got into me and came to me with me and i <unk> ."
it <unk> me to realize that i could hardly breath . then let me go out .
"one or two hours later , if i was in her , she came up to me and said , &quot; <unk> , do you get my favorite ? &quot;"
"and when i said , &quot; oh , no , she &apos;ll get me down . she said &quot; yes , she would have <unk> me ."
it was something that made you always wanted to be close to her .
"the one thing is , you had 10 children ."
my mother was my youngest kids .
"sometimes when i was doing the time with her , it was very difficult to get your attention ."
my cousins were all over there .
"i remember , i have to have eight or nine , that i went out to one morning and went into living room . and all of my cousins were <unk> around ."
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> and <unk> me .
i thought it &apos;d be an game .
"i saw it and <unk> them , but she did see it really seriously ."
"and that came about this <unk> and 20 minutes . and then she went to me and <unk> them . she took me in the hand , and she said , &quot; come , <unk> , and i will talk , you . &quot;"
"i remember , as though it was yesterday ."
i never forget .
"she took me out to me after , and she said <unk> , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you have to have the promise that you don &apos;t know . &quot;"
"i said , &quot; <unk> , grandmother , grandmother . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i &apos;m like , &quot; yes . &quot;"
"she sat me up and she looked at myself . she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;m watching you . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re an special . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; well , i think you could do anything you want to do . &quot;"
i &apos;ll never forget that .
"they said , &quot; you have to promise me about three things , you need . &quot;"
"so i said , &quot; okay , grandmother . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; first of all , you know , you &apos;re going to love your mama , always . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; you know , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you &apos;ve got to pay attention to you that you &apos;ll do it all you . &quot;"
"and i <unk> my mother , so i said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to do it . &quot;"
"so she said , &quot; well when she was next to me , you will always do the right thing , &quot; but also if there &apos;s a <unk> of doing the right . &quot;"
"i thought to the point , and i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise . &quot;"
"after all , she said , &quot; well , the last one you have to have to promise is you &apos;re never going to be <unk> . &quot;"
"now i was nine years old and so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i hope . &quot;"
"i grew up on the land , rural , south , and i got a dog that &apos;s older to six times and a year a half sister ."
"as i was about 14 or 15 to an age of a day , i got my brother at home and made this <unk> beer with him and went to me and went to the forest ."
we were just <unk> around it as we do .
"then he took a <unk> beer , and had a <unk> <unk> , and she took one of mine , and then they gave me a sign to me ."
"i said , &quot; no , no , no . ok . do you do . don &apos;t just . me don &apos;t want to beer . &quot;"
"my brother say , &quot; well , do that , now we do what you do , you &apos;re not doing anything we &apos;re going on ."
i had had what her sister had . go out a <unk> . &quot;
"i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . you just do . do you . &quot;"
my brother <unk> to me .
"he said , &quot; what &apos;s <unk> to you ? well , what . &quot;"
"then he looked down into the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you know , do you don &apos;t worry about <unk> because the <unk> was going to have to be with the grandmother ? &quot;"
"i said , &quot; what <unk> you do ? &quot;"
"he said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> , she tells them what to be . &quot;"
i was <unk> on the ground .
i &apos;ll <unk> you a bit more <unk> .
i should not do that .
and that may be <unk> for public education .
i &apos;m a 52 years old and i <unk> that i have never <unk> a drop of <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s symmetrical . i say that &apos;s identity because identity does it mean .
if we get the right kind of identity that we can give people people tell us things that don &apos;t think they don &apos;t work at all .
"we could get them to do things , which they thought they could not ."
"of course , my grandmother would say all her grandmother and say something special ."
my grandfather was in jail during the prison <unk> .
"my uncle died of <unk> diseases , <unk> ."
and she said that that &apos;s the issues we &apos;d like to do .
i tried to tell something about our <unk> .
this country is a different than 40 years ago .
"in &apos; back , <unk> were people in <unk> <unk> , and in jail ."
"now , it is <unk> million ."
and the united states today have the most <unk> in the world .
seven million people <unk> are <unk> or <unk> with <unk> .
"in a way that i think <unk> have , the way we have <unk> a lot of the world ."
"in social and black and black parts of the population of <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the population , because of these changes ."
"one of three <unk> black black <unk> is in <unk> , in jail , in prison , and on <unk> of <unk> with a <unk> ."
"the <unk> communities throughout western communities -- from los angeles across <unk> -- 50 percent to washington -- is 50 percent of every black men in <unk> , in a jail , in <unk> , <unk> , on <unk> <unk> or with <unk> <unk> ."
"our system is not going to be shaped by the questions that have been <unk> to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also being <unk> by poverty ."
"we have a <unk> of <unk> in this land that makes you better if you &apos;re rich and rich , as poor ."
"wealth , not <unk> . it <unk> the outcome ."
"still , we seem to be happy ."
it &apos;s a policy policy of fear and anger have convinced ourselves to believe that those problems are not our problems .
we have lost touch .
i find interesting .
there are a few <unk> <unk> .
"my favorite <unk> of <unk> <unk> for the left right , <unk> to fight if you &apos;re <unk> ."
"and here , in <unk> , 19 percent of the <unk> population , they lost <unk> to their rights in the <unk> ."
we &apos;re <unk> that in 10 years the <unk> is <unk> as high as the <unk> is <unk> .
"the silence , <unk> , right ."
i represent children .
i &apos;ve got a lot of young mine in a very young age .
"the united states , the single country , in the world , is the only country in the world , is to <unk> children in <unk> <unk> ."
"in our own country , we have children who have <unk> <unk> without <unk> ."
we &apos;ve already started to run a lot of work .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in <unk> .
the question of death is an interesting question .
we believe because we &apos;re learning that it &apos;s so taught that the true question is : how did a human being <unk> for him ?
"this is a very exciting question , very ."
"and also , you can think very different about it , on how to think our identity is ."
"the other perspective is not , someone <unk> to a crime , but does it make it be made , is we <unk> it ?"
and i find the <unk> .
the death of america is defined by <unk> .
"on nine people we <unk> , come from a <unk> for innocent <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> ."
a amazing <unk> . one of nine thousand .
i find that <unk> .
"we would never leave anybody who could fly someone , if it &apos;s to nine planes , that would be out of a <unk> ."
"but somehow , we can get involved of that problem in this problem ."
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not the <unk> of our <unk> .
this isn &apos;t our <unk> .
and i am talking a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question that we have is right to kill .
"and it &apos;s <unk> because i &apos;m telling my student <unk> story , and i &apos;ll talk about slavery ."
"i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time against the <unk> , until the beginning of the world &apos;s <unk> ."
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
"but for the <unk> of this land , it was a time of the <unk> ."
in many areas that people had to be afraid of fear .
or before bombs .
it was <unk> fear that made her life .
"now , these older people come back to me , they say , &quot; oh , <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re going to be talking about it , they say to me to stop saying that we need the first time for september of our nation as long age ."
"and they say , no -- you say humans , that we &apos;re growing for it . &quot;"
"and after the terrorism of course , the <unk> and decades of the <unk> <unk> and ends up ."
"and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems ."
we don &apos;t want to talk about our story .
and therefore we don &apos;t really understand what the importance of this in the historical context have .
we are constantly <unk> .
we always create new <unk> and conflicts .
"it &apos;s hard to speak about race , and i believe that &apos;s not necessarily that we are <unk> to the truth , to come to the <unk> and the <unk> ."
"and in south africa , people have understood that <unk> is not over <unk> without <unk> the willingness to truth and <unk> ."
"even after the <unk> in rwanda in the <unk> , they were doing the willingness , but not in this country ."
"i have some <unk> in germany , and i <unk> the death ."
"so , it was <unk> because , of one scientists , when a scientist was standing up on the front of a presentation and said , &quot; they know that &apos;s truly <unk> , you &apos;re talking about . &quot;"
"he said , in germany , they have been not a death ."
"and of course , they can never have more in germany . &quot;"
"there was still silence . then the woman said , &quot; well , with our story , it &apos;s possible that we have ever killed back for the <unk> of people ."
this is something that we would <unk> <unk> and <unk> people &apos;s minds .
i thought about that .
"and how it <unk> would have <unk> living in a world where the black population had <unk> , especially when many jews are <unk> ."
it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
"and yet here , in this country , where the u.s. war <unk> is , we <unk> -- here &apos;s the risk for <unk> to death , <unk> , when the death is higher , when the black is white and when black . when it is <unk> <unk> ."
and yet there is these mental mental <unk> .
i believe that our identity is threatened .
"when we don &apos;t worry about those tough subjects , the positive and wonderful things have already affected ."
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love <unk> .
"but finally , those <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ."
"my matter to me , i &apos;m going to find both both ."
"because , we &apos;re ultimately telling that you that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment , to get into the complex world ."
so this <unk> the time to me think about and talk about poor people that never will be at ted .
"but thinking in a way , in a way that &apos;s embedded in our own lives ."
"we all have to think of things , in the end , and we can not see things that we &apos;re seeing ."
we do that . it &apos;s so much of what we &apos;re rational with .
"innovation , creativity , and development are not just coming out of our heads ."
"they come from ideas , that are driven through the belief inside of our hearts ."
"it is this <unk> that i believe that it <unk> us , not just open to be all about <unk> for all of the <unk> and <unk> , but also the dark and the dark ."
"<unk> <unk> , the big <unk> of politicians , <unk> once said ."
"&quot; when we <unk> in eastern europe to the <unk> , we wanted to get it all the other way , but what we needed most , hope was an mental <unk> , <unk> of sometimes <unk> on <unk> places , and be <unk> . &quot;"
the <unk> <unk> is to the essence of what i think also must be involved with this as an <unk> .
"there are no <unk> for technology and design that allow it to be , <unk> and to be human , as long as we can &apos;t have eyes and <unk> for poverty , <unk> ."
"i want to <unk> you , and this kind of identity needs a lot of us more than if we don &apos;t think about it anymore . &quot;"
it will become profoundly <unk> .
"as a <unk> of a young doctor , i <unk> the large privilege to meet pink <unk> ."
"and then <unk> came back to <unk> where , and they <unk> two of their old friends , <unk> , these older people , <unk> , who <unk> the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , black woman , who <unk> , <unk> husband , <unk> , the male <unk> , husband <unk> ."
"so these women were meeting , and they just were <unk> ."
"and then we started <unk> and saying , &quot; <unk> woman comes out into the city , we want to go to a school <unk> ."
do they want to listen and listen to <unk> ? &quot;
"and i said , &quot; well , it &apos;s very much like . &quot;"
"he said , &quot; well , what will you do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;"
"i said , &quot; i &apos;ll listen . &quot;"
and i was walking over and i just <unk> about .
"it was so inspiring , and it was <unk> ."
"i was sitting there one day and i was listening to these women , and after some hours , a woman turned to me , and he said , &quot; well , you know , what the initiative is true for the initiative , i was in the initiative ."
what do you try to do ? &quot;
i started by the <unk> talk .
"i said , &quot; well , you &apos;re trying to do <unk> <unk> ."
people want to help people to help them <unk> .
we want to <unk> and discrimination on the <unk> .
we want to get rid of the <unk> without <unk> without children .
we want something about the death penalty society .
we want to cut down the number of <unk> .
we want to stop <unk> . &quot;
"i gave my <unk> talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;"
she said that this is what they &apos;re going to do extremely high .
"so , <unk> &apos;s woman <unk> to me and <unk> , <unk> a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you have to be very , very , very <unk> ."
"and that &apos;s why , i think the <unk> ought to be the <unk> ."
"we need to make ways for ways to ask this challenges : that problems , of that ."
"because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity ."
so i &apos;ve learned a very simple thing in my work .
i learned a few simple things .
"that we &apos;re all more , as the worst one we &apos;ve ever made ."
i think that &apos;s true for each people on the planet .
"when somebody <unk> , it &apos;s not just the liars ."
"if somebody gets something he doesn &apos;t hear him , not just a <unk> ."
and even who kill somebody is not just a <unk> .
and because that is something that would be a fundamental human to respect the law .
"i also believe that in many parts of this country , in many parts of the world , with safety parts of the earth , are not <unk> of poverty ."
i don &apos;t think that .
"i believe in a number of places , the opposite of poverty is justice ."
"and eventually i think that despite a way that you &apos;re so dramatically , as a very inspiring and inspiring and so <unk> , at the end of our technology , not at the end of the things that we have , not , in our mind and our mind ."
"finally , a society will not be used to measure their rich and <unk> , but <unk> how to <unk> them with the poor , the food , the <unk> , the <unk> ."
"because in that context , we are starting to understand what &apos;s amazing things that make you ."
"sometimes , i &apos;m losing the end of the story . a story to the end ."
and sometimes i go to very much .
i &apos;m going to get tired of how we all do .
"sometimes these ideas think we think are going to think about important in the very , very important way ."
i represent these kids that were very <unk> <unk> .
"i go to the <unk> and i &apos;ll be an <unk> to be at the <unk> , who may be 13 or 14 years old to be the one in court trial ."
"then , i wonder : how did that happen ?"
how can an judges turn into something that he &apos;s <unk> ?
"the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child ."
"i stayed in one night and i had a long time , and i thought , if my mind could transform the judge into something else -- then he must have <unk> ."
"<unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
you should have something that would want to be .
"and because it was too late , i couldn &apos;t even think i was starting to work on a <unk> ."
"i had a happy <unk> , poor black young as <unk> ."
"and i started <unk> with this <unk> . <unk> : &quot; <unk> , my arms , my rich <unk> <unk> like a white <unk> , white <unk> ."
"my <unk> , i explained that <unk> the police and the police and <unk> might be a <unk> ."
there was a <unk> line of the line over the country that &apos;s nothing more <unk> that there &apos;s only been <unk> .
"i didn &apos;t know the next morning and i had any more about it , i &apos;d written this weird little <unk> or i was actually written him ."
"and then , i had not only written him in the dish , i used to <unk> to the court ."
so a few months and i just had to forget everything about it .
"but finally , i decided to have my god , i &apos;m going to go to the court , and i must give you the crazy case ."
"i got into a car , and was very overwhelmed by the car ."
so i started to the court .
"and i thought , it &apos;s getting so hard to do so painful ."
"i ended up up in my car , and then i went to the <unk> ."
when i was the staircase in the court there was a <unk> person <unk> to the <unk> in the court .
"when he saw me he got <unk> to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;"
"so i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re lawyer ? i said , &quot; i said , &quot;"
he came to me and <unk> <unk> me .
then he brought me to <unk> .
"he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;"
"and i have to say , there were a force ."
"it &apos;s <unk> a slightly <unk> towards me , identity , the ability to make a <unk> to one community , a perspective of hope ."
"well , i <unk> the <unk> ."
once the judges saw me .
"he said , &quot; <unk> , do you ask these crazy <unk> ? &quot;"
"i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss ."
"and more people came in , because they were angry , because they were angry ?"
i had written these crazy things .
<unk> came into and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
"in the <unk> , the <unk> was full of people who were angry who have talked about <unk> languages , about poverty , about inequality ."
i looked at the <unk> and i went to the <unk> .
"so he looked back through the window , and we could hear this thing coming up again and hear it the window ."
and he went and <unk> down there .
and the third person came to this old black man with the <unk> <unk> into the hall <unk> and put it straight behind me almost on the <unk> .
"10 minutes later , the judge is a <unk> ."
"and as it was an <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which was in the <unk> of the <unk> ."
that <unk> <unk> across to the older black black .
"he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do at <unk> ? &quot;"
"the older black man stood up . he saw the <unk> , he looked at me , and he said , he said , &quot; i am <unk> to tell this man lose it to not <unk> her face ."
i have come to this ted because i believe that a lot of you have understood that the moral <unk> of the universe far way beyond the universe is <unk> .
that we don &apos;t really know as people to be completely <unk> unless we care about rights and human rights .
that our survival is <unk> to the survival of the <unk> .
"that we need our visions of technology and design to connect to creativity and creativity with compassion , pity , justice and justice ."
"and , especially i want to see you from you who &apos;s looking at the same , just , just telling you -- don &apos;t tell your goal . not in your eyes ."
"you know this audience in this audience , this community of the obvious wish , and you have to learn to support them and do something ."
and what can we do more ?
"<unk> <unk> : well , everywhere , there &apos;s opportunities ."
"when you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> experiment in this spring , actually , to a effort to do something from <unk> , otherwise <unk> in politics ."
"here , california , for example , will be one dollar billion dollars for the death of death for a million dollars ."
"and yet , <unk> percent of the <unk> don &apos;t end with a <unk> ."
<unk> percent of <unk> are not going to court .
there &apos;s a chance that we have to do something .
and this <unk> will suggest that the money will be <unk> and <unk> .
i think everywhere there &apos;s opportunity .
as the past three decades the <unk> is <unk> down into america .
this one often gets brought into a <unk> <unk> .
what would you say to somebody &apos;s <unk> ?
"now , in fact , the number of violent silence didn &apos;t change really much ."
most of the <unk> <unk> in this country didn &apos;t actually find a <unk> of <unk> .
this was the most amazing thing against drugs .
"so , the most important people get to the <unk> ."
so we &apos;ve made <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
"now , we have a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who bring people down behind their food system , for a professional <unk> , for the <unk> of <unk> good , that instead it &apos;s being used to <unk> the <unk> ."
"and i think we need to do more in order to help people who have grown victims of crime , not less ."
and i think our <unk> will not help .
i think this is what we need to change .
"<unk> , so they have <unk> actually the <unk> of the <unk> ."
they &apos;re an inspiring character .
"thank you for ted , you were . thank you ."
and this is a <unk> of bin laden &apos;s <unk> with <unk> .
two : <unk> of <unk> <unk> . after three of the police were <unk> .
four : <unk> <unk> <unk> . five <unk> <unk> .
"six : <unk> <unk> . <unk> , 7 dead ."
eight of <unk> : <unk> . 9 : <unk> .
different . <unk> . <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> . foreign . <unk> . egypt .
crisis . death . disaster .
"oh , my god ."
"so , that &apos;s just some of the most <unk> i have collecting over the last six months -- but it could have been also the last six days and the last six years ."
"the fact is , the media prefer to show us <unk> of subjects because our minds are <unk> to their own topics ."
and they have a very good reason for it .
"every second day , our senses start <unk> the much more information than our <unk> can ever process ."
"and because we &apos;re more importantly than our survival , the first stop in all of our information , the most part of our <unk> , the <unk> of our own <unk> ."
"so the <unk> is our <unk> , our <unk> ."
this <unk> and <unk> the whole information that <unk> the information for <unk> of danger in our surroundings .
"so if we look down the news , we prefer keeping it at the negative news ."
"so the old <unk> is when it <unk> , the demand <unk> is true ."
"now , with all our digital <unk> that <unk> us seven days of the week , 24 hours a day , <unk> <unk> this <unk> , it &apos;s not a wonder that we &apos;re <unk> ."
and it is not a miracle that anyone thinks it &apos;s always worse in the world .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
we may have the huge progress in which we used through many of forces over a series of forces that are so strong that it &apos;ll be possible for us in the next three decades of the internet in a form of <unk> .
"now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- <unk> , <unk> , water and energy energy -- we already have that already ."
"and as humans we are far better at doing problems in a long time , but eventually they end up trying to overcome it ."
so we can look at what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century that we can do the development of the world .
"in the past 100 years , the average life expectancy has increased , which <unk> inflation has increased <unk> the population ."
child mortality has <unk> by the <unk> .
"and the <unk> that the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> itself ."
steve <unk> showed us that at the moment we live in a very <unk> period of life .
"and charles <unk> has the <unk> <unk> in the past <unk> years , over 25 percent to 80 percent ."
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations .
"in fact , we are defined poverty ."
"remember that a great deal of americans who live under the energy system , access water , water , <unk> , <unk> , television and cars and cars ."
"and the richest in the last century , the <unk> of the world , that the <unk> of the earth has never been <unk> with such <unk> ."
so that &apos;s what many of the techniques of things and these <unk> are <unk> .
"so my good friend ray <unk> showed us that every <unk> that <unk> becomes <unk> is taken to be able to grow up at the level of moore &apos;s language , and the <unk> doubled every 12 to 24 months ."
"that &apos;s how it costs about a million of them in your &apos; <unk> , much less , and <unk> <unk> faster than a <unk> back from the &apos; 70s ."
so look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
look at two things in the curve .
"one , how does it go -- in bad ways in worse than peace , war , recession or depression , depression and <unk> , and <unk> ."
"this is the result of <unk> computer , building computers ."
they have been <unk> of not the big problems .
"the way it &apos;s got , despite her <unk> , on the left , is up up ."
and that &apos;s what is happening is the <unk> themselves .
"and that curve , at the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available in the whole ."
"the <unk> &quot; what my friends with <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; , sensors , sensors and networks , robots that allow to allow personal production to <unk> biology to this planet , <unk> biology and <unk> , industrial <unk> ."
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> watson in a risk of risk ?
this was <unk> <unk> .
i did the <unk> <unk> and i &apos;ve been looking for the best headlines that i could find .
i love that one : &quot; watson &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
"<unk> , &quot; no simple play . &quot;"
it &apos;s about to understand the <unk> of the language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence of <unk> gives every single <unk> .
"four years ago , ray <unk> <unk> , i am at ted a new university which called <unk> university ."
"we bring all of these technologies , to <unk> , to the focus , how they get used to <unk> all the big challenges of mankind ."
"and every year , we ask the students , companies , companies and goods , we create in a decade to a decade , can be able to <unk> in <unk> people ."
think about how that a team of students now can affect the lives of billions of people .
"30 years ago , it &apos;d been ridiculous ."
"today , we have to <unk> <unk> of businesses who can do it ."
"when i think to create the art <unk> , i don &apos;t mean a life with luxury for each on this planet ; it goes me about creating a life full of possibilities ."
it &apos;s about creating from <unk> <unk> <unk> .
"because <unk> is a <unk> , and technology is a more powerful strength ."
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the 18th century in the 18th century .
he is the guy on the left .
he got a the king of <unk> to dinner .
"<unk> soldiers had come in , <unk> <unk> , <unk> ."
but the king of <unk> did get a <unk> .
"no time the <unk> was at the <unk> metal on the planet , <unk> and of them ."
"this is why the muscle has been made out of it , in fact ?"
but even <unk> <unk> percent of the <unk> does not come from metal in a field of metal .
it &apos;s being connected through oxygen and energy .
"but then , the technology of that we developed and it made so cheap , that we &apos;re using it with our <unk> systems ."
and then let us put this analogy in the future .
we &apos;re thinking of <unk> in today .
"ladies and gentlemen , we spend lives on a planet that <unk> with more energy <unk> than we &apos;ve had every year ."
16 energy <unk> <unk> all the <unk> of the earth &apos;s earth .
"it &apos;s not an <unk> problem , it &apos;s not about it ."
and there &apos;s good news .
"in this year , we &apos;ve done it the first <unk> , to reduce the cost of india in india , to 50 percent of the <unk> in india -- the age of 17 rupees ."
<unk> cost for 50 percent of the last year by 50 percent .
"now , last month <unk> the study that shows you , by the way , to the end of this decade in the u.s. region of the <unk> , <unk> six cents a <unk> per <unk> <unk> in national average ."
"and if we have <unk> , then we &apos;re going to have <unk> water into that <unk> ."
now let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
"do you remember when carl <unk> <unk> the <unk> as the <unk> of <unk> , it was back to earth &apos;s face ?"
he took a picture on it . how did it happen ?
&quot; a <unk> <unk> . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered 70 percent with the water .
"yeah , it &apos;s <unk> percent , two percent of it are <unk> , and we are <unk> percent about the power of the planet , but there is also hope ."
"and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years . now , but now ."
"they &apos;re new <unk> on the path , <unk> ."
"and from a conversation with dean <unk> , one of the most <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me the <unk> -- his <unk> <unk> , the &quot; which is called the <unk> , &quot; and many you may have about it ."
"it can produce a thousand <unk> <unk> of <unk> per day -- produce water , <unk> water , <unk> water , <unk> <unk> -- and all of it for less than two cents a <unk> of <unk> ."
now the <unk> of coca-cola has just <unk> a major place of <unk> with a hundred years of <unk> in developing world .
"and when it &apos;s all right , i am <unk> , and then it &apos;s going to be very <unk> , and coca-cola will be used in the whole <unk> world all over the planet all the right ."
this is <unk> innovation that &apos;s today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in an <unk> <unk> .
"you &apos;re all going , we are going to reach 70 percent , the 70 percent of <unk> in developing countries from the end of the <unk> ."
just consider that a mobile phone in the center of kenya has got better than president <unk> years ago .
"and when you look at your mobile smartphone at google , you know have a better access to knowledge and information as a president <unk> ."
"they &apos;re in a world which has information , and it &apos;s using information <unk> , as nobody ever have to have <unk> ."
"and it &apos;s going to work better , the things that you spend on , i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- and <unk> and picture , libraries full of books and music , and the medical website are literally <unk> and just cheaper on your cell phones ."
"and the best part of this might be , what we would expect in the realm of health ."
"i had just been the joy of <unk> that was called <unk> <unk> x <unk> prize , 10 million <unk> ."
"we &apos;re asking teams out around the world , all of these technologies , to together in a way to connect with the device that you &apos;re going to talk to <unk> is there with <unk> and then you cannot test your <unk> , or test ."
"and to winning that &apos;s got to do this , a device needs a better diagnosis than a team of physicians ."
"imagine this device . right in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , and 25 percent of the <unk> , and that is <unk> percent of the employees &apos;s team ."
"when this device gives an <unk> or <unk> genome that is not known , it does not <unk> and avoid <unk> a <unk> before it was going to take a <unk> ."
but we are now to the largest force that will lead us to a world of <unk> .
it &apos;s called &quot; a <unk> billion . &quot;
the white lines stand for people .
you just have the <unk> <unk> .
"and the way , the largest <unk> of <unk> , against the population , is a better education , and <unk> food throughout the world ."
we had now connected to two billion people in the world .
we &apos;re going to <unk> up from two <unk> to five and two billion <unk> .
"three billion <unk> of whom we &apos;ve ever heard of , the global communication will be <unk> ."
what do these people need ?
what are you getting into ? what will you <unk> ?
"and instead of <unk> <unk> of the largest economic economic growth , i see one of the great <unk> of history ."
these people represent several <unk> dollars that will be going to move around in the economy .
"and they become healthier by using food , and they &apos;re trained to be trained by <unk> , and by that they are the chance of using 3d <unk> and the <unk> 3d and a lot more and more productive than before they ever have before ."
"so , what can do three and a wide growing , healthy , productive <unk> members of <unk> us ?"
"like , it &apos;d be with a <unk> set of new voices that has never been done before ."
"how would it be to be the <unk> , where they are they , to be a voice to make sense of it and to change , for the even , in <unk> ?"
"and so , what are those three billion people <unk> ?"
what about <unk> that we don &apos;t even think of ?
"one of the things i have learned about x <unk> is that little teams that are brought in <unk> and focused on <unk> and focus , some things , things that the large companies can create in the past ."
and i want to finish with a story i really <unk> .
"there is a program , which may be familiar with ."
"it &apos;s an play , which is called a <unk> game ."
this was built at university of washington in seattle .
"and it &apos;s a game , in which people can take a sequence of amino dioxide to study the protein , how the protein is going to evolve ."
"and on its behavior , we can <unk> and function ."
and this is really important in the <unk> <unk> .
and the first thing was that <unk> for <unk> .
and it was played by <unk> and so played .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who &apos;ve been playing online .
"and it turns out that , today , the human <unk> actually <unk> the information <unk> as the best <unk> ."
"and as the people came and looked at the best <unk> in the world , this was not a <unk> -- it didn &apos;t be a <unk> from england , an manchester , an <unk> woman as an <unk> in a <unk> and the best part of a <unk> &apos;s <unk> ."
"and ladies and gentlemen , what &apos;s why i &apos;ve got enormous confidence in our future is that today &apos;s going to make more of the amount of individuals in our planet today , to provide the big challenges of our planet ."
we have access to tools with <unk> technology .
we have passion of a <unk> .
we have <unk> capital of the military .
"and we have three billion new heads that we can work online to <unk> the new challenges , to do it , and to do that ."
and we &apos;re going to expect a couple of extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do a <unk> piece of culture in a <unk> <unk> .
and i think this starts with a <unk> that i &apos;m .
"and maybe i &apos;ve been in the business for a long time , that when i can give me an event to give me a piece of wrong <unk> to allow this to make it ."
"but before i go to the real theme of my baseball , let &apos;s start with a little video ."
"you know , why isn &apos;t ?"
"we &apos;re near the <unk> , moving to the <unk> ."
"we all love baseball , right ?"
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; seems soon and is about statistics and taking care of this <unk> of <unk> .
and i will hope on a stage that i hope is that most of you have heard before .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we talk about a 300 when an <unk> <unk> 300 times .
that means that the player &apos;s safely one of 10 <unk> is <unk> .
"that is called the ball at <unk> , and he comes up to , and he is not <unk> , and who tried to throw the ball <unk> , it didn &apos;t have to go back in time and the <unk> in safety ."
three out of <unk> .
"you know , how do you call a <unk> in major <unk> ?"
"okay , well well , maybe a <unk> ."
do you know how to call an <unk> ?
this is somebody who &apos;s the most <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> -- like ted <unk> <unk> -- the last major discovered by the players who met <unk> <unk> on a <unk> on 400 times .
"let &apos;s take back to our world of medicine , <unk> to me in the way , i feel some <unk> and may have a bit less likely for the <unk> to talk about it ."
so suppose you have a <unk> and you &apos;re going to get a <unk> <unk> whose <unk> in 400 ways .
it &apos;s kind of stuff that doesn &apos;t it .
"suppose they have live in a certain region , and they have a loved one person with <unk> <unk> and their <unk> <unk> to one <unk> that is in the <unk> of 200 in terms of 200 ."
"but , but you know what ?"
it &apos;s much better than this year . it &apos;s on <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and she <unk> an <unk> .
it &apos;s not how that doesn &apos;t happen .
but i &apos;ll ask you a question .
"what do you think they think the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> for a <unk> , a <unk> , should be a <unk> ?"
"1,000 . very well ."
"the truth is that nobody in the whole medicine know what a good surgeon should be , or the doctor ."
"what we do , though , is we &apos;ve done every of them , literally , send me to the world with a <unk> ."
"never make a mistake , nobody else does it , but to see the details of what this <unk> will be like ."
and that is the message that i took in the <unk> .
i was an <unk> student in science .
"the high school time , a <unk> said brian <unk> was about a <unk> ."
and that &apos;s how it was .
"and i learned in my little <unk> of nurses , <unk> on the <unk> of general <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ."
i learned it all in the time .
"so i learned in my <unk> , and i learned the <unk> , every touch , every <unk> that would be <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ."
i actually knew <unk> about the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the time i collected more and more .
"and i &apos;ve been good , i &apos;ve been running through <unk> ."
"and i left with the kind of impression that , when i knew everything , and it knew anything , or at least so much as possible for <unk> in the other ways that i could <unk> for <unk> ."
"and it was <unk> for a while , <unk> , until i met wife ."
"i was putting in <unk> <unk> here at a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> into the <unk> of the <unk> ."
"so at that point , i was the <unk> cross layer on the local service ."
and it was my favorite time when the <unk> was looking for <unk> &apos;s advice to study this .
and i want to give you a bit of <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> <unk> and she was in <unk> <unk> .
"and then , when i gave her <unk> , they made sounds sounds like <unk> ."
"and when i could touch their breast with the <unk> <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound of two pages that said she was under a <unk> ."
"this is a state in which heart <unk> , instead of making all blood , it <unk> a part of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , so that was <unk> , and the space came from there ."
and that wasn &apos;t a very difficult <unk> .
i asked them and i made me care about the treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take her <unk> from heart .
"i gave her medicine we call <unk> , water , so she &apos;d <unk> this liquid ."
"and over one period of two or another , it started me to feel better ."
and i was really so good .
and i did my first errors ; that was what i &apos;d sent them home .
actually i did two experiments .
i sent them home with my <unk> .
"i didn &apos;t take the <unk> , and i did what a call &quot; what an <unk> call , &quot; my <unk> , that he had a chance to do a <unk> &apos;s had a whole picture . &quot;"
and he knew that he would have had been able to get extra information to her .
and perhaps i did it with a very <unk> thing .
maybe i couldn &apos;t be the doctor &apos;s doctor .
"maybe i wanted to be so successful , and i could have a responsibility for that , so that i would be so <unk> and so i could <unk> to my patient with my patient &apos;s ability to make a <unk> ."
my second mistake was worse .
"so this is what i sent home from this and i <unk> , i was making a quiet for me trying to say , &quot; <unk> , no good idea , &quot; no good thing . &quot;"
"in fact , i started to <unk> so much that i said the nurse , who took care of the wife , &quot; think she &apos;s right now when she goes home ? &quot;"
"and the nurse <unk> over and she said in <unk> kind , &quot; sure , i think it &apos;ll go well . &quot;"
i remember that as it did yesterday .
"and so i <unk> the <unk> , and i called an <unk> and <unk> came back , and they brought home ."
and so i went back into the work .
"the rest of my day , i &apos;d had this <unk> sense of sense in my own room ."
but i kept working on .
"and at the end of the day , i would end up <unk> this stuff , in a hospital , and then go to <unk> to the car , when i got to do something that i hadn &apos;t done ."
i went home through my way to house .
"and there was a different nurse , not watching sister the girl in <unk> but a different , i &apos;ll give you a little <unk> to me , and these three words , i know most my uncle ."
"other people <unk> the same , but the <unk> is especially because we see the patients only <unk> ."
"the three words <unk> , do you remember ?"
"&quot; do you remember your patient who was a day , <unk> ? &quot;"
asked the nurse .
"&quot; now she &apos;s back , &quot; she said that in that particular particular <unk> ."
and so she was back .
it was back and die .
"about a hour after they got home after she was home after i was <unk> to <unk> she and <unk> her and <unk> the family , they <unk> back to the <unk> with a <unk> of 50 , and that &apos;s a dangerous <unk> ."
they were hardly <unk> and was blue .
the <unk> <unk> took all these strands .
they gave them their <unk> .
they <unk> them on the <unk> .
"i was <unk> , and <unk> down into the interior ."
"and i <unk> these <unk> because they came to the <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> , and i <unk> to come out ."
"and after two , three days , it clearly <unk> that they &apos;d never <unk> ."
she had a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their family was getting more <unk> .
"but over the course of the next eight or nine days , they were <unk> to the <unk> <unk> ."
"on the day , they were <unk> you -- woman &apos;s day , a woman , her mother and grandmother ."
you say that you never <unk> the names of the <unk> .
and that was the first time i learned this .
"the next weeks , i <unk> myself and i was looking at the first time of shame living shame there on the medical culture -- i felt isolated , literally , <unk> the kind of kind of <unk> , because of a student you can &apos;t talk about it ."
"and you all know the healthy shame if you give a secret to the best friend at best , although that one on a <unk> and then you will get a best friend and <unk> a <unk> <unk> , but the end of a little discussion ."
"if you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> , you never make the mistakes again ."
that &apos;s the kind of <unk> shame .
"and the most interesting kind of <unk> about which i &apos;m talking , is that they do a <unk> of the <unk> ."
"it &apos;s the one that is not saying this that &apos;s not what you made it bad , but you &apos;re really bad ."
"and i feel like this , i felt ."
and i did not have been a reason for my <unk> ; it was very <unk> .
"he was talking to his family , and i &apos;m sure that he <unk> the <unk> and <unk> to make sure i wasn &apos;t going to go ."
"but then , i asked for these questions ."
why have i not ask the <unk> ? why did i put her back home ?
"and then in my worst <unk> , how could i do this kind of funny mistake ?"
why did i go into medicine ?
"so slowly , it &apos;s <unk> ."
i began to feel better .
"and then a <unk> day , it was a hole in the clouds , and the sun <unk> broke down and i may tell me better myself ."
and i <unk> <unk> with that if i made my efforts to <unk> in the <unk> and i never make a mistake that the voice might <unk> .
and she did .
and i was working on .
and then it happened again .
"two years later , i went service in a hospital <unk> hospital in a hospital in a <unk> <unk> north , and i <unk> a <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
it was lots and more go in <unk> .
he was always showing .
"i looked into the kitchen , and it was kind of a little pink ."
and i gave him a <unk> <unk> for him and sent him off .
and he went out when he went out of the door .
"two days later , i came to my final teacher and my <unk> asked me to have the conversation on her office ."
and she said the three words : do you do ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the patient &apos;s <unk> ? &quot;
"it turns out he &apos;s carrying a <unk> <unk> , <unk> ."
he had a fantastic <unk> disease by <unk> .
"you can <unk> that <unk> and it is not an infection of the <unk> of it , it &apos;s not the <unk> and causes the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> ."
"and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die ."
he <unk> <unk> and <unk> a few days later .
"and i went back and i had the same <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and felt <unk> and went back to work , again , and again , back to the work ."
"so in a <unk> room , i &apos;ve <unk> two times a <unk> ."
"there &apos;s a lot of stuff that &apos;s about , especially when you think about the clinic in a hospital working , that was just 14 patients at this time ."
"and in two cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and i probably haven &apos;t had a <unk> in their treatment ."
i &apos;d had to go in with a <unk> .
"my <unk> was at a <unk> of my kidneys , which was there with no <unk> , my colleague at the end of the patient , with the <unk> was <unk> a <unk> at the bottom of the right <unk> ."
the other one had <unk> <unk> .
now i went to <unk> and asked my colleagues to try and put him too <unk> .
and he did and when he <unk> a <unk> <unk> at the right <unk> he called the <unk> .
"and then in two cases , <unk> <unk> , and they went <unk> to them ."
both cases <unk> up to me and <unk> .
"and i &apos;d be happy to tell you that my worst errors are only only <unk> in the first five years of what many of my colleagues say , but <unk> is nonsense ."
so some of my <unk> <unk> in the next few years .
"alone , support and support of support ."
"here &apos;s the trouble : if i can &apos;t go to my <unk> , talking about you if i can &apos;t speak the <unk> voice , it &apos;s really not how much could i come and share with my colleagues ?"
"so , how do i tell you my mistakes , so that didn &apos;t commit the same ?"
so i think if you had a space -- just like me now -- i didn &apos;t see what they feel about me .
when did you hear someone last heard about <unk> about <unk> ?
"oh yeah , you go to a <unk> party , and you like to hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear someone about the own mistakes ."
"if i had a space with a whole bunch of colleagues and i would ask her immediate support , and i had told you what i just was telling you i wouldn &apos;t be a <unk> of the second story , before you were going to be more painful before ."
"and i actually knew that if i had a fellow , i had one <unk> in my hospital had <unk> the right leg away , then i thought that would have had problems with him , in the eyes ."
this is the system where we &apos;re living .
it &apos;s a totally <unk> in mistakes .
it &apos;s one system in which we have two basic <unk> -- these who make the mistakes and the ones that have no make . the people <unk> and <unk> without the ones with bad <unk> and the good ones .
it &apos;s almost a <unk> response to how <unk> that <unk> a person .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we &apos;re doing the kinds of errors of medicine that it is that we have a safe system .
but there are two issues of this .
"in my <unk> 20 years of <unk> and journalism i created an personal medical study on medical mistakes , making false errors to make everything me as a <unk> , i <unk> to the <unk> . &quot;"
and what i learned is that <unk> is absolutely <unk> .
"we &apos;re working in one system every day on the world where one is either <unk> or <unk> is either wrong or less wrong , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and more <unk> and less <unk> or <unk> ."
"in this state , about <unk> , <unk> <unk> were coming back to <unk> ."
"the united states <unk> the <unk> for <unk> cancer is for 100,000 dollars ."
"both <unk> are very powerful , because we don &apos;t look at the problem in the way we should ."
and is the <unk> .
"so in an <unk> in the medicine of all the time , each two to three years , we can &apos;t stay on ."
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t actually <unk> it .
"we have such a cognitive mistake , as we can take a perfect <unk> on the patient for <unk> ."
"and then i take the same patient with <unk> , <unk> it <unk> and <unk> it , and we &apos;ll still take a breath of breath , and a result that &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> <unk> ."
i don &apos;t take that same process .
i &apos;m not a robot . i &apos;m not always doing things right now .
and my patients are no cars ; they tell me their symptoms not the same way .
all of that <unk> are <unk> .
"so if you take the system as i was taught it , and all of them all <unk> <unk> , then there &apos;s no one left left there ."
and know the people who are talking about people who do not want to talk about their worst cases ?
"so i &apos;ve taken <unk> <unk> in my show , black type of stuff , saying , &quot; this is my <unk> mistake &quot; to any mistake from the <unk> to the <unk> , &quot; and i &apos;m my <unk> <unk> . &quot;"
"and then you <unk> your <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> off your head , and you &apos;re looking down and we &apos;re <unk> hard to tell your stories , and you start to tell them ."
"they want to tell her stories , you want to share your stories ."
"they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t do the same kind of mistakes i do . &quot;"
and so what you need is a environment that &apos;s kind of being <unk> in the situation .
and what you needed is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a physician .
"the <unk> <unk> <unk> is a human , knowing his humanity , it &apos;s not <unk> to make mistake , but is everything <unk> to learning from them , so that this could be passed ."
she shares their experience with different .
they &apos;re <unk> when they &apos;re supporting themselves .
"and they show others their mistakes in <unk> not to a <unk> , but in a <unk> , more kind of <unk> , the way everyone is ."
"and it works in a medical science that <unk> that people have the system to fill the system with life , and when this is like this , humans , then <unk> a time of time ."
"so that the system that <unk> around us will make the <unk> that make it more simple mistakes and make people feel so much so it can easily create musical spaces , which can possibly be seen in the environment , in fact , <unk> things and also , in the solutions that means that decisions that can <unk>"
my name is brian <unk> .
i &apos;m <unk> by <unk> .
"and i &apos;m an human , and i make mistakes ."
but i &apos;m <unk> <unk> but i &apos;m trying to learn from learning how to make it <unk> different .
"i &apos;m not <unk> by them , but i can live with them ."
let me finish by three words : i remember .
"i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small <unk> ."
they go to <unk> &apos;s new <unk> .
"and since you can explain that idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories about the time that time you can use ."
"the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes ."
you know he was <unk> here .
"you like to think that <unk> and <unk> , but that is not true ."
it &apos;s actually <unk> the fish .
he described one of the things as highly &quot; . &quot;
it was a <unk> <unk> .
"until the &apos; 80s in <unk> , he went to a big <unk> style ."
it &apos;s now ubiquitous on the red list .
"so this story that we hear a lot from the galapagos or some of other places , which is not very special ."
"yet , we &apos;re still coming in the galapagos ."
we still think they are originally .
the <unk> they &apos;re still <unk> as <unk> .
what &apos;s going on here ?
"the second story should be a different idea called the <unk> <unk> , which is to prove ."
because i <unk> it when i was a <unk> in school in <unk> .
"i got there , because i grew up in europe , and i just wanted to work later in africa ."
i thought i could integrate with me .
"and i had a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i really convinced that i actually couldn &apos;t <unk> up from there ."
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see it &apos;s the <unk> from <unk> and a few <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
"there &apos;s been <unk> of 20 <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> ."
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> and the fishermen were well <unk> to live in ghana well .
"as a year later on there , fish were a <unk> of the <unk> ."
<unk> <unk> her five <unk> .
they had <unk> .
it &apos;s still a fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish had also been lucky for being there .
"so , it hasn &apos;t changed , and yet it changed everything ."
my third little story is what i <unk> tell is about the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the &apos; 70s -- more like the <unk> -- <unk> <unk> many <unk> .
"it meant that countries that started 100 <unk> , started the industrial <unk> <unk> ship , a pretty <unk> ship , of <unk> 4 ."
"and i was walking out and i went all of the southern <unk> ocean , and in particularly the <unk> of <unk> ."
so we didn &apos;t have words for what we were starting to .
and i know that it was the cause of <unk> .
90 percent of our <unk> was over and others that are linked to something that was related to the cause .
and the most of the fish in which little dots were in the <unk> ; they <unk> .
"essentially , the reason we did is on <unk> and it got back ."
"those pictures are extraordinary , because the transition is going to come very quickly , very rapidly ."
"inside one year , we <unk> <unk> and starts with the <unk> ."
"that &apos;s what &apos;s going to do . -- in this case , a <unk> and a <unk> coral will <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
and this is a dead <unk> .
"you &apos;re not going to have no <unk> , you <unk> it out , because they were dead ."
so once we started a <unk> .
it wasn &apos;t even <unk> .
"and they want to kill them , because you could eat them good ."
"in fact , this mountain is <unk> by <unk> every single time they are on the <unk> <unk> , where they have no longer been <unk> to <unk> ."
but it &apos;s not won &apos;t documented .
"we change the world , but we don &apos;t remind ourselves of that ."
"we &apos;re looking at our <unk> <unk> of new level and calling ourselves in <unk> , what was there ."
"and if you put that on it , that &apos;s what happens ."
"and at the <unk> , there are a few good things : <unk> , number of <unk> , the green of your country , the <unk> ."
"and with time , it &apos;s changing , because for the people , people are quite <unk> ."
"every generation looks at the pictures they take on to start a <unk> period , as the standard and will <unk> anything ."
the difference will be the loss .
but they &apos;re not taking <unk> losses .
there can be a order of changes .
"and the other day , they just want to get the <unk> remain silent ."
that &apos;s our first goal right now .
"we want things to get disappeared , the disappeared or things , and things that are not as , as they did ."
"now , you might think that the problem people <unk> , when they were certainly going on in <unk> societies , plants , and they only were able to find a few generations of what they did before ."
"because obviously an animal that was <unk> very often , even before the <unk> ."
"so you don &apos;t get a lot of <unk> animals , so you don &apos;t lose ."
you lose <unk> animals .
and so that &apos;s not the <unk> to this .
"and over time we focus on the large animals and in the sea , the <unk> fish are the great fish ."
"they &apos;re <unk> , because we &apos;re going to start with rare ."
"over time , there &apos;s a bit of fish left and you know , that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> ."
"the question is , why people are <unk> it ."
"well , because it wasn &apos;t enough that it was once different ."
"of course , a lot of people , scientists , will tell you that it was truly different ."
"it will tell you that , because the evidence that you <unk> in one earlier form is not like to <unk> the evidence ."
"for example , <unk> that <unk> that the report in this area <unk> <unk> can be <unk> , can &apos;t be used by <unk> or not <unk> , because he isn &apos;t <unk> . &quot;"
"so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , but we &apos;re in <unk> societies because they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> of past ."
this shows that the big role in which can play <unk> .
"because by the <unk> , we basically put it back into the past , and again , we <unk> ."
"we think the past the past that people can &apos;t understand because the <unk> have changed , and really low <unk> ."
"with that , the people who can see a <unk> and benefit from the <unk> it allowed to <unk> their <unk> ."
"what is that people who are not possible for that , because they don &apos;t have access to -- people in the middle west , to instance ?"
"this is , i think , the art that may fill that gap , maybe <unk> ."
this is the simulation of the <unk> bay area .
"a long time ago , there were <unk> -- 500 years ago ."
"and perhaps the <unk> of <unk> , and they would remember &quot; avatar &quot; . &quot;"
"if you think of &quot; chicken &quot; if you think you &apos;re thinking about why people were so touch with this -- apart from the <unk> , why were they so touched by the <unk> of <unk> ?"
"because it had <unk> , which has lost its way ."
"so my <unk> <unk> , the only one i &apos;m going to do with cameron <unk> , which they turn to the avatar , including water ."
thank you .
"in the &apos; <unk> &apos; 50s , you had to have a <unk> , if we had to have that government <unk> to <unk> ."
they also had to give a piece of sheet of <unk> out of that <unk> .
the reason for it was : government has been <unk> where a text was <unk> .
"they found a paper with <unk> <unk> , they could get their idea to think about that ."
"and we couldn &apos;t understand the west how anybody could do something like it , and the very thing that would be done to free conversation ."
so in our own countries that we &apos;d never been doing something like this .
"but if you buy a new <unk> of the leading <unk> , and you can buy a site of the red light , then the light yellow on every page , in a patterns that lets it down on your <unk> and the site ."
so that &apos;s happening today today .
and that &apos;s not what we don &apos;t seem <unk> .
"and this was one of us , which was our own governments , in terms of using the people who are using their citizens ."
and that is one of the three major <unk> of these today .
so let &apos;s look at what really happened in the world : we cannot have <unk> the attacks .
we have three <unk> .
there is <unk> .
"for example here , this is mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> in the <unk> ."
and the <unk> of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these guys deserve money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money to make the giant bunch of money .
there are multiple cases of <unk> <unk> that <unk> that you have to have money in attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> in <unk> .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
"this is <unk> anderson , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and so on ."
"and they &apos;ve come online and <unk> , and they &apos;ve got <unk> , you &apos;ve <unk> it to use some <unk> to actually <unk> money out , whereas we &apos;re doing our <unk> with our own computer <unk> , our <unk> on a platform of the keyboard ."
"the <unk> <unk> <unk> a second ago the swiss <unk> <unk> from sam <unk> here , was a <unk> , and on that <unk> &apos;s <unk> million dollars than <unk> <unk> ."
"mr. <unk> itself is on <unk> feet , which is a <unk> ."
and what i want you to do today is that we become <unk> of a victim as a <unk> in the real world .
and this is very obvious that this is only going to be even worse .
"in the future , most of them are <unk> online ."
the <unk> who we can observe today is not <unk> by people .
"it &apos;s being motivated through something else , about <unk> , an idea , or by their audiences ."
"the groups are like this <unk> , over the last 12 months and are one of the most <unk> in the field of the <unk> ."
"so , they have three <unk> : they make it for money , and <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> to do the <unk> , but the last group are countries that the attacks <unk> , governments to <unk> the attacks ."
we are the cases that <unk> are .
it turns out to be the <unk> of what &apos;s happening when governments are doing their own citizens .
<unk> is an <unk> <unk> of the <unk> -- it was .
"it was <unk> <unk> , because <unk> had to put together in the next fall ."
"somebody was a teacher , and they did the system <unk> ."
"and last week , i put a meeting with <unk> <unk> <unk> in a new <unk> of what i was going to do is , whether he could have been <unk> for <unk> people , because of the most <unk> people died ."
and his reply was &quot; <unk> . &quot;
"now , what are people going on to die of <unk> like such ?"
<unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what &apos;s you doing to <unk> ?
"now , a business of a <unk> , you need to have a <unk> of service , with the service , <unk> , to take a <unk> ."
"now we take all of these , or lots of ourselves , <unk> or a person of it -- they &apos;re <unk> in <unk> states like iran , where foreign foreign foreign <unk> , because they have <unk> that local government , that they can use more <unk> and the local <unk> , as the local diet , as"
"you can but , if you <unk> around a foreign dish ."
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s happened when it &apos;s happening .
what about arab spring and the things that happen in egypt are .
"well , in egypt , the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , in 1994 , the headquarters <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> . they found a lot of <unk> ."
"in these <unk> , a <unk> was called <unk> ."
"and in this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> a in <unk> government that used the <unk> <unk> government a pair of programs that <unk> them -- <unk> <unk> communications ."
and they had sold that program for free government to <unk> government .
the <unk> <unk> here is .
"so western governments do free governments , to let us stop fighting their lives for their own citizens ."
but western governments help help themselves .
"so for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago , a so-called &quot; <unk> <unk> , that was a <unk> that has been used by <unk> <unk> to their own citizens in <unk> . &quot;"
"if you &apos;re in an <unk> <unk> , you &apos;ll be quite safety <unk> by the telephone ."
"but today , we &apos;re far beyond this ."
they <unk> their <unk> <unk> .
they use resources like the <unk> to <unk> their computer with <unk> that they allow them to monitor their communications and their communication <unk> to collect their <unk> .
"so as if we keep thinking about those things , then the obvious answer to the people might be &quot; right , it sounds bad , but it &apos;s not for me , i &apos;m an <unk> , the citizens of the citizens ."
i don &apos;t worry about it ?
i have no <unk> . &quot;
and this <unk> doesn &apos;t make sense .
there has become <unk> .
privacy is not the debate .
this is not a decision between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
"and as we now , in 2011 , our governments like trust trust , it &apos;s every right , we &apos;ll be out of <unk> , always for ."
"and trust , we <unk> trust one of every future government , an government that may we be in <unk> years ?"
these are the questions we have to deal the next 50 years .
"you may seem strange , but i am a huge <unk> of <unk> ."
the very first <unk> had been produced with the <unk> and the <unk> of a very simple idea : <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> that would fit .
"<unk> were <unk> very , very quickly <unk> , in the world ."
"you <unk> us in to build things that were bigger than us , building <unk> , a <unk> by other ."
basically the <unk> was become the most <unk> in our time .
"nearly hundred years later , <unk> , <unk> , legos ."
it was called it <unk> stone .
"and within less years , lego , <unk> into every household ."
it &apos;s been found that over 400 billion stones has been produced -- or 75 stones for each person on that planet .
"they don &apos;t have a engineer to create beautiful houses , <unk> or beautiful building ."
lego lego <unk> made that for all possible .
"so , lego basically has basically been <unk> the most powerful , the <unk> , made out of <unk> for our imagination ."
"in the meantime the same year , after the bell <unk> <unk> , was <unk> the next revolution , the next <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"the <unk> was a small <unk> that <unk> us from a world of the <unk> building , <unk> to a world that would put everything in the world ."
"and as the <unk> , we allow ourselves to make much more complex , more complex structure to build a <unk> , a stone to a different one ."
"but there &apos;s a <unk> that was a <unk> , and that <unk> was ."
"and i personally <unk> that the <unk> of our <unk> of the time is in experts , and i decided that to change it ."
"so eight years ago i was at the center of media lab , and i began to explore the idea of how to do the engineers of the engineers , and <unk> into it ."
"some years ago , i started to evolve on <unk> ."
let me show you what they &apos;re playing .
<unk> are electronic <unk> that have a specific function .
"they are <unk> , light , <unk> , motor , <unk> ."
and the best thing about this is that they connect with magnet .
so they don &apos;t get them wrong in the way out there .
the rocks are <unk> .
"green is one , blue is power ; it &apos;s pink and orange is ."
"all of them , what it needs to be , is a blue and a green one , and you can get it to very fast and very quickly building <unk> ."
"you put it on green one green , and you can make light ."
"you can switch through the switch , so they built a little <unk> <unk> ."
"take that switch out and you take it from a <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> , and you &apos;ve made a little <unk> ."
"so , put these <unk> into a <unk> effect , and they made a <unk> of a <unk> ."
i will stop that .
"the simple playing <unk> , which is really quite <unk> ."
"instead , you &apos;re going to program , or you need to have a <unk> to allow them to connect with simple , <unk> gestures ."
"so to break this up , <unk> it up . just turn it into this , it just makes it <unk> and <unk> it faster , or slow down ."
the idea behind <unk> is it &apos;s a growing library .
we want any single interaction in the world to bring a <unk> stone .
"lights , <unk> , electrical <unk> , sensors ; anything should be ."
we &apos;ve been <unk> to kids and they see playing with it like this .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
"the most beautiful is how you start that electronics they all have around the world , not learning in school ."
"for example , an <unk> works , or why the doors to the <unk> of the <unk> , or as a <unk> ."
we also brought <unk> to <unk> also .
"so , we have an example from the example of a <unk> experience which started playing together with some material materials ."
"so here we have , with <unk> and papers , <unk> and <unk> , like <unk> ..."
"and we took a few weeks to <unk> , and we gave them <unk> , they had some <unk> that didn &apos;t have the <unk> experience -- just <unk> and paper -- that they said , &quot; what is doing . &quot;"
"so here &apos;s an example of a <unk> you made , a <unk> of <unk> ."
"but wait for them , this is really my favorite story of the <unk> ."
it &apos;s an <unk> <unk> of <unk> who &apos;s <unk> in the dark .
"for those <unk> , <unk> was just another material , electronics was just one more material ."
and we are going to want this material to do this stuff available .
so <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
"you can walk on the <unk> , all <unk> , you can <unk> and you make it ."
"so we want to <unk> the world &apos;s <unk> -- the <unk> , <unk> &apos;s <unk> , and the world , the world in which we live these interactive world , we have a <unk> world ."
"and they go , they go ahead and they &apos;ll start invent ."
thank you .
