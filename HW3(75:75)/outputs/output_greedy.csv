"you know , one of the big <unk> travel and a half of the <unk> research is in common with people who remember the old days , the past , the their own <unk> , the <unk> , the wind in the rain , they <unk> on the rain ."
"and that , that <unk> know , still beyond the milky way , or the importance of <unk> of <unk> , is still full of meaning , or in the himalayas , the himalayas is to the <unk> , is to <unk> that the <unk> of memory is to <unk> ."
"and of course , we all share the same <unk> ."
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re going to bring children to the world .
we &apos;re through <unk> .
"we need to <unk> with the <unk> <unk> through death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , and art ."
"but what &apos;s interesting is the unique <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , the rhythm of the <unk> of the <unk> in every culture ."
"and it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> , or a <unk> in the desert ."
"all of these people teach us that there are other <unk> , other ways to <unk> on earth is there ."
"and that &apos;s an idea that if you think about it , can only get a deal with hope ."
"together , the <unk> cultures of the world are <unk> a web of <unk> and <unk> life that <unk> the earth and is important to be the earth as the biological <unk> that you know as the biosphere ."
"you can imagine this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , and <unk> can imagine when the <unk> of all thoughts and dreams , myths , <unk> and <unk> , who have been defined by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness ."
the <unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
"it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are , and what we &apos;re able to do as an amazing species ."
"and as the biosphere has been <unk> , this happened with the <unk> -- only more of the greater speed ."
"so no <unk> would argue that 50 percent or more than that species before that extinction , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> on the area of <unk> -- very much of the <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , it would be <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> ."
and the <unk> <unk> for this is the extinction of languages .
"when everybody was born in this room , they were talked about <unk> languages ."
"now , a language is not just the <unk> of the <unk> or a series of <unk> ."
a language is the expression of human <unk> .
it &apos;s a means that the soul that finds a particular culture to the most specific place in the world .
"every language is like a <unk> forest of the <unk> , a <unk> , a thought , an ecosystem of opportunity ."
"and from those <unk> languages , today , as we &apos;re sitting in monterey , just half of them , are <unk> to the ears ."
"they &apos;re not taught to be <unk> . that &apos;s called when nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead ."
"what could be as a lonely , as a silence of <unk> , one of the last of your <unk> , to speak that your language , don &apos;t have to have the wisdom of the ancestors of ancestors , or to expect hope for hope ?"
"and yet , this terrible fate of the world actually <unk> someone anywhere on earth , about two weeks , because of all of the two weeks , a <unk> of older and <unk> a older language to the grave ."
"and i know some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t we have a better place in the world if we all speak a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; do you want to be this language ."
let &apos;s be a rock . &quot;
and then you would see suddenly how if you could not speak your language .
"so i want to take you through a journey of <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> to try to try to make them <unk> , which is actually lost ."
"now there are some of us who <unk> to say that i , when i say , &quot; different ways of being , &quot; really different possibilities of his own ."
"take this child &apos;s <unk> in the northwest of the <unk> , the people of the <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from the east of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> ."
"this is a people that doesn &apos;t be cognitively <unk> between the colors and green , because the forest is the forest that &apos;s <unk> from the forest is <unk> by people ."
"they have a <unk> language , and a <unk> called the <unk> <unk> , you have to marry someone who talks to another language ."
"all of this <unk> in the <unk> past , the <unk> of these big houses , where the <unk> are spoken to six or seven languages , but that &apos;s never one person to hear a language that learns ."
they &apos;re just listening to and start to speak .
"or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the <unk> of <unk> , the amazing people that were <unk> in the year , <unk> ."
"in <unk> , five <unk> were trying to <unk> and made a <unk> mistake ."
"they had <unk> <unk> photos from the air that would be <unk> as a <unk> gesture , and they <unk> that these people from the rainforest never saw anything <unk> in their lives ."
"they were <unk> these photographs from <unk> , trying to see the face , or seeing the character , they found nothing and <unk> that they were killing the <unk> and killed the five <unk> of the <unk> ."
but the <unk> were not killing only <unk> with the <unk> .
they <unk> each other .
<unk> percent of the deaths happened by <unk> .
"we <unk> the <unk> eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural <unk> , and when we <unk> people with <unk> , they gave them something about it that one of the people became so old he died because of his age , and we were killing him ."
"but at the same time , they had a clear <unk> of the <unk> ."
"their <unk> could smell the <unk> of an animal that was 40 <unk> distance , and determine what the <unk> of that was ."
"in the early &apos; 70s , i got a really amazing job when my professor asked me to do whether i was interested in haiti and going to go to the secret societies that was <unk> the foundation of <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> ."
"and to give that <unk> , i had to have to have some of these remarkable belief about this remarkable belief that is the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> is not a <unk> of black magic ."
it &apos;s a complex <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s interesting .
"if i would ask you , the big <unk> , what would you say ?"
"<unk> , islam , <unk> , <unk> , whatever ."
"a continent will always be <unk> because the <unk> was that in sub-saharan africa , of course , there was a <unk> and <unk> is just the most <unk> of this very profound religious thought that the <unk> in the <unk> in the diaspora ."
but what &apos;s so interesting is that these living relationship is between the living and the dead .
living <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
"the <unk> can be <unk> by the large water from the large water , respond to the rhythm of the rhythm to <unk> the soul of living , so that the <unk> is going to <unk> for a short moment to god ."
"<unk> <unk> like the <unk> , &quot; your white goes to the church and you talk about god ."
"we dance in the temple , and we become god . &quot;"
and because you &apos;re obsessed with being taken by the mind . how can you get done ?
"look at this amazing <unk> : <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> coal without any <unk> , an amazing <unk> of the body to influence the body so that it <unk> in a state of <unk> that it becomes <unk> in the extreme <unk> ."
"now , from all of the people i &apos;ve met , the rock of the sierra <unk> de <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> ."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> civilization , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , in a <unk> of this people , <unk> this people in a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> ."
"in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones that were never <unk> from the <unk> ."
"until today , they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> <unk> . the education is very extraordinary ."
"the young <unk> are separated from three and four years from their families and in a <unk> world , in <unk> , in <unk> for 18 years , two <unk> , <unk> by <unk> , two years , <unk> by the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> by nine months ."
"and throughout the time , they &apos;re <unk> into the values of their society , the values that <unk> the claim that their <unk> and only their <unk> , their <unk> , or we could say the <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> ."
"at the end of this amazing <unk> , you &apos;ll suddenly take out of a day and first time in your life , at the age of 18 years , see a <unk> , and in this <unk> moment she <unk> her <unk> , when she <unk> the beauty begins to the sun begins to be <unk> of the"
it &apos;s so wonderful . you need to protect it . &quot;
"they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world ."
now this level of <unk> is very important .
"whenever we think about <unk> and landscape , we &apos;re actually <unk> the <unk> and the old <unk> of the <unk> , which is a <unk> thought , or in the other hand , or , these are more of the people that are connected to nature as we ."
"so , <unk> are not <unk> , nor are <unk> by the <unk> ."
"it doesn &apos;t stay in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> or the cold <unk> , but they still have a <unk> <unk> of the earth and an ritual that can &apos;t be aware of the idea of the earth , but it &apos;s being <unk> to a <unk> ."
"well , what does that mean ?"
"it means that a little child from the <unk> that <unk> in the belief is a <unk> , that will be a <unk> , his <unk> , a different human being , and become a different relationship , or a different relationship of that resource or a country ."
"whether he &apos;s a <unk> of a <unk> or a bunch of <unk> , <unk> ."
the interesting thing is the metaphor that is called the relationship between the individual and the nature .
i grew up in the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> and believed that these forests are there to become <unk> .
"and that made me to another person as my friends , who believe that these forests , that the <unk> of <unk> are <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , who are the most <unk> of the world , would be <unk> to their <unk> , <unk> ."
"now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different <unk> , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this one plant ."
it &apos;s a photograph that i just took last april in the amazon in the amazon .
"this is <unk> , from many of you have heard , the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> ."
"what <unk> does is not just the <unk> potential of this <unk> of <unk> , but it &apos;s really made by two different sources . on the site , there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,"
"and this plant contains some very strong <unk> that <unk> the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are very similar ."
"if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this stuff that &apos;s <unk> you &apos;re using in different ways ."
"this <unk> <unk> is about how from a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> on a sea of electricity ."
"it &apos;s not being <unk> from reality , but the resolution of reality ."
"i even <unk> with my professor , richard <unk> , who <unk> the <unk> with the discovery of the magic <unk> in mexico in the <unk> years , which i <unk> to tell you that was not a <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , so you could not <unk> ."
"but the thing about <unk> is that they can &apos;t be <unk> , because they &apos;re <unk> by a human <unk> , of course , by <unk> <unk> , <unk> ."
"they can only be <unk> with some other chemicals , the mao <unk> <unk> the mao ."
"now the fascinating thing is that the <unk> that are <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> of the kind of things that are necessary , that &apos;s necessary to <unk> the <unk> . ask yourself ."
"how can these people find from a <unk> of <unk> <unk> plants that find two <unk> plants that , if they can do this way , a kind of <unk> version of <unk> version , so that the whole is the whole of its parts ?"
"we use these great <unk> , trying to try and make mistakes that <unk> ."
"but what you ask is the indian people say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;"
so what does that mean ?
"this tribe , the <unk> , <unk> , 17 <unk> of <unk> that you see in the forest of all of the distance in the forest , which seem like a kind of <unk> ."
"and then you ask them , how they <unk> their <unk> and they say , &quot; i thought i was going to understand something about plants ."
"i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;"
so it turns out that you &apos;re all <unk> each of the 17 <unk> in <unk> and you &apos;re singing in a different <unk> .
"now , this is not a <unk> in harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> ."
"now , the <unk> problem is that even of the ones that have <unk> for the <unk> , have the <unk> , they have <unk> and <unk> , they &apos;re sort of looking at the past , as the world , our physical , our world ."
"so , the fact is that you remember the 20th century , 300 years , not <unk> , or technological innovations , but rather than a era we had been <unk> and the massive <unk> of the <unk> of the world , and the massive diversity of cultural diversity ."
"all cultures , again , have been involved in the dance with new <unk> ."
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> don &apos;t hear less about the sioux than they <unk> and arrow and arrow to be the <unk> americans as being american and <unk> .
"not change change and technology is the integrity of the <unk> , and it is power . the <unk> face of <unk> ."
"and whatever you get in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not <unk> . these are dynamic living peoples that are <unk> by forces , whose own forces that <unk> to <unk> the capacity to <unk> their capacity ."
"or if we go to the mountains of <unk> , where i &apos;m going to see much more <unk> , you will see the <unk> face of political <unk> ."
"you know , the genocide , the <unk> of people will <unk> in general , but the <unk> , the destruction of the lifestyle , is not just not <unk> , but in general as part of a <unk> ."
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering from the <unk> when you don &apos;t have the <unk> level .
"i went to a young colleagues with <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> <unk> to <unk> , and i first came to <unk> when i was behind the face of the statistics of which you hear from <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> into <unk> and <unk> ."
the father of this young <unk> was <unk> as <unk> as the <unk> of the <unk> .
"that meant that during the chinese <unk> , he was immediately killed ."
"his uncle , with their <unk> in the diaspora , <unk> people to nepal ."
his mother was <unk> as a <unk> for being <unk> for <unk> .
"he was <unk> in the age of two in jail for <unk> under her <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live without her life ."
the sister who did this <unk> was brought into a <unk> .
one day they <unk> on a <unk> <unk> and they had to <unk> them for seven years in a <unk> <unk> .
"the suffering can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people is something more <unk> ."
"and at the end of the point we &apos;re really in a choice . we want to be in a <unk> world of <unk> , or in a <unk> world of diversity ?"
"<unk> <unk> , the big <unk> , before she died , that it &apos;s their biggest fear that as we move towards a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , we were not only <unk> the whole range of human imagination , but we would see a different <unk> <unk> ."
"and it &apos;s <unk> to think that our species may have existed for 600,000 years ."
"the <unk> revolution , which brought us agriculture , and we ended up with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> -- just <unk> 10,000 years ago ."
the modern industrial world like we know it &apos;s not 300 years old .
"now , this <unk> story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we are in the <unk> ."
"if we ask these <unk> <unk> to the importance of the <unk> , they respond to 10,000 different voices ."
"and in this song , we will be the possibility of being what we &apos;re going to be , people with <unk> consciousness that are aware of all the way that people and all the way to be <unk> and a lot of <unk> and brain ."
"here &apos;s a picture i took the <unk> end of the <unk> when i went to the <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather ."
"the <unk> government is not always very good with the <unk> and the <unk> years , while the <unk> of our <unk> , they were forced to pull into <unk> ."
the grandfather &apos;s <unk> man &apos;s <unk> .
"the family , the fear of his life , took him all the guns and all the tools ."
now you have to know that the <unk> don &apos;t have fear of the cold . they <unk> them to their advantage .
the <unk> of their <unk> were <unk> from fish that was made in <unk> .
the grandfather of men &apos;s man is not <unk> night or the <unk> storm .
"he <unk> out , <unk> his <unk> <unk> and <unk> his hand , and when the <unk> started , he started <unk> , he <unk> them into the shape of a <unk> ."
"he <unk> <unk> on the pages of the <unk> , and when it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog ."
"he took the dog and <unk> , and he took the skeleton of the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> , <unk> a dog , <unk> a dog on the <unk> , and he <unk> the <unk> <unk> ."
that &apos;s how you do something out of something .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the <unk> and all of the <unk> in the world .
the government had <unk> government in april <unk> in april of <unk> control over a area that &apos;s bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country &apos;s home and called <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> area . it &apos;s all <unk> .
"an amazing example of how a nation , a state that can be <unk> with his <unk> and reach ."
"and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to , at least for the ones that have been to come to this distant goals from earth to realize that they &apos;re not even removed at all ."
they &apos;re the <unk> of somebody .
"they represent the human imagination that <unk> in <unk> times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like our dreams are part of the way of our own children are part of the hope ."
and what we &apos;re trying to do with national geographic is that we don &apos;t believe that politicians never do anything .
"we think <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not <unk> , but we believe that <unk> can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for <unk> in the world . our website is a dozen million <unk> a month ."
<unk> nations are sending our <unk> .
our magazines will be read by millions .
"and we <unk> a series of <unk> to the <unk> we take on the audience to places that we have in such cultural <unk> , that they will come from the <unk> and hopefully to make them <unk> to the other <unk> of the world that the most <unk> world <unk> that we actually <unk> that <unk> that <unk>"
thank you .
"what i &apos;m going to show you , as quickly as i &apos;m going to show you , is the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;re <unk> as a <unk> in front of a year , <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> in a genetic environment ."
"we see a lot , many , many <unk> of the digital <unk> here that you can <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , can <unk> in a way ."
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we think about how big these <unk> are or how big the images are .
"most of them are digital <unk> of a camera , but this is an example of the <unk> of the <unk> and it &apos;s in a field of 300 <unk> ."
"it doesn &apos;t make difference , because the only thing that the performance of a system like that i can do is to <unk> the number of <unk> on their screen at every moment , and it has a very flexible architecture ."
"this is a whole book , an example of <unk> ."
this is <unk> house from <unk> . every <unk> is a chapter .
"to prove that it really is about text and not a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real <unk> of <unk> and a picture ."
maybe this is a kind of artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t <unk> it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
"and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a <unk> of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of <unk> medium ."
we also did something about the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
"we &apos;ve designed a false <unk> with very high <unk> , which is much higher than a normal ad , and we have some <unk> content ."
"if you want to see the functions of these cars , you can see here ."
"or other models , or even <unk> <unk> ."
and this really <unk> these ideas to <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the screen .
we hope that that that doesn &apos;t mean <unk> and other <unk> -- that &apos;s not necessary to be .
"of course , the <unk> is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this ."
"and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to do this area too ."
but these are all the streets in the <unk> .
<unk> up on the <unk> image of nasa .
so let &apos;s get a little bit of <unk> now .
this is actually live in the internet . you can <unk> it .
"this is a project called <unk> , which is actually two different technologies together ."
"the one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research on <unk> , who <unk> from noah , a <unk> of washington , under the <unk> of steve <unk> at <unk> ."
and rick <unk> <unk> &apos;s research was done . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
"you can see that , if we can create this kind of <unk> that we can <unk> through images and make that experience of the <unk> <unk> ."
but the <unk> <unk> of the images is actually in fact .
"the <unk> have these pictures together <unk> them the real room , where these pictures that all over the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> were made to the <unk> <unk> . they see here of <unk> elements , or <unk> , and these <unk> , and they all these <unk> ."
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m still having to show you other environments .
there are which which are much more <unk> .
"i &apos;d like to show you one of the <unk> <unk> of noah , and this is from a early <unk> of <unk> we &apos;ve been working in summer to show you what i think that &apos;s actually <unk> the technology that is not what we &apos;re looking behind ."
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
"this is a <unk> of the cathedral , <unk> , who just <unk> pictures with images of <unk> , just give them <unk> in <unk> and they become images of men in <unk> and on the <unk> , and on the <unk> show a <unk> , and every <unk> model ."
"so these are all <unk> , and they &apos;re all <unk> in this way ."
and we can <unk> this very simple way .
"you know , i &apos;ve never believed that i will work at microsoft work ."
i &apos;m very grateful for the <unk> here .
". i suspect you can see that these are many different kinds of cameras : all of them are <unk> to professional <unk> , a pretty large number of them all in the environment that were all <unk> ."
"and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the <unk> ."
many of you are <unk> with faces and so on .
there &apos;s a series of photographs -- here &apos;s a series of photographs .
"this is actually a poster by <unk> lady , which was <unk> ."
we can change the <unk> from a physical <unk> of this environment .
"the point is that we can do things with social environment , and it &apos;s going to be collected from all the data -- from the whole <unk> of it , like visual <unk> -- and everything is <unk> connected to each other ."
all these photos are <unk> connected and it creates something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of the earth .
consider this as the sequel to the sequel of stephen <unk> earth &apos;s <unk> .
"and that &apos;s something that &apos;s using the complexity , with which people use it , and it <unk> the user , for the use of use , is increasingly bigger ."
their own photos are <unk> with <unk> <unk> that <unk> another person .
"if someone &apos;s <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all of these <unk> and <unk> who are all of them , my photograph is <unk> with all this data , and i can use them as <unk> , and i can use them into this room , in the space , and <unk> ."
"and of course , all of those are the <unk> <unk> <unk> of every interesting component of the earth that were not only <unk> or <unk> and so forth , but have been <unk> by collective <unk> ."
thank you .
"do i understand it ? your software is allowed to have a certain point in a certain time , within the next years , all of the pictures that are used in the world in common with one principle ?"
yes . she does nothing else to explore .
if you want to create them between the images .
and she does this because of the <unk> in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> information that have many of these pictures .
"so , as if you do a <unk> for images , where you put <unk> in and you put the text of the website a lot of information about what that &apos;s the picture ."
but how would it be if you &apos;re connected to the image of all of your images ?
"then the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> that makes it happen , it &apos;s really <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> ."
"blaise , that &apos;s really incredibly incredible . congratulations ."
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book that i hope in <unk> with other things that you &apos;ve heard . and i &apos;m going to try to create a few connections if you &apos;ve not noticed .
i want to start with what i call &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the <unk> <unk> of what ?
"the <unk> of all <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> societies ."
"the <unk> <unk> works like this : when our goal is to the <unk> of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the <unk> of the freedom of freedom ."
"the reason for that is that freedom is good in itself , make valuable , a <unk> <unk> of human ."
"if people have freedom , then each of us to do things for themselves , to make the things that our <unk> and nobody has to decide ."
the way to <unk> freedom is to <unk> choice .
"the more <unk> people , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more they have <unk> ."
"this is , i think , so deep in our <unk> that it would not come to mind ."
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress allows us .
this is my <unk> . no big one .
i just want to say a little bit about <unk> .
"there &apos;s a <unk> in my <unk> , if you don &apos;t <unk> the 10 extra <unk> and 12 <unk> that you could buy a large number of <unk> in your <unk> , in the <unk> case , that no one in the <unk> store you &apos;re right ."
so this is like the <unk> .
"and then they go to the <unk> business to <unk> a <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , radio . and in this business there &apos;s a lot of <unk> plants ."
we can <unk> <unk> million different <unk> of the components that are offered in this business .
you have to think that &apos;s a big <unk> .
in other areas of -- the world of communication .
"there was a time when i was a boy , because you could have <unk> to everybody that was like to go away from <unk> bell bell ."
they have their phone phone <unk> . they don &apos;t buy it .
and the result of that was that the phone never broke .
these days are over .
"we have almost an infinite <unk> that have phones , especially in the world &apos;s mobile phones ."
these are the mobile phones of the future .
"my <unk> is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> ."
"and if you haven &apos;t seen that in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;ll soon be ."
and what it does is it <unk> people to run the business and ask that question .
"now , you know what the answer to this question is ?"
the answer is no no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a <unk> that doesn &apos;t do much .
"in other aspects of life that are much more <unk> than buying <unk> , the same <unk> of the choice of choice ."
health -- it &apos;s not longer the case in the united states that you &apos;re going to the doctor and you &apos;re going to ask you to do what &apos;s going to do .
"instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says to them , we could do a or we could make b ."
a has these benefits and risks .
b has all the benefits and risks . what do you want ?
"and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i want to do ? &quot;"
"the doctor says , a has the benefits and the risks , and b has the benefits and risk ."
what do you want to do ?
"and if you say , &quot; if you were i , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;"
"the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;"
"the result is -- we call it &quot; autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a <unk> of responsibility for someone &apos;s decision to make something of someone &apos;s <unk> -- not to someone &apos;s <unk> -- and the patient &apos;s best person ."
"there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for <unk> drugs for people like you and me , if you think about it , no sense of power , because we don &apos;t buy them ."
why don &apos;t we buy them when we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : you expect to go from the doctor &apos;s <unk> and ask a change of the <unk> .
something like our identity as our identity is a question of the choice to show how this slide is .
"we don &apos;t <unk> identity , we <unk> them ."
and we &apos;re going to <unk> ourselves as often .
"that means that every day you have to go to the morning , you have to decide what you want to be like a kind of person ."
"in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in the <unk> that was almost everybody had , and they could <unk> as fast as they could , and then they could quickly get as quickly as kids as they could ."
"the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that ."
"now , all of you today is just too simple ."
"i teach wonderful smart students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to do ."
"and they &apos;re not <unk> because they &apos;re less <unk> , and they &apos;re less carefully ."
"it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy doing things with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i get married ? shouldn &apos;t i marry ?"
"should i marry later ? should i have children , or do i do a career ? &quot;"
they &apos;re all <unk> questions .
"and you will answer these questions , whether it means all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you and not a good note in my class ."
"and in fact , they should do that . they are important questions to <unk> ."
"work -- we &apos;re blessed , like carl <unk> , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every day on the planet -- to the <unk> hotel ."
"there &apos;s one corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about , that the <unk> system works ."
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
"so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , again and again , if we should work or not work ."
"we can play our kids at the <unk> play , and we have our mobile phone on the one , and our <unk> on the <unk> to others , and our laptop probably would be on our own ."
"and even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute we ask our child at the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i call this call ?"
should i write this letter ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
"and even the answer to the question is , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly been <unk> by your experience of your child &apos;s experience very different from the time ."
"all the place where we <unk> , big things and small , <unk> things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice ."
and the world in which we lived in .
"so i want to say , there were some <unk> , but not all of you were a question ."
and the world in which we now look like this .
"and the question is , is the good news or bad news ?"
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
"we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to get to what bad about it is ."
"all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people ."
"a effect , <unk> way , is that it &apos;s <unk> <unk> instead ."
"so with so many <unk> of the <unk> you can choose , it <unk> people to even decide ."
"i &apos;m going to give you another <unk> example , a study of investment in volunteers ."
"one <unk> of me had access to <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of about a million <unk> and about 2,000 different jobs ."
"and what she found was 10 <unk> that the company <unk> , took the participation by two percent ."
"they offer 50 <unk> -- 10 percent less employees , part of the time they &apos;re giving five to them . why ?"
"because it &apos;s 50 <unk> that are <unk> to the <unk> , it &apos;s so hard to decide what to choose it is to go to tomorrow ."
"and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and , of course , never ."
"understand that it &apos;s not just that people have to eat <unk> when they go into the <unk> , because they don &apos;t have enough money to <unk> , it means the decisions that they make so hard to make their <unk> company ."
"by not having <unk> them up to 5,000 dollars a year from the <unk> that would have been happy to <unk> their contribution ."
paralysis is a consequence of many <unk> .
and i think it <unk> to the world that looks like this .
"they really want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s <unk> for all of you , right ?"
"they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong <unk> , or they &apos;re <unk> the wrong thing ."
"so that &apos;s a effect . the other effect is that even if we get the paralysis and a decision , we end less <unk> with the outcome of the <unk> , as if we had the opportunity to make up less choices between ."
and there are several reasons for this .
"one of them is <unk> by the great <unk> <unk> , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which <unk> is perfect ? it just turns out that they could have a decision to make better . and she would have better make it better decision better decision ."
"the more opportunities there are , the more the more the time it &apos;s not about regret is the <unk> for the choice you meet ."
"second , what economists call <unk> ."
"dan <unk> did a big point in this morning by telling how much the way we <unk> things , depends on what we compare it ."
"all right , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to remember , it &apos;s just <unk> <unk> properties of alternatives that <unk> them that makes them less <unk> with the alternatives they &apos;ve chosen ."
"here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorker , i &apos;m <unk> ."
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of <unk> .
very expensive <unk> .
<unk> beach . great day . they have it all for themselves .
"what could be better ? &quot; <unk> the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s <unk> ."
everyone in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could go to the house right . &quot;
and he spends two weeks of the thought he <unk> the possibility of having a lot of time to have a great parking lot of the day .
"<unk> down the <unk> that we get through our <unk> , even if we &apos;ve been <unk> ."
"and the more opportunities to the <unk> , the more <unk> of these <unk> are going to take into the <unk> ."
here &apos;s another example .
"now , this <unk> does some of the <unk> ."
he &apos;s going to be a statement about life now and maybe to do things slowly .
"but a key point that he does is always : always who they decide for one thing , don &apos;t decide to do other things ."
"and these other things like many <unk> properties , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re going to do less <unk> ."
three : <unk> expectations .
this was a <unk> when i wanted to <unk> my <unk> .
"i <unk> <unk> , almost all the time ."
"and there was a time in which there was only a <unk> of a kind of , and they bought it , and they were <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> , and if they had long enough , and they had started <unk> , &quot; they were <unk> . &quot;"
"so , to buy new <unk> , after many years of the old <unk> , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some <unk> , here &apos;s my size . &quot;"
"and the <unk> said , &quot; do you want <unk> , easy or <unk> ?"
do you want to buttons or <unk> ? stone <unk> ?
do you want to have <unk> <unk> ?
"they want to <unk> down far , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; and so on ."
"my <unk> was down , and after i <unk> , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like the way that the first time was the same . &quot;"
"he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour so i spent all these <unk> <unk> , and i <unk> the business -- and i &apos;ll tell the truth -- with the <unk> <unk> that i had ever had ."
i had better . all of those <unk> allowed me to have better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it myself .
"the reason i felt was worse with all these opportunities , all of my expectations of what was going on for a good <unk> ."
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when they were in a kind of way .
"when they came in 100 species , <unk> , should have been perfect by them ."
"and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect ."
"and so i had the <unk> of what i had expected to do , and what i was the <unk> of compared to what i was expected ."
and the <unk> of opportunities in life is <unk> people <unk> the expectations of how well they have to be about this .
"and this leads to less <unk> with the <unk> , even though the results are good ."
"no one in the world of the <unk> knows this , because if you knew you all wouldn &apos;t know what it is ."
the truth is more like this .
"the reason is that it was better than anything bad , when everything was bad , it was possible for people to do the experience of being a <unk> surprise ."
"today , in the world we live -- we have <unk> <unk> , with <unk> as an expectation -- the best for you can ever hope that &apos;s as good as you might be expected of them ."
"they will never feel <unk> because their expectations , my expectations , are <unk> ."
the secret to <unk> -- which came to what they all have to be -- the secret for <unk> is low expectations .
"i want to say -- a short moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really , really wonderful ."
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t have <unk> myself .
but <unk> is not always that bad thing .
"and finally , a consequence of the <unk> of a bad <unk> , if there &apos;s only one of the kind of <unk> that &apos;s <unk> when you &apos;re <unk> , and you ask yourself why , who &apos;s the answer , the world is <unk> ."
"when hundreds of different kinds of <unk> are available , and you buy one of the <unk> is the <unk> , and you ask why , who is responsible ?"
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : you know .
they could have better do it .
"with 100 different kinds of <unk> in the <unk> , there are no excuse for mistakes ."
"and so , if people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about them , they <unk> themselves ."
clinical trials in the last year in the last generation .
"i think a <unk> -- not the only one , but a <unk> <unk> to this <unk> of depression , and also <unk> , is that people have learned the <unk> are so high because their own standards are so <unk> , and then when they think they think they &apos;re <unk> their experience that experience them ."
"and so the <unk> that it &apos;s actually about , generally , <unk> us , and we feel bad ."
so let me remind you .
"this is the <unk> <unk> that we all hold of it for right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true ."
"there &apos;s no question , which is a bit better than not , but it doesn &apos;t <unk> , which is better than something that is more <unk> ."
there &apos;s a <unk> lot . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve missed this point a lot of the <unk> that we &apos;ve <unk> .
"now , as a <unk> question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a <unk> question that is about thinking about the . what all of these <unk> <unk> is in the developed developed societies is the wealth of wealth ."
"there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them , whose problem is not the problem ."
your problem is that they have too little .
"so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , <unk> societies ."
"and what &apos;s so <unk> and <unk> is , steve <unk> told you about how this <unk> and hard to <unk> <unk> doesn &apos;t help . it &apos;s a <unk> of money ."
"what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them ."
they even do <unk> .
you &apos;re getting worse about that .
"if something of what people do so much of our society makes so much decisions to make societies in the societies that people would have <unk> to <unk> , not only would live to life , but will become better ."
economists call this a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is going to worry about all the way -- not just the poor -- because all of these big <unk> <unk> us .
"<unk> , please read this <unk> , and a <unk> person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish ?"
you know nothing possible in this <unk> . &quot;
"<unk> <unk> , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i &apos;ve first read it ."
"but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the point that the fish knows something ."
"because the truth is that if you &apos;re <unk> the <unk> so that it &apos;s possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you &apos;ve got paralysis ."
"if you break the <unk> , it &apos;s possible to reduce the <unk> ."
they increase the paralysis and down the <unk> .
everybody needs a <unk> .
"this is almost limited to limited security -- perhaps for the fish , definitely for us ."
"but the <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> , and i suspect , and , of course , disaster ."
thank you very much .
"you know , i &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that could mean , and about the discovery of new genes ."
"in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve got the biology and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code in a new phase of biology by creating new lives and building ."
we &apos;ve always tried to ask major questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think that many <unk> have tried to understand and do this on different levels of scale .
we have tried different <unk> to simplify the <unk> components .
we &apos;ve been <unk> almost 20 years . we &apos;ve sequenced the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the world &apos;s <unk> from the <unk> world of biology .
"now , let &apos;s try to ask whether we can live lives or can we make new life , from this digital universe ?"
"this is a map of a small organism , <unk> <unk> , who can have the smallest genome that can <unk> itself in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to reach this with a smaller genome ."
we &apos;ve done it to about a hundred genes that have been <unk> by 500 or so that are here .
"but if we look at this <unk> map that &apos;s very simple , compared to our . trust me , that &apos;s easy . but if we look at all of these genes that we look at the other <unk> , it &apos;s very unlikely to be that virus ."
"so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go forward , and that &apos;s actually to be able to turn into a <unk> , which allows us to change the <unk> and so to ask some of these <unk> questions ."
"and so we started with the question , can we make a <unk> ?"
does it allow the chemistry to really big molecules to make what never been done before ?
"and if we can do that , we can start the <unk> ?"
a <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material .
our steps were exponentially <unk> of life .
"and our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly but still increased , and our last point of <unk> , would be put on a <unk> curve ."
we started this 15 years ago .
it took a couple of years from now to a <unk> <unk> before we did the first experiments .
and it turns out that it &apos;s very difficult to do .
"there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that little pieces can make , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece of mistake ."
so we had to develop a new method that we could put these little pieces together and put the mistakes together .
"this was our first trial , starting from the digital information , the genome <unk> x prize , <unk> <unk> ."
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
"we made little pieces , we made a <unk> , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters ."
"the <unk> phase came when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> and took a <unk> , and the <unk> started to read the genetic code and <unk> <unk> particles ."
"the <unk> particles were <unk> by the cells , and then they were killed and killed e."
"i recently talked to the <unk> , and they said they were <unk> this model ."
they &apos;re <unk> more than you &apos;re doing here .
"so we think that &apos;s a situation in the software , in fact , can actually build your own <unk> system into a <unk> system ."
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a <unk> <unk> <unk> . it &apos;s got more than <unk> genetic code . so we thought we could build it in <unk> of the size of the virus that could change the size of the <unk> .
"design is the key , and if you start with digital information in the computer , this digital information really has to be really <unk> ."
"when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the <unk> of 1995 was that we had 10,000 <unk> in a <unk> <unk> ."
"we found that in <unk> , 30 mistakes , if we used the <unk> sequence of <unk> , it would have never been possible ."
"part of the <unk> is to create pieces that are 50 letters long , and the other <unk> of the <unk> are <unk> to build smaller <unk> so that they would fit ."
we have unique elements of elements in there .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve got <unk> in .
"think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , <unk> and <unk> ."
"<unk> this letter -- this letter <unk> about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s one of these amino acids , for each of these amino acids ."
"so we can use the genetic code to write our words , <unk> , thoughts ."
we just <unk> <unk> .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
"we &apos;ve got the pieces so that we could just <unk> them with <unk> , and there &apos;s <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them ."
"and we started making pieces together , starting with <unk> , <unk> the <unk> letters to <unk> , to make these <unk> of <unk> to <unk> them back to <unk> them ."
"in each step , we &apos;ve made these pieces of <unk> so we could make them <unk> because we tried to create a very <unk> process that they &apos;re going to see in a minute ."
we tried to get the <unk> point .
so this looks like a <unk> .
"if we get to these right <unk> -- with 100,000 <unk> -- they &apos;re not just going to grow e. , all of them are <unk> , all the opportunities for the modern <unk> , and we put other <unk> in other ways ."
"we knew from a <unk> <unk> called <unk> , using biology to repair dna that can make dna <unk> these pieces ."
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s a organism called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the three million <unk> of radiation .
you &apos;re looking at the top of its <unk> that your <unk> is simply <unk> apart .
"12 to 24 hours later , it was all <unk> again as <unk> ."
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
"these organisms can be completely <unk> , they can even live in <unk> ."
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in <unk> and can move to search for <unk> conditions .
"in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there ."
"this is a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these <unk> <unk> -- actually , we just used <unk> using the right design of the pieces of design , and we put it together together , and then it automatically <unk> together ."
this is not a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
these are pictures of a <unk> over six seconds .
that &apos;s the <unk> we &apos;ve just done recently recently .
"these are over <unk> letters in <unk> , and it &apos;s the biggest molecule with <unk> that has ever been created by people ."
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
"if we had 10 times in <unk> and <unk> to 10 times as if it would be <unk> <unk> sites , it would just to <unk> these genetic code ."
"now , how do we start a <unk> ? how do we <unk> ?"
"obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , it &apos;s very simple . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria ."
"it &apos;s also easy when you &apos;re in <unk> how we do it , you just take the <unk> out and you get a different place , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about the <unk> ."
"in <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> in the cell , but we just recently showed that you can do a complete <unk> of a cell phone from another . and that can <unk> the <unk> ."
"we <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> . and <unk> , these two <unk> are <unk> from the other people like mice . we gave some <unk> to that <unk> , we could <unk> it with <unk> , and we were <unk> it into a very <unk> of all of it ."
the new <unk> was going to the cell .
"in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we tried to bring this process a little bit further ."
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
"we find all kinds of species here that &apos;s a second <unk> <unk> or a <unk> of <unk> , every time , in one second , <unk> in one second ."
so people who imagine evolution as a gene has been <unk> much of biology .
there are <unk> that are called the <unk> that are actually <unk> dna .
"the <unk> that was in the cell , none . the chromosomes we &apos;ve already got it ."
"it was <unk> in the cell and realized the other <unk> as a <unk> material , and so we had only one cell with a new <unk> ."
it <unk> blue because of the genes we &apos;ve put it in .
"and after a very short time , it had lost all the species of species and <unk> completely into a new species based on the new software that we have in the cell ."
"all the proteins were <unk> to the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve been <unk> ."
"it may sound like the genome of <unk> , but we can move through the <unk> , things quite dramatic change ."
now i have a <unk> that this is not the <unk> -- that &apos;s based on <unk> billion years of evolution .
and i have a <unk> that we may have a new form of <unk> design design that could be put into a new <unk> based on digital design .
why should we do this ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to what we need .
we &apos;re <unk> by nine billion people in the next 40 years .
"to put it in my context , i was born in <unk> ."
"today , three people on this planet are still in <unk> for each year ; within 40 years , it &apos;ll be four ."
"we have problems with <unk> , with <unk> and <unk> water , <unk> , <unk> billion people ."
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for nine .
"we need about five billion of coal , <unk> billion <unk> oil . that &apos;s a hundred million <unk> a day ."
"if we think about biological <unk> or replacing any process of replacing it , it becomes a huge challenge ."
"then , of course , there &apos;s all of co2 from this material that &apos;s going into the atmosphere ."
"we now have from our discoveries of the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that the <unk> of the future ."
the <unk> had a dozen components and see the diversity that came from that .
"we <unk> here in the first line of the <unk> reality , and in the <unk> ."
we have <unk> technologies now through this fast <unk> to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we now have a big opportunity to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
"if you imagine making these 20 million different genes , or trying to make these <unk> to make <unk> or drugs for <unk> new drugs , we can change with just a small team more than the last 20 years ."
"and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> <unk> , production from chemicals or <unk> and so on ."
this is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re working with actually you &apos;re actually sitting in and <unk> new species on computers .
"you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know how their genetic code is going to look like ."
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation .
"they &apos;ve seen corn in <unk> recently , which is just a bad experiment ."
"we have <unk> the <unk> and third generation that are going to be <unk> to have much more <unk> than <unk> , or different ways of <unk> ."
"but , as we think , the only way that biology is a huge impact on the cost of <unk> or <unk> of its own <unk> , when we see co2 as co2 as as we see , and we &apos;re going to go to the cells ."
"and we think we &apos;re going to be the first one of the fourth <unk> generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months ."
sunlight and co2 is a way of that .
"but in our discovery of the world , we &apos;ve all been able to <unk> all kinds of <unk> ."
this is one organism we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
"he lives in the <unk> , about <unk> miles deep , almost <unk> <unk> ."
it <unk> co2 in <unk> to the use of hydrogen as hydrogen as a source .
"we &apos;re looking at whether we can use <unk> co2 , which could be just <unk> , <unk> co2 <unk> the process to make this process ."
"within a short period of time , we think we could be one of the basic questions of life ."
"you know , we have really -- <unk> goals as the <unk> of the entire industry -- exactly if you don &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? you can &apos;t be a <unk> of energy <unk> ."
"but we &apos;re working right now , the same <unk> for <unk> the development of <unk> ."
"you saw it this year with the flu , we &apos;re always a year back , and have a dollar down to a little bit , if it goes to the right vaccine ."
i think that this can be changed by <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
"this is how the future might be able to look like changes , today the <unk> <unk> can be <unk> with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> ."
we &apos;re <unk> to improve people away . we &apos;re just trying to survive a chance to survive enough to do that . thank you very much .
i had a <unk> about the last ted conference .
and i promised to come back to you just explain how the machine works .
"so it &apos;s <unk> . and for all those of them who were not there , the biggest scientific experiment is the ever <unk> experiment that has ever been in <unk> , 27 miles in the <unk> ."
his task is to create the conditions that are less than a <unk> second after the beginning of the universe -- and to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just <unk> <unk> .
this is the machine below <unk> .
we take pictures of these <unk> in <unk> .
"this is what i work . it &apos;s called the <unk> -- 44 meters in the <unk> , 22 feet in the <unk> ."
this is a <unk> image of the actual background in the construction so that it &apos;s <unk> .
"on <unk> <unk> <unk> year , the machine was about the first time ."
and this image was taken from an actual area .
it <unk> <unk> <unk> in the control room .
"it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> that <unk> all the way around the <unk> <unk> , then <unk> the <unk> to take a part of the <unk> to <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> ."
"in other words , when we saw this image at the <unk> of september , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph ."
"i don &apos;t know if this was the largest <unk> <unk> , or this , as someone went to the google side , and the <unk> was so <unk> ."
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific <unk> .
"about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these <unk> here with these <unk> -- that was the golden <unk> here ."
these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine goes on <unk> .
"well , the engineers , you &apos;ll look at them and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t . they &apos;re little <unk> . &quot;"
"you can afford that because if you <unk> them very far , you &apos;ll be <unk> them ."
"so at minus <unk> degrees , <unk> as the space between the stars , these <unk> can <unk> the tension ."
"in one of the connections , between magnets that were <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> ."
and it <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> suddenly <unk> <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
"now , this is all <unk> when you imagine that the magnet <unk> over 20 pounds and <unk> about about 30 inches ."
so we <unk> about 50 of the magnet magnet .
"and they had to remove them , which we had to do ."
"we <unk> them , <unk> them ."
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
"by march march , the <unk> will be <unk> again ."
"we &apos;re going to collect it , and we &apos;ll expect the first data in june or <unk> , and we &apos;ll have our journey to figure out what the building of the universe is ."
"now , of course , in a way , these accidents have <unk> the value of science and science <unk> to the boundaries . it &apos;s easy to <unk> something ."
"i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to <unk> the fact that we &apos;re <unk> beyond our borders , we &apos;re <unk> the value of things like the <unk> ."
"i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words to a english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who , as i suspect , he was the most successful experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> , who said , &quot; no , to what is more dangerous to our <unk> of our <unk> ."
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
"books are my job , but it &apos;s more than that ."
"it &apos;s also my big , <unk> love and <unk> ."
and i don &apos;t expect that the difference will change .
"however , <unk> is a strange thing in my life and my career has happened to me to rethink my own about this work completely ."
"this <unk> event was that i recently wrote a book -- a <unk> called <unk> , <unk> <unk> , love <unk> , my <unk> -- that decided to do different ways of <unk> books from the world of <unk> , a great international international rule ."
"the result is that i don &apos;t know where i come from , i will be treated as if i was the <unk> ."
seriously -- seriously the <unk> .
"for example , come on a worry about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you never get rid of this success ?"
do you don &apos;t fear that you &apos;re making your entire life and you &apos;re never creating a book that <unk> in the world ? never <unk> again ?
"okay , that &apos;s really <unk> ."
"it would be worse when i didn &apos;t remember that i was telling about 20 years ago when i first told them that i was a writer that i wanted to be a writer , with the same kind of <unk> response ."
"people said , &quot; do you have no fear , never to have success ? &quot;"
do you have no fear that you &apos;re <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ?
you don &apos;t worry that you &apos;re going to <unk> your life and you &apos;re never going to get something that you &apos;re never going to die and you &apos;re going to be <unk> on a <unk> of your mouth -- your mouth to be <unk> ?
"so , you know , you know ."
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk> <unk> .
"yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things ."
and i &apos;ve always had .
and i &apos;ve got a lot of things that nobody would do with a lot of <unk> .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
"but , if writing is about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it recently , and i wonder , why ?"
is that <unk> ?
is it <unk> that someone should be expected to fear that he &apos;s done to do the work he feels &quot; <unk> ?
and what &apos;s exactly the creative <unk> that they &apos;re making <unk> about the <unk> of <unk> -- in a way that there are other professions ?
"my father , for example , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , who he was asked to be , he was afraid to be chemist ."
"with your <unk> , john -- how are you going to do ?"
"it just didn &apos;t get before , you know ?"
but to be fair -- the group of chemist have not <unk> people &apos;s <unk> of <unk> people .
"we seem to have a <unk> of <unk> , but not only the writers , but the creative <unk> , seem to have to have this <unk> , <unk> , to be <unk> ."
"all you have to do is look at the <unk> <unk> of really great minds from the 20th century , who died young and often died of their own hand ."
"and even those who were not actually <unk> <unk> , seemed to be really <unk> by their talents ."
norman <unk> <unk> said a short before his death in his last interview : <unk> every one of my books has just killed me a little bit .
a <unk> statement you can do about your <unk> .
"but we don &apos;t even know if we hear somebody like this , because we know this kind of about a long time ago , we &apos;ve got the notion of so <unk> and <unk> <unk> and so on creativity and so on the end of <unk> -- and art -- and the end -- and the end of"
the question i want to ask you today today is this idea for you all right ?
do you feel like that ? because with only a <unk> distance -- i &apos;m not feeling at all .
i think they &apos;re <unk> .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch them taken into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we live our great creative <unk> .
"and i definitely know that it would be -- in my situation -- very dangerous to start to start with this dark path , sort of <unk> -- especially in the fact i &apos;m in my career ."
"that &apos;s called -- you see me , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old ."
i may have more 40 <unk> in me .
"and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world as the work was <unk> , that came to the <unk> success of my last book , right ?"
i say it <unk> because we &apos;re all in a way of a way of friends -- it &apos;s very likely that my <unk> is behind me .
"oh , jesus , what a thought !"
"these are the kinds of thoughts that can bring someone to the <unk> of <unk> at the morning , <unk> , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m not going to do ."
i would rather be doing this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
"after some time of the <unk> , i seem to realize that i must continue to write , a kind of psychological design of psychological design ."
"somehow i have to find a way to write a safe distance between me and , and my very natural <unk> about how the response is to being <unk> ."
"while i was looking for models of models for this , i also looked for in the past , and i tried to find other societies to see how they could be creative or better , for how we could be able to <unk> ideas about how to improve and better ideas ."
and this is what i found in the old <unk> and the old <unk> .
"please follow me , because the circle will close again ."
"but in the old <unk> and <unk> , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?"
"they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> that comes from a distant , <unk> source source to people -- from <unk> , for <unk> reasons ."
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> .
"from <unk> , he said he believed he had a <unk> who <unk> him from further ."
"the <unk> had the same idea , called the <unk> creative mind , a <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
this is great . the <unk> didn &apos;t really think that a <unk> <unk> individual was particularly <unk> .
"they believed that a <unk> was <unk> to the kind of <unk> creature that believed that it lives in the walls of a <unk> -- about the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the artist of the <unk> and the <unk> of the work ."
"this is a brilliant -- there &apos;s this , because that &apos;s the distance i talked about -- the <unk> <unk> who protect you from your work ."
"and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?"
"the artist &apos;s artist &apos;s <unk> was protected things , like , for example , too much , too much ?"
if your work was brilliant you couldn &apos;t look at anything for you . everyone knew that you had this <unk> <unk> that helped you have .
"if your work <unk> -- not entirely your mistake , right ?"
everybody knew your <unk> was a little bit more <unk> .
so people in the west really have thought about creativity about creativity .
"and then the <unk> came and changed , and everything was that we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let us put human individual at the center of the universe -- about all the <unk> and <unk> and there &apos;s no <unk> of the power ."
it &apos;s the beginning of rational <unk> and people started to believe that creativity came from their own individual .
"for the first time in history , people are listening to these people or the artists -- instead of having a <unk> ."
"i have to say , i think it was a big mistake ."
"you know ? i think to give a <unk> person that he thinks he thinks or it &apos;s like the <unk> , like the essence and the source and the source , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> a little bit of <unk> ."
it &apos;s like somebody to ask the sun .
the <unk> and <unk> <unk> all the <unk> and it creates all these <unk> expectations of success .
i think that this <unk> has <unk> our artists that have <unk> over the last 500 years .
"and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- it &apos;s the question ."
can we change it ?
maybe to a more <unk> understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative <unk> .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just <unk> the <unk> from 500 years of <unk> in a <unk> talk .
"and there are certainly people in this audience who would really <unk> scientific doubt about the idea of the idea -- basically -- <unk> , <unk> people and apply to their projects and so on ."
i &apos;m not going to all of you to take a trip to this journey .
but the question i want to ask is : why not ?
why not think about that ?
"because it &apos;s as much as anything else i &apos;ve heard from , when it went to explain the absolutely crazy <unk> of creative process ."
"one process that knows -- like everyone who has ever tried to do something -- in other words , everyone here in other words -- not always , <unk> ."
"in fact , he can <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"i had recently been a <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> american <unk> , who now was over 90 , but her whole life was <unk> for me , and she told me that she was going to be on in the <unk> of virginia ."
she said it would be like a <unk> train from air .
the land on her <unk> .
"she felt like it was coming , because it would bring the earth under her feet to the <unk> ."
"she knew that she could do just one of the time , and that was -- in her words , <unk> like the devil ."
they <unk> like the devil to the house while she was <unk> by this poem . it was the only way they needed enough enough to get a piece of paper and a pen to <unk> it by <unk> it and <unk> it through the sheet .
"at other words , she wasn &apos;t very quickly enough . she <unk> and <unk> , but she didn &apos;t <unk> the house and she <unk> the poem through her , she <unk> , she said she would go over and she said , she <unk> , she <unk> ."
and then there were these moments -- the part i will never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they were almost <unk> .
"so , she <unk> up to the house and she &apos;s looking for paper and she goes through her , she &apos;s just <unk> a pen , and she said , she was -- she was like she , she was going to get her hands and she else ."
"she <unk> the poem on his <unk> , and she <unk> it back into her body and took it on the paper ."
and the opportunities came up with this poem and <unk> <unk> on paper -- but backwards -- the last word for the first .
"and when i heard that , i thought that &apos;s a <unk> thing -- that &apos;s just how my creative process is going to happen ."
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
"i &apos;m a <unk> . i can work , and i have to get up every day , and i &apos;m <unk> , and i &apos;m <unk> to <unk> and really <unk> ."
"but even in my <unk> , i have this thing sometimes <unk> ."
and i guess many of you have done this .
"even , i had been working or ideas that made from a source from <unk> that i can &apos;t really identify ."
what &apos;s this thing for a thing ?
"and how do we deal with that in terms of our minds without losing , but actually <unk> us to <unk> health ?"
"for me , the best living example of how to do this can be <unk> with the <unk> tom <unk> , i <unk> him for a magazine in a magazine ."
"we talked about this issue , and you know what ? most of his life was tom &apos;s embodiment of the embodiment of <unk> of modern <unk> , trying to <unk> this creative <unk> that <unk> into them and with them ."
"but then he got older and <unk> . he told me that he went to a <unk> in los angeles , and it changed everything ."
"he drove at high speed , when he suddenly heard a little <unk> of a <unk> that &apos;s a lot of the way that it &apos;s hard to do it for him , and he wants to <unk> it . he <unk> them , but he can &apos;t <unk> it ."
"he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> ."
"so he starts to get this old <unk> , like , like <unk> , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be <unk> by this song on forever ."
"i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t <unk> it ."
"but instead of getting <unk> , he just stopped ."
he ended up doing the whole <unk> and did something completely new .
"he just <unk> into the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you see that i drive a car ? &quot;"
so i see <unk> from the way i could just <unk> a song ?
"if you really want to exist to come to a <unk> moment , if i can take care of you ."
"if not , <unk> today somebody else ."
go and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
his <unk> <unk> has changed after that .
not the work itself . it was often as dark as <unk> and the same .
"but the process and the difficult <unk> that around it was <unk> when he took the <unk> out , where he didn &apos;t take anything as a <unk> and <unk> it to the point where he knew that it was not a <unk> , no <unk> ."
"it could be a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> thing that wasn &apos;t entirely tom ."
"when i heard this story , it changed a little bit as i worked , and it has taken me back ."
"this idea <unk> me as i was in the middle of <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , i was going to be one of those <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> we &apos;re all going to work when we &apos;re going to do something , and not make it a <unk> ."
"not bad , but the <unk> of all times ."
"i started thinking , i should just <unk> the project ."
"but then i remembered by <unk> in the free sky , and i tried to do it ."
so i &apos;m going to take my view of the <unk> and i was talking about my <unk> in a empty corner of space .
"i talked to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and you know , and i &apos;m both sure that this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not my fault , right ?"
"because you see that i have everything i have , i don &apos;t have anymore ."
"so if you want to have better , you have to <unk> here and share your deal with it ."
okay . but if you don &apos;t <unk> -- you know what the hell you know .
"i &apos;ll still write , because that &apos;s my job ."
and i want to give <unk> that i was here for my part of the jobs here .
"because ... at the end , it &apos;s like <unk> . centuries ago , in <unk> , people have been <unk> with <unk> <unk> and <unk> with <unk> , for hours , <unk> up to <unk> ."
"these <unk> were always great , because the <unk> were professional and they were fantastic ."
"but again and very rare , something remarkable happened in a <unk> , actually <unk> ."
"and i know you know , i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen that you &apos;ve seen in your life ."
"it was when the time was <unk> and the <unk> were <unk> by a kind of <unk> , and he did nothing different than he did before -- a thousand <unk> before , but it had all <unk> together ."
"and suddenly , he didn &apos;t seem to be <unk> anymore ."
"it was <unk> from inside and down from the bottom , and it <unk> all through a <unk> fire ."
"as something that was happening then , people knew what was . they called the name ."
"they put the hands together and started singing : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god ."
"this is god , you know ?"
"interesting historical <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , they took this <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> changed , over centuries of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> ."
"if a <unk> in spain has done something <unk> , something that has done : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> view of god ."
"and that &apos;s great , because we need that ."
"but the <unk> part of the next morning , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> up itself and <unk> that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and it &apos;s no longer <unk> of god <unk> ."
"it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and maybe it will never be <unk> out again to that <unk> ."
"and maybe someone &apos;s never going to call <unk> , <unk> , but what would he do to the rest of his life ?"
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most creative <unk> of a different life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of <unk> if they didn &apos;t believe that the <unk> <unk> of their <unk> is going to come from .
"if you just think that you &apos;re a <unk> -- from a <unk> source of a <unk> source of time for someone else &apos;s life , when you &apos;re done ."
"if we start thinking about this , it changes everything ."
"so i started thinking , and i think i &apos;ve been working with security for the last months , while i was working on the book that &apos;s going to soon as a dangerous , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in my <unk> <unk> ."
"what i &apos;ve got to say is , if i &apos;m crazy about it , i &apos;m not afraid ."
don &apos;t be <unk> .
just make your job .
"is still for your contribution , because he &apos;s whatever he might be ."
"if your job is dancing , dance ."
"if the stupid <unk> <unk> <unk> you to hand , <unk> , for a moment to show a <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> !"
"and if not , dance , they did ."
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you of all of this .
"and i think that and i feel the feeling , we should teach ."
"<unk> <unk> ! for you all of this , just for you , you just have the <unk> human love and the <unk> <unk> for being there ."
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
"last year , i showed these two slides to <unk> that the <unk> <unk> , for three million years , had <unk> to the bottom <unk> of the lower country , to 40 percent ."
"but this is not <unk> enough to the <unk> of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the <unk> of the <unk> ."
"in a sense , the <unk> is the <unk> heart of our global heart ."
it <unk> in winter and <unk> in the winter .
the next slide i show you is a <unk> of what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is <unk> with red .
"as you see , it <unk> down to the <unk> , and this is the <unk> ice in the winter , and it &apos;s <unk> in the summer ."
"the so-called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which <unk> out of the body ."
"in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here to here ."
"this is a problem because warming <unk> the <unk> of the ocean , where there is large amounts of <unk> carbon , which is when it &apos;s going to <unk> <unk> microbes from microbes ."
"compared to the whole amount of <unk> <unk> in the atmosphere , this amount could be double when we cross that critical point ."
"now , <unk> in some flat lakes in alaska is <unk> from the water ."
professor <unk> <unk> in the university of alaska is at another <unk> to a different sea seas that last winter has gone .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is how it <unk> us .
and one reason is that enormous <unk> <unk> <unk> from north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> .
if you want to know how sea level of sea level <unk> you <unk> into the sea .
these rivers are <unk> <unk> .
"on the end of the planet , the antarctica , the biggest <unk> on the planet ."
"last month , researchers <unk> that the entire continent has a negative <unk> ."
and the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> about a few <unk> <unk> is very <unk> .
"this is 20 feet of <unk> , like <unk> ."
"and in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see new lakes , which were <unk> a few years ago ."
40 percent of all people in the world get half of their <unk> from this <unk> .
"in the <unk> , this <unk> is the <unk> for this city ."
the <unk> have <unk> .
"but if you <unk> , the most <unk> is <unk> ."
"in california , an 40 <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of sierra <unk> ."
this is the <unk> .
"and the predictions that you &apos;ve read about , are seriously ."
these <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> <unk> .
"and the <unk> everywhere in the world have actually <unk> in a really <unk> , and never <unk> <unk> ."
<unk> so many in the last 30 years as in the <unk> <unk> .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
"if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it <unk> ."
"in the last five years , we &apos;ve got 70 million tons of co2 from co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day ."
"look at the area of the eastern pacific , from the american continent , both sides of the indian <unk> and both of the indian <unk> , where there is a <unk> of the ocean in the ocean ."
"the biggest factor for global warming , <unk> , <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels ."
"oil is a problem , and coal is the yet biggest problem ."
the united states is one of the two great <unk> together with china .
"and the <unk> was , many other <unk> ."
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones who have been <unk> in the last few years with some green alternatives that have been <unk> .
<unk> is a political <unk> in our country .
"and the <unk> and <unk> have spent an <unk> of <unk> last <unk> to <unk> the clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself ."
this image reminded me about something .
"and the christmas line was , at home at <unk> , a billion tons of <unk> ."
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the <unk> of america .
this happened for christmas .
one of the <unk> of the <unk> was on christmas .
"<unk> of the <unk> is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
"it &apos;s got in the skin and <unk> in america , and it helps our economy to grow ."
"<unk> , the <unk> will get clean every day ."
"he &apos;s <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> remain in <unk> and bread ."
this is the source of coal in west virginia .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of coal .
"let me say one very clear . al gore , nancy <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about ."
so the <unk> for two <unk> has been <unk> .
this is a part of you .
"in the <unk> , we see <unk> <unk> as a serious threat to our business ."
"so we &apos;ve set up this to <unk> , a <unk> <unk> to spend a <unk> on the path to get the truth over coal ."
"the fact is , coal is not dirty ."
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s <unk> well .
"so , don &apos;t worry about the <unk> ."
let &apos;s just give it a <unk> .
"<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it ."
"so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean <unk> ."
fantastic ! this machine is quite <unk> .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean <unk> .
"and yet the <unk> of coal is the <unk> for global warming , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you see here , everything ."
"look at it right , this is the one that &apos;s today , clean <unk> ."
"finally , the positive alternative to our economic challenge with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security ."
"america is in a crisis , the economy , the <unk> security , the <unk> ."
the red <unk> that connects them all together is our <unk> <unk> from <unk> like coal and <unk> of coal .
"but now there &apos;s a <unk> , new solution to <unk> us from that <unk> ."
<unk> america with 100 percent clean electricity within the next 10 years .
"a plan , america to work back to work , to help us safer , to help stop global warming global warming ."
"finally , one solution to solve the big enough to solve our problems ."
<unk> america <unk> . find more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
"one of the fastest ways , our <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> our world ."
"the future is here . wind , sun and a new <unk> ."
new investments to create well jobs in order .
<unk> america is <unk> . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
"there &apos;s an old <unk> <unk> : &quot; if you want to do it fast , just go alone ."
"if you want to get far , go together . &quot;"
"we need to come far , and we have to go fast ."
thank you .
i want to start asking you to start to <unk> at the time of their childhood when they played with <unk> .
"and as they found that they <unk> their hands and <unk> , the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , they actually learned to <unk> and <unk> problems through the understanding of the understanding and <unk> ."
the <unk> thinking is <unk> connected to how we understand a majority of our environment .
"when <unk> -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- with my <unk> and my colleagues <unk> , i started to wonder : what if we could use computers , instead , instead of how to move a <unk> , as a <unk> , and how to <unk> , what could be a <unk> , as"
and this question was so <unk> that we decided to explore in the answer to the answer and we <unk> developed .
"in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> ."
"you can move with your hand , you can see each other , you can detect your movements , and you have a screen screen ."
"more importantly , are physically , why you &apos;re able to <unk> them just by the hands of hands and access to the hands ."
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of go to the process of digital data .
"and when these tools are becoming <unk> and a conscious awareness for their movements , they recognize each other and the <unk> of our <unk> actually , we can start to see them with exploration and <unk> <unk> ."
i start with some simple examples .
"this <unk> is <unk> for the <unk> , and when i put it into a direction , the video will move forward , when i move it in the other direction , it goes backwards ."
and these interactive portraits are <unk> .
"so if i put them on top of them , it makes you interest ."
"if you &apos;re surrounded by <unk> , you &apos;ll notice that , and you can get something nervous ."
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and <unk> .
"and a interesting consequence of the <unk> that we started to see was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like , to <unk> how to do this with <unk> ."
"in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to <unk> color in the middle , where they &apos;re going to <unk> ."
"if we &apos;re <unk> it , we can do a little bit of <unk> ."
"there are also some nice <unk> in education like languages , math or <unk> , where we give people the possibility of fast <unk> and the results immediately want to see ."
here i am -- this is a <unk> i <unk> with a simple <unk> .
"this is a game with <unk> , which is a kind of a mixture of <unk> and <unk> ."
"basically , every round of the <unk> is going to happen to be <unk> letters , and as you try to make words , these are going to be <unk> by a dictionary ."
"then , after about 30 seconds , you get <unk> and you have a new <unk> and you have new possibilities ."
thank you .
"these are some children who came to a <unk> media lab , and i could move it , and put a video in it ."
they really have <unk> it .
"so , one interesting way of using this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions ."
all you have to say is &quot; words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our <unk> <unk> <unk> down there on the right .
it turns out that he just wanted to <unk> the <unk> .
"so for him , they were just <unk> ."
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
that &apos;s <unk> .
"he can bring new characters in the scene by <unk> the <unk> from the table , the character of the table ."
here he <unk> the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he <unk> a <unk> in the scene .
the <unk> <unk> .
good job ! yes !
"by putting the <unk> <unk> , and then it can put the characters together , and he can interact the characters ..."
... his own story .
hello .
it &apos;s a story with <unk> and it can decide how it <unk> .
flying .
"the last example that i have now , for a time , to show it &apos;s a <unk> for <unk> that we &apos;ve been developing recently and <unk> as <unk> <unk> as <unk> as <unk> and <unk> ."
each has four different <unk> ; you can choose which you want to use .
and you can <unk> those <unk> into the sequence that you can put in any pattern .
and you <unk> them by just holding a <unk> on a <unk> .
"there are effects that you can change live , like <unk> and <unk> ."
you connect it with a certain sound and then you put it into the <unk> .
and then <unk> effects like speed and <unk> that you &apos;re using to sequence the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s take a look .
"we start , in which we <unk> the <unk> into two <unk> and this in a series , they expand and add a little more of the voice ."
now i &apos;m going to add a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to do something more interesting now .
and now i &apos;m going to connect the <unk> with the <unk> so i can control the effect .
i can <unk> the whole sequence by <unk> the speed of one or another .
and i &apos;ll just <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> ; a little more expression .
i can <unk> the sequence as it goes through .
"i don &apos;t have to plan them in the <unk> , but it can <unk> them ; they &apos;re <unk> <unk> or <unk> ."
and i can <unk> the whole sequence by the way that i &apos;ve been <unk> .
thank you .
"so , as you can see , my <unk> is to develop new <unk> that make better fit in the way our brains and our bodies work ."
"and today , i had a part of this new <unk> and some of the possibilities that we &apos;re working on in our lab ."
the idea that i &apos;d like to give you a way to the <unk> is that we &apos;re on the <unk> of this new generation of <unk> to interaction with digital media that bring information to our <unk> in the world .
thank you .
i &apos;m very excited to talk to you about all .
"yes , good day ."
"i &apos;m going to be here , i &apos;m here ."
"yes , so what should be <unk> ?"
"i have to do a little bit of <unk> , and that &apos;s a lot of <unk> with modern <unk> ."
"i &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> for a few years now , and i &apos;ve started to know , and i just wanted to know , and i just to do it in <unk> , which i wanted to do as <unk> in science ."
"so , that was my <unk> motivation ."
"so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter , like this ."
"i think that the <unk> in general now , in general , talked about biotechnology , everything that you &apos;re doing is <unk> biology and so on ."
"<unk> important is now extremely important , and yet much , much more important will be in the future ."
there &apos;s so <unk> things like this all the <unk> <unk> that have <unk> plants on the <unk> .
"there &apos;s now craig venter &apos;s craig venter &apos;s <unk> to make <unk> , so <unk> from algae ."
"there are also things that are all <unk> in the daily world , which is not aware of the most people , but , for example , <unk> that allow us to <unk> with <unk> degrees , are also <unk> <unk> ."
and the list can continue to continue .
"and so the interest of this , in this kind of technology , i &apos;m just going on there ."
so what &apos;s <unk> now ?
most people know the most people know it from the <unk> .
"computers <unk> , and it will always break into the media like this , yes , the hacker break somewhere and a <unk> data and so on ."
"so that &apos;s kind of sad for the <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t even get it , which actually <unk> it , and what &apos;s actually going on ."
"and that &apos;s the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , started with <unk> , and it &apos;s also the internet ."
"and it &apos;s about <unk> , creative , creative <unk> , <unk> , to solve a problem ."
"and the problem that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a <unk> problem , it can be easy to be a <unk> , so how things can make things a <unk> , a <unk> , and how can you do it , or how much ."
"and it was <unk> , and it was <unk> with software , but there &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole <unk> that make <unk> all kinds of <unk> of things ."
"and now , just in the direction of biology , and that &apos;s because i want to take out of synthetic biology , take a <unk> , because biology is a <unk> code , it &apos;s not a bit , but it &apos;s not the light , it &apos;s not the same thing , right now , it &apos;s"
"but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also <unk> it , and you can also <unk> it , so , and i found that i found incredibly <unk> , and i just wanted to just go back with <unk> ."
"it &apos;s actually <unk> eight times really <unk> , <unk> these networks ."
"there &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland and with europe and with cooperation in india , but has now active people who have come across the world ."
"and that &apos;s a more artistic <unk> , so there &apos;s a lot of artists , and <unk> , and <unk> with scientists , with <unk> , and asking these technologies and questions and the <unk> , and there &apos;s all kinds of <unk> , and there &apos;s all <unk> ."
"but it &apos;s actually all about to find a <unk> access to a <unk> , so that &apos;s how to have a <unk> of it ."
"and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ."
"this is from the <unk> a network , which is actually a kind of kind of a forum , where you &apos;re going to take care of it and <unk> online ."
"they &apos;re a little of technical <unk> and they &apos;re also a little bit of <unk> , and they &apos;re also going to ask <unk> questions ."
"and <unk> of these <unk> that made the whole <unk> , just evolved to be a scene that i want to <unk> ."
"and in the image here , you see the <unk> on the left , which is a <unk> , so basically a school , a private school , <unk> , <unk> where everyone can get ."
"children , old , all kinds of people go and just <unk> with it , they put a laboratory in the lab and look at what they can do when they <unk> ."
"and there &apos;s a group in indonesia , <unk> <unk> , which is that there are already a very long time ."
longer than these two networks have .
"the <unk> also in such an artistic aspect of <unk> materials and , and also <unk> , and combine that in a very <unk> way ."
"a group of <unk> that i &apos;ve <unk> for a while that &apos;s a <unk> that <unk> to give more to the public what they wanted to learn in the college , and they &apos;ve done so little bit of <unk> and <unk> little people to do so little <unk> ."
and i have a lecture in the other world in the <unk> museum in <unk> at the medical museum in the <unk> of a <unk> .
"and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s the most of the time , that &apos;s the only man , but the only thing that is that all <unk> is all of the <unk> of technology , that &apos;s the most exciting thing ."
"and what you can do with that , and you can also <unk> the society to ask people to ask and ask , so , okay , what you know what <unk> do you &apos;ve done , you &apos;ve got your interest to you about that ?"
"so , <unk> , to <unk> biology , you need to do things ."
"you need to take biological materials , and you need tools , and then , and that &apos;s a lab ."
"<unk> , which you usually understand under a lab , which is so kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely expensive , extremely expensive , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> academics and so on ."
"and our approach was just to say , <unk> , that actually doesn &apos;t have to do that ."
"it &apos;s not really necessary because every single <unk> has actually evolved higher technology than most of the technology that &apos;s really , that &apos;s really the same ."
"and <unk> &apos;s <unk> with this <unk> has tried to do , for example , brian <unk> in england , a <unk> <unk> , then a <unk> , and then <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and then <unk> bacteria ."
"so every one , which is a soup that &apos;s been left for a long time , even before ."
"i tried this in my lab , a little bit of <unk> , and then i took a <unk> on ebay and made a little bit more <unk> analysis , so i &apos;ve tried to take a <unk> <unk> , so on home ."
"now , this should be no joke at all right now , but ."
"and at the bottom here , you see the lab is in <unk> , so a <unk> garage , with such a <unk> <unk> , the <unk> has <unk> , a group in paris , which is also what &apos;s been in a pretty good job in it ."
"and this is <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> , that , that &apos;s what kind of <unk> , basically , is a kind of <unk> of biology ."
"and so , you see , it &apos;s relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s a <unk> of people who are going to take care of home to the big bigger organizations that are on ."
but the idea is always that the approach that it &apos;s just going to be easy and available .
"so the first project we &apos;ve done as an international group , as we &apos;ve been <unk> of our own , <unk> , we &apos;ve now got here as real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re so excited about the people , and so on ."
"and then the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , who said , and said , &quot; well , we really have to meet a real meeting , and then two <unk> , a <unk> , in london , and a half in the <unk> , and a half in a short , <unk> , and a <unk>"
"and then , there &apos;s also , you know , <unk> , who are we , what do we want to do what we want to do ?"
"and what are our values and what are our <unk> , what are our foundation ?"
and then we have a <unk> <unk> .
"so , that was right , intuitive , so everyone has just got his wishes , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to move on , and then , as it goes ."
"there was a good code , in my mind , a very good code ."
"and we &apos;ve not <unk> that , but that &apos;s just , i think , i think , has a pretty good <unk> people are here right there ."
"and we even tried to <unk> that into the <unk> world , but it &apos;s kind of not that <unk> ."
"so i think we &apos;re from the <unk> , in the sense , even step further than the <unk> world ."
"yes , what projects do we actually do so ?"
"a project that i did with the <unk> in switzerland from myself , was we wanted to do a so-called <unk> event or <unk> <unk> ."
"so , if you &apos;re focused on a <unk> , in the room , then you can <unk> these little particles into the air or in that liquid and then , in this focus , which is basically a <unk> like a <unk> ."
"this works really , that &apos;s going to be done in <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ve thought , <unk> , we might have <unk> , and then we &apos;ve taken a <unk> , the <unk> lens , the <unk> lens , and you have a microscope ."
this is what you see down there .
"and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the laser , and then we tried to focus on this camera ."
"and unfortunately , it &apos;s not working , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of the time ."
"so another project , from the french group there , out of paris , that &apos;s pretty cool ."
"and that &apos;s what he &apos;s like to do so that he &apos;s got a <unk> , so <unk> , or something , so he &apos;s got <unk> , is his <unk> <unk> ."
"he then <unk> this helmet to the helmet , and in cooperation with the museum , the museum had gone ."
"there were the <unk> in the room , and there was the <unk> <unk> , put them on this chair ."
"then they were measured their <unk> , and the one after they thought or how they thought they were , then different lights of the room ."
it was quite a pretty <unk> project .
"another thing from the u.s. that also has to do with this <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> , complicated , complicated word ."
"so it &apos;s about <unk> genes , using gene , <unk> , <unk> , so you can see it ."
"so if i do this , the <unk> of the <unk> , then go back , collect <unk> <unk> , and then they do this method , then they can tell , and then they can tell <unk> , <unk> , to this hair ."
"and the machines that make something like this , which are pretty expensive to buy commercial , the <unk> go up so much , go on the way ."
"and that &apos;s not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do very much ."
"so this is just one application of many , you can do it ."
"and they have two <unk> <unk> , and they said , &quot; well , we do it easier and easier , and then we have <unk> from <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and they have this device and the device that &apos;s actually <unk> ."
i think somehow <unk> dollars or something like that .
"but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s still in any case , where it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s going to be <unk> ."
"so , i think it &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> ."
a project i started building was a <unk> .
"<unk> is , yes , like a kind of <unk> that &apos;s <unk> , that &apos;s about two , two inches or two ."
"you <unk> <unk> and then <unk> into those <unk> , and then you put it into the <unk> , and then i &apos;ve taken them <unk> and then put it up to <unk> and then <unk> it ."
"so the device you see , it doesn &apos;t work ."
"but that &apos;s my <unk> that &apos;s so my <unk> , but it &apos;s pretty <unk> looked like this , so on a <unk> , it was <unk> , and pressure , and it was pressure to be <unk> ."
and then i took a <unk> and i put it on it .
"a <unk> , if you have the full power of water , the enough , i think , so i think , <unk> to the <unk> ."
"and so you can <unk> the particles strong enough , and then you can go into the <unk> ."
"and the commercial device costs about <unk> <unk> up or something like that , <unk> the <unk> ."
"so , it didn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s just <unk> ."
"so , the moment in the scene is the <unk> of the scene , that this availability of technology and also increase the information and the information , that the <unk> can be involved more people ."
"because , as i said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively much of it and also don &apos;t have a chance to make it good ."
"because , if you just read about it , from <unk> , that &apos;s not the same way you &apos;ve done it or you &apos;ve seen it ."
and i think technology is always going to be more important in our modern societies .
"and if you can also make <unk> citizens in society as a community to make decisions and drive , you need to be able to <unk> access and to the technology ."
and you have to do it and understand to understand it and can understand it .
and then the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
"so you &apos;re going to get into the citizens , just to get into these scientific technologies ."
and this is the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
"these are the people who are at least officially <unk> on <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
this is already a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
"and also , what &apos;s interesting is that you &apos;re also <unk> ."
that &apos;s me that i think there &apos;s less people <unk> than actually exist .
so i know from some who don &apos;t have <unk> .
"and these are just the <unk> , the individual people ."
"and in part of these <unk> , so these places are <unk> together ."
and that &apos;s very beginning .
"as i said , <unk> has just started ."
"and <unk> , the <unk> , because the <unk> <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> ."
"and this is now a <unk> network of very good , yes , <unk> , which have become <unk> that are all over the world ."
"and we hope that we will , and then , as well as we get <unk> and then , as much as we have , as well , people will be involved in this way ."
and i would invite everybody to deal with it and even even do what <unk> do .
"now it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , not if you have enough curiosity and enough <unk> , you get there too far ."
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
"yes , <unk> ."
how do we actually work people ?
"this is a question that &apos;s very moving me into the <unk> , but also in the field of <unk> <unk> and all sorts of things in the <unk> ."
it &apos;s about how you can <unk> people into interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and create them an <unk> experience .
"and i think that the interactive media in us have <unk> cognitive models , so <unk> , paradigm , that <unk> in our <unk> memory has been very , very long time , and we can just create the interactive media ."
"and that &apos;s very amazing , because you actually believe that this <unk> you &apos;re <unk> to make you actually get one in the future , but actually it &apos;s the future that the future is really the future of our roots ."
what are they actually <unk> models ?
i &apos;ve just <unk> out four <unk> and i want to explain that .
to <unk> cognitive models and that &apos;s the models that we have in the <unk> times .
to these <unk> models that we have basically <unk> relationship to the between .
this sounds like <unk> <unk> .
"i &apos;m going to take you the same thing , and i &apos;ll give you some point to prove that you have an <unk> relationship to you ."
"the second aspect is that we have been able to do so well since this <unk> models are very , very , very <unk> , even though we use a <unk> language ."
"and the third area , which explains actually itself ."
"we all know that the interactive media are by definition of definition <unk> , which is what the <unk> of the <unk> , and of course , of course , that we &apos;re saying that the <unk> are as normal today ."
the fourth is that the story is a place for us is the <unk> .
"now , this is with the middle of the zone , which is actually the most <unk> thing in the world ."
i want to show you the time .
how many doors has the house in which you live ?
"this will not be able to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen and just happening right now ."
"they go through the <unk> of this house , in <unk> , and look at how many doors are there ."
and that &apos;s what they do .
"they <unk> the reality , and they &apos;re all very long ."
"fantastic , right ?"
"and we &apos;re doing this , for example , the virtual reality in our <unk> , in which we can actually <unk> this all the time ."
"and this wealth <unk> the virtual reality that people have had <unk> in the <unk> times too much time , because they didn &apos;t have anything ."
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have <unk> .
the only thing that had was your head .
"and in that head , the memory was <unk> ."
"in this head , <unk> <unk> and using this virtual images , <unk> , had been passed on ."
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with the between .
"the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip ."
"yes , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on ."
"the interesting thing is that at that time , human being <unk> and medium was ."
"now , if you &apos;re a bit more thinking ."
what are media ?
and then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;ll talk to you about that .
<unk> &apos;s tools that have been always been always known for stories .
"<unk> <unk> , <unk> , called <unk> , were <unk> to keep in stories ."
"and we &apos;re still very , very strong about stories today ."
"the author of the book <unk> , jonathan <unk> , <unk> <unk> , we still <unk> <unk> hours of <unk> stories with the <unk> of stories ."
that means for a child who has spent the most of the <unk> of the most of life with the most of the <unk> of stories .
now we think our love to be about stories that we were sitting on the lap of our parents .
"no , no , far <unk> ."
"that &apos;s a lot more back , in the cultures of the <unk> times ."
"but for me , in the <unk> of the interactive media as an incredibly amazing thing , that we have <unk> in our <unk> <unk> <unk> in our <unk> <unk> , the ability to think about <unk> ."
i brought you a example of a <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the lives in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
"and as you can see , it &apos;s a very <unk> area , and you had to sort of get <unk> from island to come to <unk> food ."
and they did this with something called <unk> .
"you may know that , even if you &apos;re interested in the <unk> , the <unk> ."
they have similar principles .
"they don &apos;t have <unk> , but they have used the <unk> <unk> or <unk> ."
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the <unk> and the <unk> of regions were able to get <unk> to songs .
and the language of <unk> <unk> was <unk> .
that means you &apos;re going to have <unk> over <unk> and rhythm .
"and this <unk> and this rhythm have <unk> , the <unk> of a region , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to do with these songs , and it could be <unk> to <unk> and <unk> , and so on the left back to the <unk> back ."
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from a to b ?
"anyway , not to <unk> ."
what &apos;s actually going on ?
this is what happens to the <unk> age .
we &apos;ve moved to the so-called <unk> .
"this is what &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s what &apos;s happening ."
and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening is that we have the responsibility for our <unk> and the own production of our individual <unk> <unk> <unk> in external media .
and the book and the picture .
so we have a <unk> <unk> to <unk> a <unk> .
"rio is suddenly <unk> to us , and has nothing to do with reality ."
"bruce <unk> , a famous <unk> of <unk> , went to say that this <unk> , he &apos;s the book and the picture , so not the tv , the internet , the internet and so on , what we call our <unk> , our <unk> , as a <unk> ."
let &apos;s do a little <unk> .
the <unk> for the machine .
what does <unk> have our thinking and our <unk> ?
then the <unk> <unk> of <unk> cultures are <unk> .
and they &apos;re going to be more in over centuries and more <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
"that means that instead of <unk> us to have a <unk> , we have a lot of <unk> , far more <unk> pattern of <unk> that we can <unk> our personal <unk> ."
we don &apos;t produce ourselves anymore .
we have a <unk> language .
"we don &apos;t imagine the thing that we don &apos;t have in pictures of things anymore , but we <unk> them ."
we &apos;ve used to think that things are <unk> .
"and we &apos;ve got the <unk> as law , and there are only exceptions , like <unk> <unk> ."
what &apos;s left with us is the <unk> .
"we &apos;re still <unk> to the <unk> as a very , very <unk> ."
"the question is , what is coming now ?"
"we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the age , and we now had the <unk> <unk> ."
"it &apos;s very <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s very <unk> to <unk> , i know ."
but these concepts of the <unk> that bring us to these possibilities back again .
"it &apos;s about monterey . it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> ."
i want to explain a little bit about that .
"there are <unk> concepts like the <unk> <unk> , which means the extended reality ."
"so if you look at google <unk> , for example , then it &apos;s such a concept that <unk> the virtual world with the real world , which is called our <unk> to the <unk> , the virtual , the virtual virtual , <unk> , to <unk> the ordinary ."
another example is the <unk> virtual reality .
"so , of course , it sounds like my <unk> , because we &apos;re physically moving into the existing , virtual worlds , very , very much after the model of the <unk> ."
"and another example is the <unk> , smart systems ."
these are spaces that can respond to a people .
all that needs the ability to accept and really understand ; democracies as a real habitat habitat .
"i &apos;ve got a point in the conclusion , and i hope that video works , a very , very , very beautiful project , that &apos;s the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ."
and the two <unk> are here today .
"maybe you can get up a little bit , so you can get in the <unk> with the two of the project ."
"and this project i brought together as an example , as again , with this <unk> , cognitive models will be <unk> ."
"all of this is a game , i have to say to it ."
"and of course , the <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> ."
"and when i say <unk> , you have very likely to see that <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or that they play with some <unk> in the hand ."
"anyway , they do that in the case ."
this is a game for out .
"and that &apos;s <unk> to think that i <unk> the outside world , so i <unk> the real world ."
"and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce is that we produce with the real world ."
i <unk> to myself that i have to <unk> so much .
"you can explain that much better , because there &apos;s more of them behind ."
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do is to <unk> a city by looking at the places that are positive or negative .
"and so i &apos;m <unk> from the city of a very different view , a very different impression , which i see negative and positive structure , and <unk> in this kind of , a very different map of a very real map of a real city ."
and we can <unk> that up to a <unk> .
"ah , what you can see here , sorry , i &apos;m still a little bit of what you &apos;re seeing ."
"of course , this virtual world in the walls of our cities , it &apos;s clear ."
"and with a kind of <unk> , we can make these virtual worlds ."
"so i &apos;d like to <unk> my <unk> and <unk> my <unk> into the senses and the qualities that we &apos;ve been <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> that we &apos;ve gone on a little bit of <unk> , as the company , the way we call ."
thank you .
"yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be very <unk> to you ."
"i &apos;ve been asked to say , &quot; well , this <unk> is a <unk> <unk> , and my rather than speaking . &quot;"
it won &apos;t do it .
i &apos;ll also <unk> whatever is in there .
but i &apos;ve just just been curious about n .
"yes , children are from nature from curious or <unk> , as well ."
"i &apos;ve been <unk> from your house , so i &apos;m also <unk> myself with the subject of curiosity and how the curiosity is changing , and why we need to lose curiosity and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> and so on ."
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re going to do next to a <unk> .
"when <unk> are becoming curious , they &apos;re often <unk> in the n of <unk> ."
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve had the last half year .
a <unk> for the issue of <unk> <unk> interface interface .
"now you &apos;re going to ask questions about why the whole <unk> of the natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interaction <unk> and <unk> and so on ."
"and there &apos;s one of these little devices that i &apos;m just getting up because things are going to be more intuitive , more <unk> , and more <unk> , which is , you have to look for what is , of course , or intuitive , or intuitive ."
"and before the background , i &apos;ve been in the <unk> <unk> <unk> interface , so the next generation of the human computer in the <unk> , in the <unk> computer , so we &apos;re <unk> to how our tools is changing , our computer <unk> to the digital computer ."
"so i &apos;m busy doing this when of course , of course , is what or intuitive ."
"maybe again , you have to look at a look at that ."
why does this happen at all ?
"so if we look at our society at a short time , this is what we &apos;re moving now , from the third <unk> or <unk> ."
so from the modern <unk> .
every society is <unk> by a <unk> .
"at the beginning , the <unk> <unk> through the language ."
"and that means that you &apos;ve found a common language , and you &apos;ve talked about , you could communicate with each other , or you &apos;ve <unk> in the same cave , cities , or <unk> , and so <unk> , <unk> ."
"the <unk> was the language , something very <unk> , something very <unk> ."
"you had to learn , so no <unk> can be <unk> by nature , but we &apos;re learning it and <unk> , of course , of course ."
and that &apos;s been <unk> by the <unk> society and the first form of <unk> .
"and that was a <unk> , because of course , the living language started <unk> in the form of <unk> , which is what <unk> and alive , i start <unk> and <unk> it into stone and so i was <unk> it ."
"the <unk> as i go and when i go to , of course , it &apos;s a very different <unk> when there &apos;s a alive , of course ."
"but then <unk> then <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
"and then the next generation , where we actually live with <unk> ."
this is just the pressure with the pressure and print <unk> with <unk> and other .
"and then , at the time , it was just a <unk> where <unk> , <unk> , and others said , you know , you &apos;re actually <unk> to read when the people started to read , and that &apos;s , of course , the <unk> , really , right ?"
"and now we &apos;re going to the next generation and the <unk> generation is , just a <unk> , just a few years and we &apos;re really in this moment , in this <unk> phase that we &apos;re in this <unk> ."
"and of course , that &apos;s <unk> us , because we &apos;re looking at the one side of the new media , <unk> social media , facebook <unk> and <unk> ."
"with the <unk> transparency , which is the new thinking about what the old thinking , <unk> , is not that in the <unk> and no longer <unk> , is a <unk> or other <unk> , i want to <unk> the <unk> and <unk> ."
"and these two worlds just <unk> together , new and old thinking ."
"the <unk> thing is , if you <unk> the <unk> , this new society , this <unk> , <unk> a lot of <unk> principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> ."
"but not anymore , but it &apos;s on global level ."
we &apos;ve understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of the global ecology is a global issue .
"not , if i think there &apos;s local <unk> and the <unk> thinks less <unk> , it doesn &apos;t work ."
"that means from local village , is actually a global village , and it has become the same principles , of course , as far as the <unk> transparency ."
"as you knew in the village , who has to do what with and when , this is what happens today , these <unk> of our own <unk> of our <unk> level of global level on global ."
"it &apos;s that we have to know global and <unk> and better , and better ."
"so , as it used to be <unk> to the village ."
"so , in front of the background , i &apos;ve been <unk> to <unk> , which is , because actually , what is we &apos;ve also done for ourselves , what is the <unk> of us , but also , what does the difference ?"
"because they often get people , they can &apos;t make <unk> so that everybody can <unk> it ."
"so you have to do it , which is , because it &apos;s not just changing it , not just that it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s supposed to be better ."
"and when i &apos;m also so intuitive , and as i can take a sense of influence and then <unk> the things like this , which is a <unk> , so that they &apos;re so intuitive , because they &apos;re just doing fun and they &apos;re just doing fun ."
"you go into it , you know , also in the <unk> , with the subject of perception and the <unk> ."
"and that &apos;s also what you start looking at and looked and looked like , okay , i just look inside the inner itself ."
"and what is it like , right ?"
so how do we work when we &apos;re going to work ?
"and what does , of course , is , what is that , really , and how do our <unk> of perception and how does cognitive <unk> ?"
because steve jobs did have told you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
"so you really have to look at the detail , if i want to do something <unk> or intuitive , which is what the core is in the core ."
"and you can see that you have a <unk> of our seven senses , most of us think we &apos;ve got five , now , are even seven <unk> , and certainly in the near future , <unk> , <unk> , and even more than even more ."
"and what do we look at information , how do we take information ?"
"in your own hand , what is information ?"
"information is all difference , which is a difference ."
"many use the word , but don &apos;t even know what it means to make detail ."
"but i have to understand in the core understanding , when it &apos;s going to be information , when information is going to be information , and from information , again , i know how to do things as well as i can do things , of <unk> ."
"and of course , as design <unk> to perception ."
"we see this , if i <unk> things , i can <unk> them like on the right side of where i don &apos;t know what salt and <unk> , or i can <unk> them by <unk> things ."
"so much natural , in a <unk> , but i kind of see right where salt and salt ."
"and if i say somebody , give me salt or <unk> , then <unk> up on the right <unk> , where it &apos;s in ."
"and in the left simply <unk> intuitive , and hopefully that there &apos;s not sugar in there that there is no salt <unk> ."
"but also our perception of itself , as you can , you <unk> it ."
"for example , this perception in context ."
"the right circle looks bigger than the little , even though that &apos;s not the case , they &apos;re just too big , but yet , our perception is changing , depending on what context we &apos;re doing ."
do you know what that is ?
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> should work .
there &apos;s actually more to my <unk> .
so it &apos;s n .
a second circle already starts to <unk> some <unk> or <unk> .
"and if i go to a <unk> , then we don &apos;t even see a <unk> , which is a circle , and yet , we see a <unk> , we see a <unk> , we don &apos;t see three , a circle , a circle , a different circle ."
they call them <unk> or <unk> <unk> that <unk> us in the sense of perception .
"the important thing for the <unk> that have most of the <unk> , the great <unk> ."
"<unk> near the <unk> , the <unk> and so on ."
"often in third , they forget ."
"but that &apos;s an essential part , if you want to do things too much as well as you &apos;re doing ."
"the next phenomenon , which is very interesting , of seeing ."
"sounds very <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> , so that you &apos;re starting to do it ."
"so we have the eyes on the front , and now we think we &apos;re looking at the back ."
that &apos;s wrong .
you see <unk> from the back to the back .
"and they <unk> a <unk> for the front of the <unk> that they see something that they <unk> , <unk> circle ."
"that means that we &apos;re only seeing our <unk> before we see it , again , <unk> back in our <unk> to say , okay ."
"i &apos;ve got this <unk> cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what you want to see ."
"and that &apos;s there , that &apos;s going to come back again ."
"and then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &apos;t go back and say , well , now <unk> , please , if you look , what you see is , you see what you want to see ."
and then it goes back back and then it &apos;s actually going to be seen .
"so a very , very <unk> process , like certain things are going to happen and what happens for the things that happen ."
i don &apos;t know who you know who &apos;s a picture .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve described .
now everybody &apos;s trying to see a pattern from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who <unk> what you see .
does somebody see something <unk> ?
"a <unk> , right ."
"so , if i saw this , that &apos;s a <unk> in there , you know , you know ."
"they &apos;re never going to forget about it , because i &apos;ll show you where the <unk> is ."
now you see the <unk> .
"and , now , look at it all ."
"that means i actually <unk> them in <unk> that they don &apos;t see any pattern of <unk> , but i &apos;ve <unk> them in <unk> in the <unk> , and again , to see this dog in this <unk> picture ."
"and that &apos;s this <unk> of view , of <unk> , ."
"now i know it , and now i &apos;m <unk> to the front that i see the <unk> ."
i see the <unk> .
"so , very , very <unk> <unk> , which then , in this , yes , gray is actually not , but here &apos;s just the <unk> of the mass of this mass ."
anybody know what three seconds are ?
"for long , yes ."
that &apos;s our present present .
"so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers ."
"if i know three seconds , one , until i kind of <unk> into the present , i can also <unk> very well <unk> , in which i &apos;m always <unk> to someone at me with three seconds ."
it has to be <unk> as present .
"then it <unk> into the past , and so i can <unk> very elegant for example of the computer , if i know this phenomenon ."
what does <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
"yes , <unk> ."
"also , a very <unk> phenomenon ."
this is the time you &apos;re in love .
"that means <unk> , if you know what this is , you &apos;re looking at , you &apos;re looking at how long , because i &apos;m not going to be able to do something that &apos;s going to happen in the same way that &apos;s happening ."
"and <unk> <unk> , also a very <unk> phenomenon ."
that &apos;s the most <unk> we have .
that means that this first impression happened in a fast speed of how we perceive things .
and as we see things that we &apos;re seeing and how we &apos;re sort of looking at ourselves against our environment so that we can <unk> the <unk> .
"of course , the <unk> are not only <unk> about the <unk> and <unk> or <unk> , but of course , with the subject of <unk> ."
"so , like a human being , with some things that &apos;s going to be <unk> ."
"so there &apos;s a <unk> that is the <unk> functions , so the regions of the villages or <unk> ."
"there are <unk> , where i know exactly where i actually have to reach ."
"but there &apos;s also <unk> functions , why do anybody have such a little <unk> , where <unk> <unk> anyway , so <unk> <unk> to money , even though it &apos;s not so virtually that ?"
"there &apos;s more on the <unk> , on the <unk> , where we &apos;re <unk> to , of course , as a <unk> ."
"back to my actual topic of <unk> interface , <unk> , and the subject of course , which is also <unk> , <unk> ."
"<unk> means how i can achieve a very quickly , or how can a certain <unk> in a certain way , <unk> in a certain way , <unk> , to reach a goal ."
so it &apos;s more the norm that &apos;s the norm .
how can i do something <unk> ?
i can use this directly or i can <unk> &apos; <unk> or i need <unk> training .
and less <unk> or less <unk> is it .
"i mean that i &apos;m doing this just <unk> and beautiful , not that it &apos;s better ."
you have to understand that .
"and then , if you &apos;re part of the software that we &apos;ve seen , look at , it &apos;s also going to understand why <unk> percent of our software is not <unk> or <unk> <unk> , is in <unk> in software , even as many areas , even as <unk> , whereas <unk> , including <unk> , even"
"and the <unk> <unk> is not only since apple <unk> a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , if i want to make technological technology <unk> ."
why ?
"because in fact , by the way , we &apos;re <unk> through these new kinds of <unk> , the natural <unk> , for example , are five times faster on our goal ."
"you have to imagine that if you &apos;re going to do something of the classic <unk> , five hours and with this new kind of <unk> of software just an hour ."
"that doesn &apos;t mean that they can probably go home for four hours , but you can see their company , or <unk> , you know , as they &apos;re <unk> with the four hours ."
"but i want to say that it &apos;s a <unk> increase for us , also to have certain things ."
"if we put it back into the software , this is the first <unk> <unk> interface , which were very abstract , which is that it took months to do with these systems ."
"and then the next , which is already <unk> , <unk> model , or <unk> model like the software , has worked , which is you have a notion of something that metaphor is a metaphor to make the computer <unk> ."
"so not more <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> , but it &apos;s a metaphor ."
"it made a lot of <unk> , but of course , it &apos;s also much better ."
the next generation of <unk> works already has a lot more with behavior .
"so i &apos;m <unk> as a lot more , more <unk> , as the behavior of it looks like ."
that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
"and i &apos;m going to look at that on a <unk> of <unk> , just the <unk> will be a <unk> ."
"and if i go one step in these <unk> <unk> <unk> , where i <unk> by the language , by the language , by <unk> , by gesture and <unk> , the <unk> things must <unk> and do it , and i still go and <unk> and <unk> ."
"but that leads me again to the point , when things are actually more intuitive ?"
"so if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to <unk> my little friend and look at what that means , because in the <unk> , when is it really , really , too , too , too intuitive ?"
"and that &apos;s something that &apos;s always intuitive for us to think , if i have to think about it much ."
"so he doesn &apos;t like to think about , but it just <unk> out ."
"the less i think about it , the more intuitive , the more it is ."
and what does that mean for the designers ?
"that means , if we look at a <unk> that we can <unk> from one to another , for example , i can use it as a metaphor as a <unk> ."
"that means i can just <unk> a <unk> , human <unk> to software software and make the software a lot more <unk> ."
"and of course , the question is , what is that actually the <unk> of people , actually <unk> us from us and now i &apos;m <unk> ."
this is called the <unk> <unk> .
"that &apos;s what everybody &apos;s <unk> and <unk> is an acronym and it &apos;s <unk> for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ."
"that &apos;s what everybody does all the time , but he &apos;s doing it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s sort of , sort of , intuitive or partly <unk> ."
"the model is already <unk> in the womb and it &apos;s <unk> , so it works at the world of young and old , and it &apos;s going to be used to be used all the time without us to know that this model is there ."
"<unk> <unk> is about <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> of us ever in activity , so in sleep , you &apos;ve noticed that it &apos;s often <unk> less <unk> than the day ."
"i can <unk> this mental <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
"and by the kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the <unk> , but not now a metaphor of a metaphor of a metaphor , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> ."
"and this is at a higher holy grail than the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> metaphor , which is the <unk> ."
"and if i &apos;m <unk> that , for example , in which i <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the case , it comes up to me , i can take it to somebody &apos;s <unk> , or something , <unk> , <unk> , and i can &apos;t <unk> it , or i can"
then i can <unk> all the way .
i &apos;m trying to do this by a <unk> .
you &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> .
"<unk> : now , i &apos;m going to <unk> with the object , can <unk> back again ."
"i &apos;m going to <unk> the whole <unk> , now <unk> <unk> and can tell me just the thing that i can show you for <unk> ."
"and once , a interface interface , which is so far more intuitive , and much more natural ."
"because i can reach out the things like the bits can be <unk> , and come to me , and come to me , is much more natural than about organized websites or other than can make these things to make things available ."
"<unk> is more <unk> <unk> , and i want to close with that sentence , and again , a and a <unk> must think differently , in order to come to new solutions , and thank you very much for you ."
i want to show you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
"the first thing as a child is becoming big , as a baby , is that you &apos;re going to care about what <unk> you have , right ? and the one that your parents have allowed to allow you to do more , or less , your <unk> , and the first , and the <unk> , and"
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn to learn .
"so all of those who are here and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn ."
"i &apos;m going to do it now , basically this whole whole <unk> , <unk> , <unk> years , in the quality of it ."
and there &apos;s a <unk> point in it .
and the phosphorus is on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> : a chance .
"every day they give <unk> <unk> , they give about two <unk> phosphorus , and every day they have to <unk> a <unk> phosphorus ."
you can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t <unk> energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could just <unk> as <unk> as the <unk> .
if we actually don &apos;t take phosphorus and give it .
"and so , it &apos;s <unk> that we &apos;re thinking about something that is actually a <unk> thing , but it &apos;s not that way ."
"because all of the issues about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the <unk> ."
the <unk> is much <unk> .
we &apos;re on two countries .
"we &apos;ve only done for two years , and now we &apos;ve been <unk> by the <unk> world a lot more of uranium in the environment than all <unk> ."
"in the last 20 years , <unk> <unk> tons of uranium in germany had been distributed in germany ."
and we take that all .
it &apos;s <unk> in kids .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less <unk> .
"so , for example , the environment , the environment , <unk> less car ."
"<unk> the environment , <unk> less waste ."
"<unk> the environment , a thousand energy ."
but that &apos;s not protection .
"that &apos;s how if i would say , <unk> your child , it just <unk> five times five times more than it ."
this is just a little less destruction .
"if we think about the <unk> from the <unk> to the <unk> , our entire earth is used to be a <unk> ."
that &apos;s why the <unk> <unk> to think .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as <unk> .
the bottom is <unk> percent of the <unk> .
"right now , we &apos;re building corn down to the <unk> and lose 30 <unk> per <unk> per <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> in the square meter ."
that means we &apos;re losing about more than <unk> .
"we can , of course , <unk> the <unk> ."
and all of it is <unk> or content .
"for example , in <unk> , 20 percent of the <unk> are now <unk> <unk> to <unk> ."
"and as we get older , the <unk> will be bigger ."
"this is , they &apos;re all in the <unk> ."
yes ?
a baby needs about <unk> <unk> <unk> .
"we could reduce that by the age of 10 percent , but what does that ?"
this will be in a second <unk> in china .
that &apos;s completely <unk> .
"so the question is , how do we have this <unk> to do this ?"
here &apos;s one of the proof that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is <unk> with the <unk> <unk> .
people over the <unk> .
yes .
so that can &apos;t be pigs .
"because that &apos;s <unk> , right ?"
"we &apos;re traditionally thinking in the <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world ."
"and if you put people out there , if you think about the people , if you say , that would be better , you don &apos;t have to be there , you &apos;re going to be <unk> and <unk> ."
"and so someone says how <unk> gore , one of our big heroes , there are nothing <unk> than human population to <unk> ."
"in israel , if you &apos;re <unk> a human , you &apos;re <unk> the earth ."
"here &apos;s what it says , the more you <unk> , the better ."
yes .
"the first question is , are we really too many ?"
"if you look at the ants , the ants on earth , then they weigh the ants about <unk> more than we humans ."
"i could also <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the united states , no one might be <unk> in the way , even though they were <unk> ."
that means that ants weigh a lot more than we do .
"and because they work much harder than we work , and they live only only three to six months , they &apos;re <unk> in their energy consumption , in the energy consumption of something like a <unk> billion people ."
"that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?"
"and where you see how far away we were , what we wanted to do and how we could do , and how <unk> we &apos;re on earth are on earth , you can see that you can see that there &apos;s a <unk> program , <unk> , to 20 ."
"you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?"
the only chance .
do you &apos;ve seen a <unk> tree ?
yes ?
one single ?
"that means that our whole intelligence means that we want to be more <unk> than trees , yes ?"
yeah ?
no tree is <unk> .
"<unk> , right ?"
there &apos;s no <unk> at trees .
there are still <unk> billion trees in the <unk> .
you &apos;ve heard about something from <unk> trees ?
that means that all of our intelligence means that we want to be more <unk> than trees .
"and you see , even in a way of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s no way that our own <unk> will go back ."
"every year , we lose so three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back into the <unk> ."
and we &apos;re too many .
just about that .
"that means that we feel so <unk> on earth that we say that there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and how they all have all the <unk> that allow our own <unk> ."
isn &apos;t that sad ?
that we are too many .
it &apos;s safe to be much more <unk> in terms of <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
"we &apos;re trying to <unk> our <unk> footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that &apos;s useful ."
"we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s the highest , not there ?"
"<unk> , yes ?"
you can only have <unk> when you &apos;re not there .
"even if you were to <unk> , you would have emissions ."
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can <unk> our <unk> back .
we &apos;re going to do in brazil in the way we <unk> the <unk> .
we can <unk> in this way that we can <unk> <unk> in agriculture .
"we &apos;re doing this in china for example , where we &apos;re going to take the <unk> of it ."
"in china , a <unk> is still a <unk> <unk> , so , what ?"
"and in our <unk> world we were always too stupid , our <unk> <unk> ."
"that means all western <unk> are <unk> by <unk> the city of <unk> , but the farmers never have something <unk> ."
"and the <unk> had to grow cities more , because the farmers in the cities and the cities had to go further away from their <unk> ."
"and that &apos;s all the <unk> rich are always <unk> until they &apos;ve done the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re <unk> ."
yes ?
china was different .
"you &apos;ve done <unk> civilization over <unk> years , because you &apos;ve always been able to make the <unk> ."
"even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat , in china , you would expect that they stay as long as they stay until they &apos;re <unk> the toilet ."
because it &apos;s <unk> to go and to the <unk> <unk> .
"you &apos;ve got them to eat them , not to <unk> ."
"that means you can see on the internet , as you can get the <unk> back ."
"the real thing about this is , if you do it , agriculture is doing agriculture , <unk> , <unk> on a <unk> of land , can make a <unk> <unk> for about <unk> dollars and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> ."
and the great thing about this is that the <unk> in the <unk> around over <unk> percent of the <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to control people to be very little .
"we can support them , to be good ."
"that &apos;s , of course , <unk> , but the plants are carrying themselves ."
the <unk> is clean water .
and they &apos;re so designed by the design that just can <unk> you .
that means that the <unk> go back .
"and not from those facilities , we &apos;ve been building <unk> in the last 20 years , not ever been <unk> by these facilities ."
you could just <unk> a <unk> of <unk> and then the <unk> would be <unk> over years .
not that happens instead .
"that means that we don &apos;t have to control people , to be very bad ."
"we can support them , be good ."
that means we have to <unk> phosphorus .
"and by the way , if you want to do what they want to write , in germany , they &apos;re best <unk> by all the <unk> that &apos;s in <unk> ."
"unfortunately , not in <unk> , but maybe you can help the <unk> a little bit ."
because the <unk> could <unk> the best phosphorus .
and that &apos;s got to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s not really <unk> .
we &apos;ve now used for three years now .
"the <unk> government has explained that they will be the first country in the world , which is <unk> ."
but we need that in the total .
"understand , there are two countries that control the <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> percent of the world ."
there &apos;s a bunch of <unk> <unk> .
these are <unk> countries that control <unk> percent of the <unk> .
and the oil we will replace other <unk> .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace .
"so it &apos;s not about making the existing a little less bad , but it &apos;s about doing something right ."
and to ask all of the things that &apos;s right .
"that means that it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency ."
"in <unk> , you understand that &apos;s easier because in <unk> , the country is built on flowers ."
yes ?
"imagine if your wife &apos;s sad , if you &apos;re <unk> , if you &apos;re <unk> them , and you get <unk> ."
very inefficient .
"but , even effective , right ?"
or take a <unk> .
"a woman in germany , about six <unk> three <unk> in her life ."
that &apos;s the way .
"this is not a scientific <unk> , because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going to do it ."
"but a <unk> , even with that <unk> , can i tell you , is completely inefficient , but not , really , really , right ?"
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
"that &apos;s not how <unk> is , it &apos;s not <unk> ."
"so , what is the right ?"
"not to burn the <unk> a bit better and get it <unk> and to lose all the materials that are going to lose all the materials for the <unk> , but to ask the first time , how do you put a <unk> ?"
imagine mozart <unk> <unk> .
yes ?
"if i put them on dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> with <unk> and a glass of water to do it ."
"wonderful , right ?"
this is efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
"if you &apos;re <unk> in any <unk> , <unk> ?"
yes ?
"that means all what matters is not to save from <unk> , to reduce ."
all the <unk> .
"we tell people , oh , you don &apos;t have <unk> in the south ."
"no , it &apos;s just the right thing , right ?"
"every one you get to where you go from , yes , you get <unk> ."
but the wrong things .
"if you <unk> the wrong things , you have a <unk> ."
we think of north .
there &apos;s phosphorus that is <unk> .
"if you walk , yes , every footprint <unk> the ground ."
because the ground is going to die <unk> and the wind and the water <unk> the soil .
"but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint , every footprint is going to stay longer in the meadow ."
"so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that becomes a <unk> ."
not <unk> .
we say in germany . we &apos;re in sustainability .
yes ?
"but if i ask them , how do you do you do with your wife ?"
what do they say ?
sustainable .
"and i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?"
that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> .
"so not saving , <unk> , avoid ."
each waste is <unk> .
"and it &apos;s a <unk> , if you see in italy , people in the high <unk> like this , <unk> out of the car , <unk> ."
"because you know , that &apos;s a <unk> process ."
"it &apos;s a <unk> form of <unk> , yes ?"
you can show me there .
"but with the right design , please ."
"we &apos;ve developed an <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> , <unk> ."
you can <unk> them up where they go and stand .
"they build in two hours , all over the time ."
"and it contains seeds of rare plants , so that they &apos;re <unk> through the biodiversity of biodiversity ."
"that means we &apos;re useful , not less <unk> ."
so it &apos;s going to create two <unk> .
not all of them to be <unk> .
"a television or a <unk> that they use , just , they don &apos;t use them ."
"just the things that go out , like <unk> , like <unk> , who have to do the time that they have to go to biological systems ."
the things that are used to be used in <unk> systems .
"but today , we &apos;re just talking about the <unk> systems ."
yes ?
"for example , the <unk> , yes ?"
"<unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not a company that &apos;s <unk> for the company , but for that , you now help make this business succeed , you will do this products ."
because we don &apos;t do things more free .
yes ?
"so if i tell you about eating the food and i say , this is free from <unk> , then it helps you do nothing ."
"no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s in it ."
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic in it .
it &apos;s all in what &apos;s in it is useful .
"these are the first shoes that you can <unk> the <unk> on the <unk> and go to the <unk> <unk> into biological <unk> , right ?"
all of that is <unk> .
"and if we <unk> it , it <unk> us for <unk> , for nike , for <unk> and <unk> and <unk> all the <unk> ."
and that &apos;s half of all the world &apos;s <unk> by causing the <unk> .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to help them with questions like this .
"hey , <unk> , are you really serious about it ?"
because they &apos;ve now <unk> the <unk> twice the time .
and i &apos;m not so sure that they really <unk> .
"so , do you help me a little bit of this ."
but it &apos;s going .
yes .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been <unk> .
that &apos;s what happens .
"we can do the things now that when you &apos;re <unk> , if you &apos;re <unk> , you can go into biological biological biological processes ."
<unk> <unk> is in the same way .
there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> for this .
"this is the first <unk> <unk> . in fact , that &apos;s what it &apos;s done to go back to the circle ."
"so , in each store , you can <unk> the things ."
"if you come to that , yes ?"
do you remember the <unk> ?
if you &apos;re <unk> right now .
"all these <unk> are <unk> , almost ."
in the countries where people get to money .
"there &apos;s also on the <unk> , but in the landscape , right ?"
"if we change the plastic , so that it can go into biological systems if we change the <unk> , inside the <unk> , you can <unk> back to <unk> , you can <unk> with a baby in israel or <unk> trees ."
yes ?
"if you take these <unk> , you take <unk> , you <unk> the <unk> and you take the <unk> to plants ."
"so that &apos;s the baby <unk> for the whole life , ever from the beginning ."
"so we don &apos;t need <unk> , we can be <unk> ."
it &apos;s kind of a <unk> <unk> print .
"yes , so ."
yes ?
we can do that .
we can <unk> everything even more .
i started a <unk> .
"and by now , there &apos;s a lot of people working with it , and they can all get involved ."
"there &apos;s extra extra group of people to do , <unk> where everybody can ."
"so not saving anymore , <unk> , avoid <unk> , not <unk> , but smart <unk> ."
do you do that curious ?
thank you .
the work of the <unk> .
music as language .
"in the description of my talk , i wrote that i was as a <unk> , as a <unk> , so i understand in english <unk> ."
<unk> is the <unk> of the written <unk> in <unk> music .
"you don &apos;t just think about the word word that the text is <unk> into a different language , but also understand the words of words and <unk> , so it has to be a <unk> , everybody knows how to do it with <unk> ."
"already from <unk> into english , you can know more <unk> , because when you &apos;re about to <unk> or <unk> <unk> to poetry ."
"<unk> is a <unk> <unk> thing , which we do with our <unk> ."
"as a <unk> of a <unk> , i first got the written <unk> ."
you think that the <unk> in the <unk> has <unk> exactly what he <unk> .
"in fact , the <unk> are very <unk> and <unk> ."
"these <unk> are about exactly the same as <unk> as <unk> as a <unk> , even though very <unk> very seem to be <unk> <unk> , description of a landscape ."
"because in this <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the flowers don &apos;t smell , the degree of the <unk> , the <unk> of the wind doesn &apos;t hear you can &apos;t hear , not feel ."
"that means that the <unk> needs to be <unk> these <unk> of <unk> into another , which is <unk> , concrete <unk> ."
"today , i want to give you what else i &apos;m going to do , which is <unk> <unk> , which is even <unk> into a <unk> language ."
so basically a <unk> of the <unk> .
"so i <unk> to do this all the time , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be <unk> to me for me to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> ."
"so the music works , so for me , the same as the spoken language ."
the <unk> <unk> are actually the <unk> of the letters of a <unk> .
"so it &apos;s not just to read <unk> , and <unk> reading the <unk> on the piano or the right place on a <unk> ."
and that would be just the letters that you learned to paint .
the meaning of letters is that you can only <unk> the language .
so you need to have the <unk> of music at least as long as spoken to the spoken language .
"there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you learn it for the <unk> , just <unk> or you can speak active , until you get to the <unk> ."
the work of the <unk> starts to start the <unk> of a <unk> .
"after all , you &apos;re going to play a piece of <unk> , because you &apos;re <unk> by , you &apos;re <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> ."
you <unk> information about the piece in the <unk> .
"you read in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or whether you know , the words that you have to think about themselves ."
you studied the works that he had before and after .
you put <unk> on it .
the question of writing it .
how and what did he feel ?
"how did his <unk> , how the society and the politics ?"
all that &apos;s really interested in .
"you think of it in this time , by looking at contemporary images , or literature ."
"now , with time , you have a <unk> , you know , as a <unk> around the <unk> you play , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> , and feel <unk> it &apos;s <unk> and feel ."
the <unk> will be more and more to your friend with you .
"his cause to write the piece , will be more and more to my personal cause to play ."
"now , the <unk> are all other than a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , but it &apos;s just a <unk> , i now <unk> this <unk> to take it back and meaning it to <unk> ."
"i say , with my own words , which could be written between that framework ."
"i play <unk> , which those <unk> could have ."
"now for me , for the <unk> , and what you could do today for him today ."
"every sound that every sound gets a sense of it because i <unk> it , because it <unk> my own <unk> ."
"it has to be in the middle of me , and now i can &apos;t convince my audience that &apos;s my <unk> ."
"it &apos;s a very <unk> concert , and again , if i can have the experience that i have so long to <unk> how to experience ."
"as you <unk> a happy new day , even though , with the same <unk> of life , get up , get up , get up , to work , so i &apos;m also <unk> the same piece of new ."
"i &apos;ve become a day a <unk> , which goes down , and i get to see my <unk> , at night , when the morning , it &apos;s going to take a <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> again , again , again , as a home ."
"i &apos;m going to breathe true , <unk> or <unk> ."
"all that influenced me and <unk> as that , as my experience , as the <unk> ."
"and it &apos;s wonderful , even if i stand up with a <unk> on the stage , and we have the same <unk> ."
"and then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation ."
you get a new idea in and you get this <unk> with a reaction to you .
it &apos;s <unk> because then things that we don &apos;t have that stuff that we can and what you can &apos;t do as a <unk> .
"it &apos;s great to do great music in this way , and you &apos;ve been <unk> to the audience as the music <unk> ."
so every concert is another concert .
i will never play more like this in the moment .
i can &apos;t play as games today in 20 years .
"i &apos;m going to have more experience than today , and therefore , i &apos;m going to have to have more <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , with emotions and <unk> than today ."
"sure , i &apos;ll have some <unk> too , but for that new <unk> ."
i have a <unk> example of that .
"it was on a <unk> for <unk> at my beloved <unk> , professor <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> professor of <unk> <unk> here in <unk> ."
"unfortunately , i was a lot too young so that he was already <unk> when i finally started studying ."
"but i was very lucky , very early on , with <unk> years , and so i was in my <unk> , on the <unk> ."
"i was <unk> when i was on one of his courses , and i was <unk> the last of the four <unk> by chopin , a <unk> <unk> ."
he asked me what the <unk> of this <unk> was for me .
this is a <unk> part .
"and in my <unk> , i said , expectation ."
"and he was <unk> and saying , so ?"
that has to be the <unk> .
"because for me , it means memory ."
he was already talking about <unk> .
"<unk> , with <unk> , you have to do any dreams , but no major <unk> ."
"i play today the piece of all years and over and over it turned out to me , even though no one has changed ."
"every time it &apos;s <unk> , because i always read something new ."
"so , an example from a very different area , and <unk> did the <unk> <unk> ."
"it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different <unk> , at <unk> ."
"he translated the <unk> <unk> <unk> , as he saw , as she saw , as she did at the moment ."
his personal <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a <unk> is the <unk> .
"now i have <unk> older than the chopin , as the <unk> , when he wrote the piece ."
he was only living for <unk> years .
"and i think it &apos;s important to look back into the <unk> , even though i can <unk> them ."
"to keep <unk> , just with the <unk> ."
because the <unk> are the only connection to him .
"in fact , when he died ."
"now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?"
"i said , well , you need about the same thing for the spoken language ."
often the <unk> is so that you &apos;re just learning the <unk> .
you learn to read the one word before you just speak a word .
you learn to find the <unk> <unk> on the instrument .
"if all the fingers in time and right as it goes into the <unk> , they &apos;re going to move , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> like music ."
"when that happens , students get the <unk> piece ."
and it &apos;s not going to talk about <unk> .
"well , there &apos;s a quick <unk> , which is a quick piece ."
"<unk> , slowly ."
"<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and b , <unk> <unk> ."
that &apos;s the most of you here .
"but even if you <unk> these data , it still stays a kind of technical ."
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you &apos;re getting a little bit of <unk> .
and that is that to make music that should be <unk> and feel their own musical musical <unk> .
that &apos;s what they sing .
"a kid that didn &apos;t learn the singing because it &apos;s not going to have parents to have <unk> , it &apos;s not going to do it ."
this is like <unk> .
"it &apos;s necessary to have its own <unk> and the idea of music , and then it &apos;s a more possibility to get over a sense , so that they &apos;re going to make the instrument ."
"people who never have <unk> , have never felt immediately with their own body , like it is to form a sound ."
and a <unk> with his own breath .
and that &apos;s the <unk> of our body .
"our vocal chords , we like , to dance , to our hands and feet ."
so the <unk> in the piano is the sequel to my fingers .
the <unk> is <unk> from the <unk> and the rhythm .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> today with music is not there .
you don &apos;t need to do it even more even more <unk> when it becomes a boring .
not anymore to sing or <unk> .
every single music is <unk> when you get all the time from music .
"and there &apos;s certain of you that say , &quot; yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ? &quot;"
"i mean , you can &apos;t sing , you can &apos;t sing , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?"
"or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?"
"it &apos;s not too late to start with whether you can &apos;t figure it out , or to learn how to learn these little muscles that <unk> the reef , the guy ."
that &apos;s what you can train .
"or c , because you &apos;ve got them to tell them they &apos;re <unk> ."
"i think , as <unk> , was this diagnosis ?"
"have you got a <unk> or a <unk> , how do you say it &apos;s beautiful ?"
"or d , you don &apos;t like music and you want to have <unk> to do so ."
"but what i would do , you know , what i mean , because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing ."
but maybe you can also <unk> them .
"well , you can see , all of the cases , nobody has to be a <unk> ."
"but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand any of the <unk> music ."
i can &apos;t say it &apos;s good or bad .
"and i say that i can &apos;t answer , but i &apos;ll tell you , if you like it or not ."
"because i don &apos;t think it doesn &apos;t say somebody , i don &apos;t know if i tastes like it , because i can &apos;t cook ."
"so , they don &apos;t eat it , just because they can &apos;t cook ."
"so you don &apos;t have to <unk> music , because it doesn &apos;t play ."
listen to them and say that they &apos;re <unk> or not .
whether it &apos;s music to <unk> or <unk> music .
tell what you feel about .
"and over time , they also get <unk> , and they want to have some more <unk> or even <unk> <unk> differences ."
why am i asking now by my audience that it &apos;s active now ?
because the music is language and a language is to communicate .
"a piece of art that you never look at , has no force to be ."
the food that was <unk> by a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> has to be <unk> and not just looking at <unk> or <unk> .
"so , please listen to me , when a music is played ."
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
"if you go into an environment where adults are active music , or at least active music , you &apos;re hearing a child , it &apos;s very easy for a <unk> , to ask , what color has your <unk> ?"
can you play me in blue now ?
"and the child plays , after a <unk> , instead of having a red <unk> ."
and this sounds very different from before .
that was the first beginning of a <unk> <unk> .
so the first step is to take a interpretation .
"and what happens when you play a piece of today that was originally a <unk> before , <unk> or <unk> , <unk> years ago ?"
and the way to <unk> the instruments .
there were no <unk> at the time as an instrument .
it was just not even invented .
i think the <unk> would have been <unk> if he had the most <unk> opportunities of modern history .
i can have the <unk> <unk> today that had <unk> on the modern wing to <unk> what a <unk> can &apos;t .
"and you know , too , too , that he heard more than he had been deaf ."
"today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that has <unk> of <unk> ."
so the <unk> are <unk> to us <unk> that <unk> the pieces .
"so they &apos;re <unk> by <unk> , which they only have <unk> in the <unk> ."
and also what you would think today in the <unk> .
or what i &apos;d <unk> to me today is that what you might think you could do .
thank you .
"you know , what &apos;s the heart ?"
did you know ?
and how did that feel ?
<unk> .
i have a friend that &apos;s driving a <unk> .
"if i come , with my little <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> me , that feeling comes out ."
i &apos;m <unk> something through the head .
"i say , <unk> , what do you need to have that big car ?"
it &apos;s already lost half of its own year .
"and at all , you &apos;re <unk> much less than i ."
why do i have to afford to afford little car ?
"and then i immediately falls to one , that &apos;s <unk> ."
it &apos;s against justice .
"and as i say the word justice , that &apos;s a <unk> way away ."
our organism has invented a great way to make such emotion as your emotions just go out and get away .
they can also try that with words like <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
"i want to explain to you with this <unk> today , or something that is <unk> , which is probably familiar with you ."
the <unk> is from the <unk> .
"but don &apos;t think about the <unk> , as you may have heard about when people say , nobody has got the <unk> of the wall ."
and then rocks <unk> them so he <unk> the <unk> .
"so , you can see that the liars don &apos;t believe what the liars will say ."
it makes <unk> easy to check that he &apos;s doing it all different .
"he &apos;s <unk> them , and it &apos;s not <unk> ."
"no , the <unk> i &apos;m talking about who has to do with it , that it <unk> itself ."
they need this <unk> to get a <unk> to get a <unk> .
"they can get less , yes , or less , or they can get to <unk> ."
they need time .
one of the time is an <unk> that you may know .
the <unk> painter <unk> <unk> once <unk> a woman .
"this woman <unk> , and she <unk> , wouldn &apos;t see her ."
"<unk> &apos;s answer , they &apos;re just waiting ."
it will always be more similar .
"and when you laugh , you know how important that <unk> is and how much time you need to learn to experience what artists can tell you what kind of is very good ."
because artists have a <unk> relationship to <unk> .
"and the artist <unk> tell you something with them , and especially this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see when she looks just looking into the mirror ."
"and the artist shares them in such a <unk> of something you &apos;re going to know , when you &apos;re just going to look back at this art piece of art ."
"then this <unk> <unk> , it couldn &apos;t see them , and it will always <unk> them ."
"here you have this <unk> , which is the <unk> that we can use as a great invention to the <unk> of our <unk> ."
"and not just in art , even in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the mythology of mythology , it <unk> again ."
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror every morning and asked who is who is the most beautiful in the country ?
"and one day , this mirror says , yes there &apos;s a <unk> ."
behind the seven mountains and so on .
"and you know how much <unk> from this true <unk> , the mirror can &apos;t lie from this mirror , from the true <unk> <unk> ."
"but we should just be familiar with this , so you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else ."
"here &apos;s what we need to do with <unk> <unk> , again , to <unk> again ."
"we need to put this place on this place that <unk> us without <unk> it , without which we can ."
"we have not only in art , in the art of science , but also in science , the great <unk> ."
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s <unk> of <unk> .
"they heard about this book of charles darwin , the origin of species and the <unk> of people ."
"that the human <unk> should be <unk> and , at least , there were a common <unk> between people and monkeys ."
"and then she <unk> her to her husband and said , that &apos;s not true what charles wrote ."
the human being to have a common <unk> or a common ancestors .
"no , no , that &apos;s not ."
"and if it &apos;s true , we need to prevent people from getting <unk> ."
why do we have to prevent people from <unk> from something when it is true ?
because we can &apos;t live without these <unk> .
"because we <unk> this feeling , to be great , by the highest creatures , not from one of these <unk> , from such a <unk> such as an organism that exists to one , a rock , and otherwise , for us , for things ."
"so , we can &apos;t <unk> these things ."
"we need to prevent people from <unk> from things , mostly when they &apos;re true ."
"and you see how slowly this <unk> look , and how the <unk> that he <unk> , that he <unk> on something else &apos;s <unk> on this great picture of ourselves , i want to give you another story ."
"a particularly beautiful story , as i mean ."
my wife told me .
"she came up one day , she was <unk> , and she told her about a student ."
a <unk> student .
"they like to him especially , because he got a <unk> for <unk> ."
"and she asked him , what are you , because your <unk> ?"
"and that &apos;s what he says , &quot; well , i &apos;m on the fire ."
"and because i &apos;m interested in the fire fire fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things ."
"yes , you feel like you &apos;re <unk> at that point . there &apos;s nothing there ."
"i &apos;ve said , &quot; whenever a human being in a moral <unk> , &quot; because it &apos;s the <unk> , we should try to replace it through the <unk> ."
do you know that once and then you experience the sentence .
"and while i &apos;m at the fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things ."
you feel that &apos;s the really truth behind the <unk> .
so a little <unk> that &apos;s interested in the <unk> .
the <unk> is interested in <unk> .
but there &apos;s no <unk> where we can <unk> to where we learn to how to make fire .
"there &apos;s just the <unk> , the <unk> fire ."
and there he got himself there .
"and <unk> , you know , you don &apos;t tell him that you &apos;re <unk> to <unk> somewhere and <unk> when the fire was going to be out ."
"no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of <unk> to <unk> the other , the other only thing they do is when they put fire on fire ."
here you have these little <unk> .
"this <unk> that this <unk> knew that in the <unk> of the <unk> , he actually knew about the fire , he &apos;s actually <unk> , but he can &apos;t say that loud ."
"here you have this <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> , which is <unk> right now , without that you can do something , and the things that you know , they &apos;re very different , so they can be <unk> for them and they <unk> much better ."
and that &apos;s how we get these words that we also use in the political <unk> <unk> <unk> .
"in fact , we know that something else is the case ."
"but we know , if we &apos;re <unk> , the social issues are very <unk> very sensitive ."
we can &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s impossible to <unk> things like this in society that &apos;s supposed to work .
"i want to <unk> you now , which we &apos;ve found out in my <unk> ."
"and after the logic of this <unk> , the willingness , the willingness to give another one reality that we actually know about in the <unk> that it &apos;s <unk> to spread out ."
"i want to share with you two , maybe three examples ."
"the first example is <unk> , which many of you know , and some of you don &apos;t even need , very few of them don &apos;t need ."
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
"the soul is so <unk> , about <unk> ."
"it &apos;s something that &apos;s not <unk> , <unk> nature ."
"and if you have people who are the solid belief that they own a soul , or you can also say that they have been <unk> by the soul , as a body , they &apos;re <unk> to be so much as the body as much as the body ."
"and by this soul , you think that you somehow in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> , it &apos;s called <unk> , which is the <unk> , <unk> ."
"and if that <unk> has <unk> about people , then it &apos;s <unk> with , with nature , with nature , that can only live with a soul ."
and then he can <unk> .
this is the idea of how the soul <unk> .
so it &apos;s going to get out of the outside .
so we should be able to perceive as something that should be <unk> for our lives .
"and if you have these <unk> eyes , then you understand the logic that we &apos;re <unk> with , through a <unk> world , can make our better ."
because now you can apply a <unk> .
"<unk> , they know from school ."
this is a <unk> that describes us a logic .
this is the most important part in my talk .
"here &apos;s a thing that &apos;s going to have a <unk> , but also to lie ."
that &apos;s because <unk> that logic is simply about to apply that logic .
"in this <unk> , three <unk> come from ."
"the first sentence is , <unk> says there is no soul ."
"so the second sentence is , if <unk> is right , it doesn &apos;t have a soul ."
now there &apos;s a third set .
i &apos;ve <unk> it in this particular place .
a <unk> sentence that <unk> immediately <unk> people who have a <unk> feeling for a soul .
"the people who have no soul , who is dead and can &apos;t say anything ."
and here you feel it .
"here &apos;s this logic , yes , in this <unk> talk , for expression ."
you see it immediately .
"the first two <unk> , which is <unk> ."
i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell the reality .
i can say the <unk> is a man .
"and if i have right , that &apos;s a <unk> man ."
"if i &apos;m not right , the <unk> is not a man ."
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what it is .
i can argue everything .
"but the key thing is , if i have right , it &apos;s true ."
"so when <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul ."
"second , when he &apos;s right , he &apos;s got no soul ."
these things are <unk> .
"and now our <unk> conscious consciousness immediately , you can do something ."
"it depends on a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have to do with the first two <unk> , and it does as the opposite of the first <unk> of the <unk> ."
because actually we have to prove if there &apos;s a soul or not .
"but with this logic , it just uses it to be two <unk> <unk> , and a third <unk> that looks like he could have to do something with it , so we can save our <unk> ."
"so , we do as if it &apos;s impossible to live without a soul ."
and we are very happy about it .
we can <unk> these things in different ways .
"in the present , we have a very modern example of the <unk> <unk> ."
"<unk> , you have to think of another <unk> issue , a <unk> <unk> from philosophy , <unk> ."
"that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing with that , we &apos;re going to go back to the <unk> century ."
"there was a <unk> named <unk> named <unk> , and after that , the <unk> named <unk> ."
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> that is <unk> from nature .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
this is a <unk> .
"and if you put the <unk> in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , then he <unk> ."
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
so he &apos;s in the middle .
so the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> <unk> to each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
"and if you get another example , if you get the <unk> bigger , it takes a <unk> bigger , it doesn &apos;t need any <unk> and nothing at all ."
it &apos;s going to go to the right thought .
"so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of <unk> in nature , you &apos;re <unk> by the bigger , you &apos;re going to have a <unk> , you &apos;re also too quickly <unk> the feeling of a free will ."
"and if we &apos;re in <unk> here , in <unk> , i remember the <unk> for <unk> ."
"there &apos;s a <unk> , which is called the wolf , and he says , &quot; you know , &quot; wolf , &quot; wolf <unk> , there &apos;s no <unk> . &quot;"
"now we can form the second sentence and then say , if the wolf is right , the <unk> , it &apos;s not <unk> ."
these <unk> are absolutely <unk> and <unk> .
and so what we can read in the <unk> <unk> that they find in this third sentence .
"and this looks like this , which is not <unk> , it can &apos;t be <unk> for its actions and <unk> to responsibility , and it &apos;s <unk> <unk> ."
and you have it again .
"in fact , you &apos;d have to prove <unk> , whether it &apos;s something like <unk> ."
"but the logic of deception allows us to do that , as the first sentence of <unk> <unk> , as if you had to <unk> the opposite of all of the evidence without evidence ."
"and now , you can just do anything , if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , that <unk> to <unk> ."
"so , for example , if you &apos;re at a time , you can be able to see a human one , there are no <unk> ."
"and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , which is called <unk> ."
"they can &apos;t call them , that would be a little bit more politically <unk> ."
they say there &apos;s no <unk> .
"they &apos;ll immediately be given to one , for granted , that can &apos;t experience you ."
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
"because while you &apos;re busy , you know , you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , the man is very happy ."
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s got them .
"because he led them to a <unk> , which he didn &apos;t <unk> ."
because actually this person is not really interested in prove .
it &apos;s just interested in <unk> itself from the need to prove to prove that there are <unk> .
"so , in the kind of <unk> of the <unk> , they experience the <unk> of the <unk> ."
"and once again , you have a chance to feel that <unk> to other people , because they &apos;re going to do other people , if they &apos;re not going to remember that kind of <unk> in their <unk> ."
thank you for your attention .
"yes , good day ."
i &apos;ve been allowed to ask for me to say if i could mention it .
"she &apos;s one of the <unk> here of this great event , and asked me to keep a talk here and <unk> my idea ."
"i have to say , you &apos;ve got it , you know , i &apos;ve got it hard to talk about my idea ."
and i may be able to imagine my <unk> that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
"but it &apos;s , of course , all the sum , very much of a ideas ."
"i &apos;m probably probably the two nice girls there , because i &apos;m probably <unk> to the generation that has been <unk> for this bad <unk> image , because i &apos;ve been starting to study <unk> in <unk> <unk> , college , i think , you know , i &apos;m probably , i &apos;m probably , i think i"
"and i was in the middle of the <unk> years to berlin , because i wanted to do <unk> <unk> <unk> and that was not in <unk> ."
there was the <unk> <unk> .
"the <unk> <unk> , all the <unk> , which was called the <unk> <unk> ."
the <unk> today is <unk> .
because a good engineer has either <unk> cars or <unk> .
but something like <unk> <unk> from the <unk> from a hundred watts of <unk> that was a <unk> .
"and in berlin , there was a crazy <unk> ."
"i &apos;m the <unk> grateful that he <unk> the word again , because after the <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t use the word , because everything left was bad ."
but it wasn &apos;t that much in the <unk> years .
"there was so that there was <unk> <unk> , and there was a <unk> in <unk> in <unk> where you were <unk> the evil ."
"the <unk> of the <unk> , but that was called <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and i started the middle of the <unk> ."
"and yes , a lot of what &apos;s told today was , i &apos;m <unk> very , because many , many beautiful <unk> that i &apos;ve also been able to do ."
"i worked in the <unk> for a few years , which was <unk> ."
we were 20 people .
"if you were no , the <unk> , it was a <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;ve spent 10 years long , i &apos;ve been <unk> to say , i really <unk> my <unk> , maybe a <unk> &apos;s <unk> thing , because everyone has <unk> your <unk> with him ."
it &apos;s busy <unk> .
"and that was really , very , very <unk> and then you get into this kind of phase , in a picture , where i asked a picture to you , a thousand years ago , that &apos;s what it really meant to be , of course , in the <unk> , really , really , really , really"
"and i got to <unk> up to <unk> , and then we <unk> with friends , i <unk> the company , who <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> of a major <unk> of the world ."
"a <unk> , but we also have the problem of a growing <unk> , and we then have <unk> , a little group , decided we start to go back and back back and go back and go back to the next to our <unk> and <unk> to our <unk> ."
and there i brought you a project that i want to imagine now .
"and the title of the <unk> was , as you get to a hundred percent <unk> ."
"and we just started to ask a relatively <unk> story , where you could make a <unk> sense of it ."
"on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> ."
"yes , that &apos;s the data ."
there &apos;s a half of a half people .
they have a <unk> of <unk> <unk> percent today .
"and the question is , why don &apos;t they have ?"
this is just not <unk> .
"if you <unk> more <unk> each other , it starts to <unk> ."
i always tell the politicians when you see our <unk> in <unk> .
"they say , &quot; why ?"
we have 20 percent in germany .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
"but that &apos;s not true , we have seen in europe seven percent , and our net is <unk> the european ."
"if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island ."
"the question was just simply , <unk> , the first <unk> of the <unk> started with the island , just <unk> out of the island ."
"as big as big as a battery would be so much , so you would be a <unk> , 30 , 30 , <unk> , <unk> , maybe even <unk> <unk> <unk> percent ."
"and yes , i &apos;ll go back again ."
the conventional system looks like this in the world .
"by the way , about a hundred <unk> electrical performance will be <unk> at <unk> <unk> in the world ."
"that &apos;s the equivalent of a hundred <unk> <unk> , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere ."
the <unk> of the world that &apos;s going to be <unk> with <unk> because you don &apos;t need a <unk> .
that &apos;s going fast .
you put it in that <unk> .
and then it looks like this in the rule .
"and they &apos;re still in the <unk> , two of the <unk> , two will always wait ."
"yes , this is what a <unk> is just the burden ."
we also have very precise data .
"and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , in the rule , the rule is a <unk> system that can <unk> a system , which can only be in small quantities here ."
"our goal was to say , &quot; okay . &quot;"
"the <unk> is <unk> and the wind , the wind will <unk> the burden so that they can map the larger proportion ."
"and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent <unk> , energy energy per year , not the performance right now , you have to take the <unk> off ."
that &apos;s what the moment you have to do is to worry about that renewables are sort of going to take over the whole web .
"you can only do that if you &apos;re in some way , in some way , you can get <unk> ."
that &apos;s what nobody did in the world .
"this is in the small style , so you can also use your car over a little bit of <unk> ."
"people always ask me , what do you do , because actually in <unk> ?"
that &apos;s all about .
"but if you want to <unk> multiple of those <unk> and the to build a web , it &apos;s extremely complicated ."
"and our goal was to come to <unk> percent of the <unk> percent , and then still here , the rest of the rest , the last 10 , 20 percent with 20 , 20 percent , that will be very expensive and not working ."
"that will be a <unk> , which then , hydrogen , <unk> , power , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or <unk> it will be ."
"they need to go on a <unk> and <unk> , and not just <unk> <unk> ."
"we just wanted to know what is with a normal , <unk> battery ."
how far do you get there ?
and then a whole bunch of <unk> <unk> .
"and wind and sun and <unk> and the <unk> and came to the outcome , a very <unk> result , that you need to go through the <unk> system that after 20 years of <unk> a <unk> of <unk> cents a <unk> <unk> <unk> , for a <unk> car ."
these were the <unk> calculations six years ago .
"and then we said , &quot; okay ."
"it &apos;s great , we have a <unk> ."
"we &apos;re cheaper to have the <unk> <unk> , if the <unk> <unk> is growing five percent per year ."
and then we started <unk> with the <unk> .
what would have to be done ?
"i &apos;ve been looking for <unk> , i &apos;ve been looking for new <unk> ."
"we were there until the time five people , to build a society ."
and here &apos;s the <unk> .
"the brown is , in the conventional system , the green is our system ."
"that our system has a <unk> , it &apos;s because we &apos;re still spending 20 percent of <unk> , and also a <unk> on the other things that other things are not <unk> ."
"and the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> on the island , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to find ."
"we want to support them , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the problem ."
"and so we decided to build a <unk> in berlin , in which we sort of can actually map the electric <unk> of the island at the island of three ."
that means we &apos;ve been looking for <unk> to find the largest battery of the world &apos;s battery .
here she is .
"the <unk> comes out of asia , in the case of japan ."
"and <unk> , it &apos;s been <unk> in the <unk> years of <unk> , today <unk> , and then <unk> became the japanese ."
"it &apos;s a very , very , very big battery ."
"she has an <unk> performance , and it can take six hours to this performance , and that &apos;s the battery we have as <unk> as a <unk> ."
and then they set them .
"we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as he is there , in fact , <unk> the entire behavior of this whole network , in the <unk> , so it looks like this , and the camera is the bottom here , the battery is the <unk> here , and the number of the"
"and we &apos;re going to simulate this whole <unk> that <unk> the cable , and sort of <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ."
and here you can see it all the time .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> on the web .
"here we see this again again , again , again , the <unk> , again , the whole , <unk> <unk> ."
"and what we &apos;ve done for <unk> was then done the <unk> , until <unk> , in the same thing , which was basically , between the single system , to develop software , we &apos;ve done ."
"so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we &apos;re define ourselves as a company that &apos;s only between the subject and the subject of the web and everything ."
"you have to communicate to the battery , you have to communicate , you have to communicate on the web , and that &apos;s very complicated ."
"the beautiful thing is about that , in this island , you can basically take all the <unk> of problems that we can get when we want to increase our <unk> of renewables ."
"so this whole discussion of how is going to be <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , like this , to go to the island , for example , we &apos;ve <unk> the <unk> to 30 percent , so we <unk> the sun and the wind ."
<unk> <unk> then <unk> .
"so <unk> , a <unk> <unk> everywhere ."
"we can start out on the island , we can start to integrate <unk> , <unk> , because the burden of <unk> ."
"that means , if you &apos;re at <unk> percent <unk> , you &apos;re not going to do that without <unk> ."
"you can <unk> through n , you can <unk> through the <unk> , yes , you should do that in every case , the <unk> <unk> , but you will never get on <unk> ."
and that &apos;s the <unk> little bit of the message .
"so , also , many people come and look at this because you can see what the problems you get ."
"if we <unk> the <unk> , then you don &apos;t have the <unk> of the <unk> mass that causes a certain amount of <unk> in the network ."
"and our <unk> <unk> system is basically just <unk> <unk> <unk> of large , where the wave of wave is <unk> all over europe ."
"we &apos;re looking at the web , seeing the <unk> <unk> , and when it &apos;s going to be five <unk> of the <unk> age , we &apos;re going to start a few <unk> , <unk> back a little <unk> , then we get back up again ."
that &apos;s the system .
"and of course , that &apos;s incredibly <unk> ."
"if you put it somewhere somewhere , it takes a little bit of time ."
the <unk> <unk> has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
"and in the time , you can respond to something else ."
"if you don &apos;t have that , these <unk> mass , then you have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> ."
and we can <unk> this big battery with two <unk> .
and there &apos;s some <unk> that you can see .
"and the message is , we need to <unk> to these <unk> <unk> mass , if we were to , in some way , 20 , 20 , 30 percent , 30 , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to reach ."
we need to <unk> our <unk> capacity to the net .
<unk> is simply the power station with keeping the frequency .
"yes , that &apos;s a <unk> at the moment , <unk> from <unk> , because we don &apos;t , or <unk> , because it &apos;s not ."
"and we &apos;re trying to <unk> that you can <unk> the capacity to <unk> the <unk> , by <unk> with building concrete ."
"there &apos;s been <unk> , also , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies ."
"and then , to that purpose , people get there and they look at our <unk> , basically , our <unk> ."
"and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can make a piece of future ."
"and many discussions that i had had in the last six years , were similar to the discussion i had in the last 30 years , to the subject ."
"no , <unk> , <unk> , we have all <unk> , never <unk> ."
we have 30 <unk> <unk> in germany .
this is <unk> .
"and i just go from that , in the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to have the same capacity for <unk> <unk> in the world ."
just that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s going to be a whole bunch of <unk> and arguments .
"the beautiful is that i &apos;ve just <unk> in the last two years , the scientists have turned to my <unk> ."
"we have now over 10 million <unk> of <unk> , too , to <unk> now to <unk> to the german web ."
that &apos;s going to happen in the next april .
"so , you also see that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s just from this <unk> to yes , to the idea , 100 percent <unk> <unk> ."
"and if you have a hundred percent <unk> , it &apos;s like a <unk> system ."
"so , we &apos;ve always tried to talk so far , these <unk> that make you feel like you &apos;ve got a very little web , which has nothing to do with your <unk> ."
"but the question is , really easy , if you &apos;re completely <unk> of <unk> fossil fuels , or <unk> , that will be <unk> anywhere in the world and become <unk> , you &apos;re not an island ."
they &apos;re using them to only what &apos;s there on the sun and wind there is where they live .
"and that &apos;s a little bit of our vision of a <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;m also grateful that they said <unk> ."
"and that &apos;s that what we do , and <unk> come from , also the talk of <unk> that you can be a <unk> and use again , and you &apos;re using a little bit together ."
"and i &apos;m very good , i just want to <unk> you in the sense that you can have a little bit of crazy and have a vision ."
"and you have to really stay <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going to be ."
thank you .
"when steve <unk> , the <unk> of los angeles times , one day after the streets of los angeles went to los angeles , he heard a wonderful music ."
"she came from a man , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who played on a violin , who had only two <unk> ."
"many of you will know the story because of <unk> articles on it later , the book <unk> was <unk> , with robert <unk> and <unk> as steve <unk> and <unk> anthony <unk> <unk> , the <unk> photographer , <unk> after his early <unk> and a professional career ."
"<unk> left <unk> , had a <unk> and 30 years later he lived on the streets of <unk> row in los angeles <unk> ."
"i <unk> you all to read <unk> &apos;s book , or to look at the film , so they don &apos;t just understand the wonderful <unk> that happened between those two men , but as the music allows them to create , and the road to the instrument , it , and the instrument , as the instrument that"
"i met <unk> <unk> in 2008 two years ago , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
he just heard a presentation of jazz and <unk> <unk> <unk> and came out of the stage to imagine me .
"he talked about a very <unk> and <unk> clay on <unk> and <unk> and <unk> about how the <unk> would never create in the baseball world , and that was all the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> &apos;s <unk> ."
"we got to talk about music . and a few days later , i got an email that was <unk> for me to <unk> ."
"i have to mention that <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , because he was already treated with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> were <unk> , a trauma that has been <unk> his whole life ."
"and as a result of it , he &apos;s particularly <unk> for these <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he <unk> to the streets of <unk> row of <unk> , <unk> , always <unk> the <unk> of his own <unk> ."
"and in exactly a <unk> , when we were <unk> , when we started with our first <unk> <unk> <unk> , he started this <unk> <unk> <unk> in his eyes , and he was completely lost ."
he talked about invisible <unk> and smoke about how to <unk> someone in sleep .
"i was afraid , not <unk> , but i was afraid that i could lose him that he could <unk> into a <unk> , and that i could destroy his relationship to the <unk> , when i started to talk about <unk> and <unk> and different <unk> ."
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of <unk> .
"and as i was playing , i fell to me in <unk> , a <unk> <unk> was going to go ."
"it was like he was <unk> under the invisible <unk> , a chemical reaction of the reaction of his game ."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> himself into understanding , <unk> , <unk> curiosity and <unk> ."
"and as a miracle , he took his violin , and started to play at heard a few <unk> of <unk> from playing and asked me to play it , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ."
"and we started talking about music , <unk> from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> from <unk> to <unk> ."
"and i realized that it &apos;s not just a <unk> knowledge of music , but it also <unk> with her an <unk> personal relationship ."
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i only know of my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
"by playing music and talking about music , this was from this <unk> , <unk> man who was <unk> from the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
music is medicine . music is changing .
"for <unk> , music is <unk> health ."
because the music allows him and <unk> his thoughts and <unk> with his imagination and creativity in something <unk> .
and so he <unk> his <unk> .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
"and that &apos;s why we &apos;re doing music , so that we &apos;re doing something that is inside us , deep inside our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our artistic lens , can actually form to a society ."
"and the reality of that <unk> is all of us , and moves , and <unk> us ."
"what <unk> <unk> did , the music brought it back into a community of friends ."
the <unk> force of music brought him back into a family of <unk> who realized his talent and <unk> him .
"and i &apos;ll end up with <unk> music , whether in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or in <unk> <unk> , because he reminds me of why i was a musician ."
thank you .
<unk> <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert full .
robert : i want to play something i &apos;ve <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i &apos;ve got a lot of fish in my life .
i have only two <unk> .
"the first , that was more like a passionate <unk> ."
"it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> ."
what a fish .
"even better , he was <unk> to the highest standards of sustainability <unk> ."
so you could feel like you could sell him .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
"and one day , the <unk> called the company , and i said , if i could give you a event , about the sustainability of the <unk> ."
"&quot; of course , i said ."
"here was a company trying to solve what this <unk> problem was for our jihad , and how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?"
in the last 50 years we &apos;ve <unk> the ocean as we <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
"90 percent of the big fish we love , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , they &apos;ve collapsed ."
it &apos;s almost nothing left left .
"so , probably or <unk> , <unk> , is a part of our future ."
"many arguments are about it . <unk> <unk> the environment , most of you , and they &apos;re inefficient , and we take tuna -- a great <unk> ."
he has a <unk> of 15 .
that means 15 pounds of <unk> is needed to get a <unk> <unk> .
not very sustainable .
they don &apos;t taste very well .
so here was finally a company that tried to do it right .
i wanted to <unk> them .
"the day before the event , i called the <unk> of the <unk> for the company ."
we call it <unk> .
"&quot; <unk> , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for this , as far outside the sea , that their environment is not <unk> . &quot;"
"&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far outside that waste of our fish will spread out , not focused . &quot;"
"and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world ."
"this <unk> of <unk> <unk> to 1 , he said ."
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
"<unk> to one , great ."
&quot; <unk> to one ? what do you <unk> ? &quot;
"&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said ."
"&quot; great &quot; i said , i <unk> ."
"and that evening i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a <unk> protein ?"
"so i called the next day , just before the event , <unk> ."
"i said , &quot; <unk> , what about sustainable proteins are like ? &quot;"
he said he didn &apos;t <unk> that . he &apos;ll be <unk> .
"well , i <unk> with a few people in the company . nobody could give me a <unk> answer , until finally , i got to <unk> the <unk> ."
we call it too <unk> .
"&quot; <unk> , &quot; i said , &quot; what is sustainable proteins ? &quot;"
"now , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> ."
"i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;"
"he said , &quot; yes , <unk> , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . &quot;"
"i said , &quot; how much of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;"
in the <unk> of maybe two percent .
"&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said ."
"i said , &quot; <unk> , what &apos;s sustainable to <unk> chicken ? &quot;"
"there was a long <unk> in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;"
i <unk> from this fish .
"no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> ."
i &apos;m even a <unk> .
"no , i actually <unk> from this fish , because i &apos;m <unk> with god who &apos;s <unk> for that <unk> ."
"this second fish , this is a different kind of <unk> ."
"it &apos;s the most <unk> way that you know , the kind of thing you &apos;re ever learning your fish , you &apos;re learning the fish more ."
i <unk> it in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> had talked about this fish for a long time .
it <unk> us .
"he came up with a <unk> <unk> , almost white color ."
the <unk> had him <unk> .
twice .
he was still <unk> .
"who can make a fish so good , <unk> after he got <unk> ?"
"i can &apos;t , but this guy can ."
"let &apos;s call it <unk> . in fact , he &apos;s called <unk> ."
"and no , he didn &apos;t <unk> the fish , and he &apos;s not a <unk> , at least in the way that they understand and i can understand ."
he &apos;s a <unk> at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner .
it &apos;s near the <unk> of the river .
"until the 1980s , the <unk> was in the hands of <unk> ."
they were <unk> <unk> on what was basically <unk> .
they made it by <unk> the country .
they built this <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> water out of the land and out into the river .
"well , they couldn &apos;t do that the <unk> , not economic growth ."
and <unk> was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of birds to <unk> what many birds are for this place .
and so <unk> has a <unk> company called <unk> the country .
what did they do ?
they have the <unk> of the river .
they &apos;ve literally <unk> the <unk> .
"instead of the water , they used the <unk> to <unk> the water back again ."
they <unk> the <unk> .
"they <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and his company <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> ."
the <unk> is incredible .
"i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything ."
"they &apos;re <unk> out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you &apos;re all seeing are <unk> <unk> and the density , <unk> march ."
i was there not a long time ago at all .
"it &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts darwin and a part of a &quot; <unk> to stop . &quot;"
"okay ? so we were and we <unk> through the <unk> and i was <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> up to my <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> into silence ."
here he <unk> a rare <unk> .
now he &apos;s mentioned the <unk> of <unk> .
"and here , here he sees a pattern of <unk> that reminds him of the <unk> giraffe ."
it turns out that <unk> has spent the largest part of its career in <unk> in africa .
i asked him how he got to be a <unk> .
"he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish ."
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and <unk> over more of rare birds and algae and <unk> .
"and don &apos;t understand me , that was really <unk> , you know , the <unk> community , so in the way ."
"it &apos;s great , but i was in love ."
and my head was weak to <unk> over this <unk> piece of <unk> <unk> that i had on the <unk> .
"so i <unk> it . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does your fish feel so good ? &quot;"
he showed up on the algae .
"&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the <unk> , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible ."
but what do you eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
"well , he goes on and told me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish would eat , which would eat in the wild ."
"the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , it &apos;s what the fish <unk> ."
"the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally <unk> ."
there &apos;s no food .
the one of the <unk> is that they &apos;re not <unk> their animals ?
"i went around this <unk> <unk> day later , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems to be like , differently than any <unk> i &apos;ve ever been to , &quot; how much you do , &quot; how do you do ? &quot;"
and the moment was that if a <unk> would have a <unk> to have a <unk> .
"and we <unk> the corner , and we offered to the <unk> of the <unk> of course , thousands and thousands of <unk> of <unk> <unk> , literally <unk> <unk> the eye ."
"&quot; that is success , &quot; he said ."
"&quot; look at your <unk> , pink ."
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was very <unk> .
"i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you have your fish ? &quot;"
"&quot; yes , he said ."
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
"well , last year , in this <unk> of 600,000 birds were in more than 250 different types of different kinds ."
it &apos;s the largest and one of the most important private sector in europe has become in the whole place .
"i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last one you &apos;d like to have on a <unk> ? &quot;"
"he kept his head , no ."
"he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not <unk> ."
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the food .
the <unk> eat the <unk> .
so the <unk> the <unk> the better the system . &quot;
"okay , let &apos;s <unk> the <unk> . a <unk> that don &apos;t <unk> your animals and a <unk> that <unk> your success to your success of health ."
"a <unk> , but also a <unk> ."
"oh , and by the way , they should not be there by the way ."
they &apos;re <unk> in a city of <unk> miles away where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning they fly <unk> miles to the <unk> .
and every night they &apos;re flying <unk> miles away .
they do this because they can follow the white line of the <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
"i &apos;ve been able to imagine a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at <unk> ."
"i said , &quot; <unk> , fly them <unk> miles to the <unk> and fly them back to the evening ?"
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
"he looked at me , as i just had to <unk> a song from whitney ."
"he said , &quot; no . you do it because the food is better . &quot;"
"i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my loved fish that was <unk> , and i don &apos;t like a <unk> . i don &apos;t like her . i don &apos;t like you &apos;re <unk> ."
"it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste ."
i almost never <unk> with that .
"and yet , when i put them in this restaurant in <unk> , they didn &apos;t even have <unk> them after <unk> ."
they <unk> <unk> and <unk> as if you take a <unk> from the ocean .
i mentioned that to <unk> . and he <unk> .
"he said , &quot; the skin <unk> like a <unk> ."
it &apos;s the last <unk> before something in your body .
it &apos;s evolved in the course of evolution to get <unk> up . &quot;
"and then he added , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;"
okay . a <unk> that doesn &apos;t <unk> their fish . a <unk> that <unk> their success to success .
"and then i realized when he says a <unk> , which has no <unk> , he <unk> <unk> , because the water comes from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the river ."
"it &apos;s a river that <unk> all the things that are <unk> from rivers today , and they tend to lead them to , chemical pollutants , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
"and if it <unk> through the system and that <unk> , the water is a clean , as it <unk> ."
"the system is so healthy , it <unk> the water ."
"so not just a <unk> that doesn &apos;t <unk> their animals , not just a <unk> that <unk> their success of health care , but a <unk> that is literally a <unk> , and not just for them , but for me ."
"because when the water <unk> , it <unk> in the atlantic ."
"one drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and they should also do , because these <unk> , as romantic as , is also , <unk> ."
"you might say that you &apos;re a recipe for the good good , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> ."
"what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , in which , actually , <unk> taste ."
"but for many people , it &apos;s a bit too radical ."
"we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re <unk> ."
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about <unk> <unk> . we eat <unk> .
"and when you say that the things that the future <unk> <unk> is to somebody somewhere and says , &quot; hey , people , i love pink , but how are you going to feed the world ?"
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
"no , not because we have enough calories to feed the world more than just to feed ."
a billion people today are <unk> .
"one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> <unk> in the distribution , not the <unk> ."
"now , i don &apos;t like this question because it <unk> the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years ."
"<unk> <unk> , <unk> chemicals on earth , <unk> chemicals on the earth , chicken , and all the time we just asked the <unk> is , &quot; if we feed more people , how <unk> can be ? &quot;"
that was the <unk> . it was the <unk> . it was the <unk> of american agriculture .
"we should call them what she is , a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"this is not a <unk> , and it &apos;s not agriculture ."
"our <unk> <unk> is threatened , not by <unk> , but because of <unk> resources ."
"not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through <unk> land , not by pump , but by fresh water , not by <unk> , but through forests , but by <unk> , not <unk> and <unk> , but through the fish ."
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how do we feed ourselves ?
"or better , how can we do conditions , to provide every community , to feed themselves ?"
"to do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future ."
"it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done ."
"capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> in it , and it never made a really good for food ."
so let &apos;s look at the <unk> model instead .
this is the two billion years of <unk> .
"look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> ."
"businesses , the <unk> of not for worlds , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> instead of just <unk> farmers who are not <unk> , but , experts ."
because they &apos;re the ones that are also experts to taste .
"and when i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better <unk> than i will ever be ."
"you know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is good , it will be <unk> ."
thank you .
"and if i want to share one thing with you today , that the data that we consume is larger than the sum of the parts of it , and instead of <unk> to think of it , i &apos;m going to be able to use information as much as we can , and how we can we can"
so what we see here is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
"it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can <unk> after a particular cause of death , we say <unk> ."
and i immediately see another pattern that makes you .
"and that &apos;s because in the <unk> here , the people who are at the <unk> and they &apos;re over here over the <unk> ."
"we can go out and move the data and see the data , and see that <unk> and cancer <unk> are <unk> , but not for everyone ."
"now , if we go on and look up to age <unk> , we see 40 years or younger , we think that accidents are even the cause of people to worry about ."
"and who &apos;s looking at <unk> , that &apos;s particularly true for men ."
"so you can see that this is a <unk> of information and data in this way , in a very <unk> <unk> ."
"and if we can do this for <unk> , why not it for content itself ?"
what we &apos;ve now here are the <unk> of every single <unk> <unk> that have ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it after my talk to your <unk> .
"with <unk> , they can <unk> in a decade ."
they can be <unk> in a <unk> year .
you can jump to directly at a particular copy .
"now , when i look at this , i see the <unk> that appear in this copy and <unk> ."
"i &apos;m a <unk> armstrong <unk> , so i &apos;m <unk> to show all of my <unk> to show <unk> armstrong ."
"now , if i just want to get a <unk> <unk> , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i &apos;m going to do anything with the subject ? &quot;"
so i go back one step and i <unk> the view .
now i see <unk> <unk> .
"and so you get an idea of that , if you look at this kind of information , you &apos;re <unk> to this kind of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you &apos;re not just looking for , you &apos;re not just <unk> or <unk> ."
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something between and we think it &apos;s the way that information can be used .
i want to do this idea a little bit further with something a little bit crazy .
"what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single <unk> , and we <unk> it down to a little <unk> ."
the <unk> contains a quick <unk> and a symbol for the area that it comes out .
i just &apos;ll just show the top 500 of the <unk> .
"but even in that <unk> , we can do a lot of things ."
and immediately we get a sense of the issues that are at wikipedia <unk> .
i &apos;m going to vote in government now .
"well , after i <unk> government , i &apos;ve <unk> that the <unk> that most <unk> are <unk> people &apos;s &quot; people of the year ."
this is really important because this is a realization that doesn &apos;t exist in one single <unk> .
that &apos;s just to see if you look at a step and look at it .
"so , in particular , one of these <unk> , i can go into the subject of <unk> <unk> &apos;s &quot; to people &apos;s year , &quot; and all of you can see ."
"now , if i look at all these people , i think the majority of them are <unk> , some of the science are coming from science . some of the economy is less coming from the economy . and one comes from the <unk> ."
"and interestingly , bono <unk> a ted <unk> ."
so we can jump and take a look at all the ted <unk> .
"you see , we &apos;re looking at <unk> on the first time it &apos;s actually a network , not just by side , but much more abstract ."
and so i want to show you what a little surprise could be .
i just show you the new york times page .
"<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser but you can look at websites -- and we &apos;ll bring it to each other as any of these <unk> as ."
so i can go back and jump right to a specific <unk> .
so that &apos;s important because you &apos;re just looking at the websites from websites in this way and all the <unk> can look at the same way .
so i can go through my <unk> in a certain <unk> .
here &apos;s the one of the whole demonstration that i &apos;ve been <unk> over here .
and i can look at everything i &apos;ve seen before today .
"and once i look back and look at a step again , i can <unk> my course to go back to my <unk> . here i was looking for <unk> , looking for <unk> , or here , for <unk> live <unk> ."
"and from here , i can go back to the page and i &apos;ll call it back ."
"it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used to be used again , and every time it takes the picture bigger than the sum of the <unk> ."
"right now , in the world , we think that data is a <unk> ."
we talk about the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about the <unk> information .
"what if we could turn that situation and put the internet on the head so that we &apos;re going to go from one to another , from many things to a lot of things , to go to a lot of things , and see what would be <unk> ?"
"if we can do that , then we will <unk> this <unk> , maybe a new source of information ."
"and instead of just moving into information , we can get rid of it ."
"and if we know that we can experience , we can even pull out of it ."
"so i hear with it , thank you very much ."
i grew up with a <unk> portion of <unk> <unk> .
i went to school in my <unk> with the bus every day a hour .
"and my nose always put into a book , a <unk> that my thoughts in other worlds , and <unk> , my way to <unk> my <unk> , <unk> curiosity ."
"this curiosity also turned out that i was always when i was in school , through the forests of <unk> , and i went to <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> all the home ."
"i was totally <unk> , you know ."
it &apos;s always about trying to understand the world and to understand the limits of the possible .
"and my love to <unk> <unk> seemed to be <unk> in my environment , because then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and <unk> the <unk> ."
<unk> <unk> came into our living room with his <unk> that showed us animals and places and a world of <unk> that we &apos;ve never had ever imagined before .
and that &apos;s what i think that &apos;s very well <unk> at the <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
"and there &apos;s no video games that had <unk> to film with <unk> <unk> , and there was no to see all the <unk> in the media landscape , and i had to create the pictures in my head ."
"we had to do that time . when we read a book , we took the description of the description of the <unk> and we put it on our heads in our heads ."
"my reaction to that was drawing and drawing from aliens , <unk> worlds , <unk> , more and so much of it ."
"i was <unk> by the teacher all the time , as i was hidden <unk> , <unk> ."
creativity had to be out .
"and what happened was something interesting about this , which was that i was fascinated by <unk> <unk> , the thought of a completely unknown world here on our earth ."
"i certainly would never get a <unk> world from a <unk> world , and it seemed like i &apos;d been very unlikely ."
"but here was a world i could actually <unk> up here on earth , and it was just as <unk> and <unk> as all of the things i &apos;ve always imagined as i &apos;ve been reading these books ."
so i decided to be 15 when i was 15 .
"the only problem that i lived in a small village in canada , <unk> miles from the ocean ."
i didn &apos;t let myself .
"i <unk> my father until he finally had a <unk> in <unk> , new york , <unk> , <unk> , where we lived on the other side of the border ."
"i made my <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> in the winter of <unk> , new york ."
"but the ocean , a real ocean , i got only two years later on , when we moved to california ."
"since then , in the 40 years now , the <unk> have been <unk> , i spent about 12 hours under water . 500 hours of it in <unk> ."
"and i &apos;ve learned that the world of <unk> , even in the <unk> oceans , as rich in <unk> life , as we can actually possibly imagine ."
"the nature of nature doesn &apos;t know any boundaries , unlike our own , <unk> of human imagination ."
"so , i &apos;m <unk> <unk> <unk> to what i see in my <unk> ."
and my love for the ocean is <unk> with the same intensity as <unk> and the same .
"and when i was being a <unk> , it was the <unk> ."
"that seemed the best way to tell my inner <unk> , to create with my need to create images ."
"when i was a child , i was <unk> <unk> and so on ."
"so films were the way to <unk> pictures and stories , and the <unk> combined ."
"of course , the stories that i was <unk> from the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;"
&quot; <unk> &quot; i could bring my <unk> for <unk> and <unk> with the <unk> .
so my two <unk> <unk> .
"something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> &quot; to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and we had to do a kind of a <unk> <unk> <unk> -- we <unk> on <unk> animation , <unk> on <unk> , <unk> ."
what &apos;s <unk> out was the first <unk> <unk> ever to see in a film .
"the film didn &apos;t have any money , just said , &quot; he just played his <unk> , but i noticed something <unk> : the audience around the world as <unk> from <unk> , who was <unk> ."
"<unk> <unk> &apos;s law is <unk> technology and <unk> , not <unk> to <unk> each other ."
so they saw something <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i found was incredibly <unk> .
"and i thought , &quot; wow , that has to be <unk> in the <unk> . &quot;"
"so we went to &quot; <unk> 2 , &quot; my next film , much further ."
"together , we created the <unk> there , and the guy from liquid metal . the success was <unk> on how this effect would be ."
"and it worked . again , we had a <unk> , and the effect in the audience was the same . we &apos;ve got a little bit more money on the movie ."
"from those two experiences <unk> , a whole new world was achieved , a new world of creativity for creativity ."
"so i started a company , with my good <unk> <unk> <unk> , who was the best <unk> and <unk> at the time , called <unk> ."
the idea of this company was to start to start the <unk> of visual <unk> with visual <unk> and to start with the digital <unk> .
and we also <unk> ourselves for a <unk> <unk> .
"but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that in the &apos; 50s and <unk> -- we actually started <unk> -- we actually started to get slowly <unk> ."
"i had written this piece of avatar called &quot; the <unk> that should <unk> in things and <unk> effects in new <unk> , with <unk> <unk> of human , <unk> , which had been made by <unk> . and the characters that should be the world &apos;s <unk> ."
but the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . and people in my company said that we &apos;re not even able to do that .
"so i <unk> this and i did this new film that big ship , which <unk> ."
"i <unk> this as &quot; darwin and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; in a <unk> , it was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> film ."
but i was actually trying to <unk> the real <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
"but i convinced them by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> . we &apos;re making the real <unk> ."
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the <unk> .
that &apos;s <unk> important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i <unk> them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that &apos;s what it goes back to is that your imagination can create a reality .
"we actually <unk> six months later , a reality that i was in a russian <unk> , four miles below the surface of the surface , and i was looking at the real <unk> through a <unk> ."
"this was not a film , no <unk> , that was real ."
"so , that really <unk> me ."
and the <unk> were enormous . we had to build cameras and <unk> and build everything .
"and i fell like this very <unk> , a <unk> <unk> ."
"well , they were also <unk> and <unk> planning ."
"you go into that <unk> , and you go into this dark , <unk> environment , <unk> , where there &apos;s no hope to save <unk> if you don &apos;t get back ."
"and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s like i was in a <unk> ."
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was obsessed with studying the <unk> .
"anyway , the part of doing curiosity and science has to do . it was all . it was adventure , it was an <unk> ."
and it was a experience that couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
"because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see outside of the <unk> ."
"so , in some of the following <unk> , i &apos;ve seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that had never seen before and the science at the point when we saw them before , when we saw them ."
"so that &apos;s really <unk> me , and i wanted to go back ."
and so i met a very unusual decision .
"after the success of <unk> , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as <unk> in hollywood for a while , and i &apos;ll give it a while . &quot;"
"and then we started , we started the <unk> , and we <unk> them with <unk> ."
we went back to the <unk> of the <unk> .
"we took little robots that we built , and we built a <unk> <unk> ."
"our purpose was , <unk> and <unk> to the inner <unk> of the <unk> , which had never been done before ."
"no one ever had the inside of the <unk> . you had no means to do it , so we developed the <unk> technology ."
"and i &apos;m sitting there , on the deck of the <unk> , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> that these <unk> are pretty similar to me , and from i know that the band has played there ."
and i fly with a little <unk> through the <unk> .
"i &apos;m really <unk> it , but my consciousness is within the <unk> ."
it felt like i was physically in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
"this was the <unk> form of a <unk> i &apos;ve ever <unk> , because before i took a corner of a corner , i always knew what was going on in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , i was months when we went back in the movie ."
and the set was a <unk> copy of the <unk> of the <unk> .
so this was a very strange experience .
"and she made me realize that you use such <unk> to take your own <unk> and your own consciousness into the vehicle , in this other form of existence ."
it was really <unk> <unk> .
"and maybe a little <unk> on what might happen in a few decades , if you have <unk> to do something or to do something , to do in all kinds of <unk> <unk> that i can imagine as a <unk> ."
"and after that <unk> , we started to see what we saw at the bottom there , really , to learn how to do these <unk> , where we saw these incredibly <unk> animals , but we &apos;ve seen this kind of <unk> , on <unk> ."
they &apos;re living with <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight system like we do .
"and so you see animals , the right next to a 500 degrees of <unk> that you can survive there ."
"and i was also very <unk> at the same time , which was again for <unk> , which was the <unk> from my childhood ."
"and so i ended up with the people who are interested in the <unk> and doing the nasa and in the <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> . they &apos;re going to go to russia , and then , and then they &apos;re going to take the international <unk> , and then , and then , and then go"
that was <unk> .
"but at the end , it was going on out that i took <unk> with the <unk> ."
"i took them with them and <unk> them access to the world , <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in this extreme situations , and i took them to <unk> samples and <unk> them to test <unk> and use so on ."
"we were <unk> , but we did actually science , in fact , in a way , say , <unk> ."
"so the circle of my own existence , as a <unk> , when they were in the time , and the effort &apos;s in reality ."
"over the course of these <unk> , i &apos;ve learned a lot of stuff ."
"i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re sure you &apos;re going to have to have a director of the way that a leader is like a <unk> or so ."
but i don &apos;t understand much of <unk> before i <unk> these <unk> .
"because at a certain point i had to say , &quot; what do i actually do ?"
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
"these <unk> movies , they don &apos;t bring money ."
we just play the <unk> . we don &apos;t <unk> .
"all of you , i think , between &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have some <unk> somewhere on a <unk> in the beach ."
"i &apos;ve all made these films , this <unk> , made it for a very small audience ."
"no <unk> , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?"
"you &apos;re doing it to the task , to make the challenge , and the ocean is the <unk> environment , which is the <unk> . you do it because of the <unk> connection , which comes from a group , when a small group of people ."
"because we &apos;ve done this with just 10 to 12 people who have <unk> <unk> , and sometimes we &apos;ve been <unk> , and sometimes we were two to three months in lake ."
"and in that community , you realize that the most important thing is that you have is that you have before each other , because you have a job of <unk> that you can &apos;t explain any other other thing ."
"if you go back to land and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the whole , all the <unk> , the whole technique , and the difficulty , the human <unk> , if you can &apos;t tell them , &quot; what to <unk> ."
"there &apos;s a connection , an <unk> respect ."
"so , when i <unk> to turn my next film &quot; avatar &quot; to turn my next film &quot; , i tried to use the same <unk> , which is that you &apos;re <unk> his team and <unk> themselves in the <unk> ."
and it really changed the dynamic .
"so , i was <unk> with a little team on a <unk> terrain , and we were doing &quot; avatar with a new technology that was still not yet before ."
it &apos;s exciting .
a <unk> challenge .
and we were <unk> for a <unk> period of a <unk> family for a half years .
"and so , it changed my way to make films , completely ."
"there were people who thought we had this <unk> , and we would have <unk> and <unk> on the planet ."
"for me , it was more of a <unk> way to do my job , the actual process that has changed in the outcome ."
so what can we close from all of that ?
what lessons did we learn ?
i think the <unk> is curiosity .
it &apos;s the <unk> human property .
our imagination is a force that can actually create reality .
and the <unk> of your team is more important than all of the <unk> of the world .
"and to me , young <unk> come together , they give me a advice to me about how i can do this ."
"and i say , &quot; don &apos;t <unk> you ."
"and they get some other things for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , bet not against yourself . take risks . &quot;"
nasa has a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> : &quot; <unk> is not an alternative . &quot;
"but in the art and the <unk> , the <unk> has to be an alternative , because there is a <unk> ."
"no major effort , the innovation was <unk> ever <unk> ."
you have to be ready to take these risks .
"that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to give you a little bit of it , and <unk> is an alternative , but not an <unk> . thank you ."
today i &apos;m talking about energy and climate .
and that might be surprised because my <unk> is the foundation of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> the things that we need to make up the poorest two billion lives .
"but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than any other than any of the planet ."
"<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to grow over many years , and we &apos;re going to be too little <unk> . the things will change the way it can &apos;t change their <unk> environment ."
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to <unk> .
"so , a terrible <unk> is going to be <unk> for you ."
and the <unk> is very important for you .
"the fact is that if you could only take one of the price of <unk> , you would be <unk> to the <unk> of the energy from far ."
"well , the <unk> is like a <unk> ."
"in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> ."
"the <unk> was <unk> the industrial revolution and even in the 20th century , there was a <unk> case in the <unk> , and so we <unk> , we can create modern materials and do so many things ."
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation that we &apos;re in the rich world .
"but , if we <unk> the price -- we &apos;ll leave the price down -- we &apos;re going to go down a new barrier and that barrier is to co2 ."
co2 <unk> the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
"they <unk> the <unk> co2 that leads to the <unk> and it has a very negative effects , and effects on the weather and maybe worse , the consequence that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to the natural ecosystems and so on ."
"now , the <unk> relationship between a <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of it , and the other consequences , there &apos;s some <unk> , but not a lot of it ."
and there &apos;s certainly <unk> about how bad these will be . but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
"i asked the <unk> <unk> , &quot; do we really get down to zero ?"
isn &apos;t half or a <unk> ? &quot;
"the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue to move ."
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
"it &apos;s very different than saying , we have a <unk> m <unk> that has to come under a <unk> m , and then you can <unk> it ."
"this has to be down here , down to zero ."
"well , we &apos;re <unk> a lot of <unk> every year , over 26 billion tons of tons ."
"every american is about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one ."
"on average , it &apos;s about five tons for every on the planet ."
and somehow we need to produce changes that go down to zero .
it &apos;s been <unk> .
"only different <unk> change have affected , and we need to grow <unk> increase in <unk> and to <unk> to zero to zero ."
"this equation has four factors . it &apos;s a little bit more <unk> . you have this thing on the left -- co2 that &apos;s going to get zero , and it &apos;s <unk> by the number of people , depending on the average of every single <unk> of the average of the average , every single <unk> ,"
"so let &apos;s look at every factor of <unk> and <unk> , as we get it to zero ."
probably one of these numbers have to come very close to zero .
"now , that &apos;s a fundamental <unk> , but we &apos;re going to go through ."
"first , we have the population ."
"today , <unk> billion people ."
and it <unk> on 9 billion <unk> that are moving on on nine billion .
"if we &apos;re very successful with new <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , we might be able to reduce that by 10 percent to 15 , but at the time we see a <unk> of 1.3 ."
the second factor is the services we use .
"that &apos;s all the food that we eat , clothing , television , <unk> ."
that &apos;s very good things and <unk> means that they &apos;re almost available to every single one on the planet .
"it &apos;s great , that number up ."
"in the rich billion , in the upper billion , we could do <unk> and use <unk> , but average , that number every year , <unk> and <unk> is doubling as far as the number of the services that are available to the individual ."
and here we see a very fundamental service . are there at home so you can read the homework ?
"and these students don &apos;t have them , so they go and read their <unk> under the <unk> ."
"now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news ."
we have something that doesn &apos;t get up .
"because of a lot of <unk> , through other <unk> , through other ways of <unk> , through <unk> , there are many services , and there are many services that are <unk> to reduce 90 percent ."
"in other forms of manufacturing , like <unk> , 65 <unk> -- <unk> : <unk> -- <unk> : <unk> : <unk> or <unk> , or <unk> , is the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> for improvements much ."
"all right , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may have a <unk> factor to be <unk> or maybe even a factor <unk> ."
"but at the first three factors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to maybe <unk> billion <unk> to 13 tons . and that &apos;s just not easy ."
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor of -- and this is going to be a <unk> -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be <unk> per <unk> .
it turns out to be the question that you can get to zero .
"if you burn coal , no ."
"if you burn natural gas , no ."
"almost every <unk> for electricity on co2 is co2 , except renewables and <unk> ."
"so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system ."
we need <unk> .
"now , if i use the term &quot; <unk> , i don &apos;t mean the impossible ."
the <unk> is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the services are a miracle .
people here have contributed to many of these <unk> of <unk> .
"usually , there &apos;s no <unk> that you need to have a miracle to have a certain <unk> ."
"you usually just get next to the next , and some people don &apos;t come ."
"in this case , we have to give <unk> and get a miracle in very short time ."
"now , i was wondering , how could i really <unk> that ?"
"is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that <unk> the idea of the people here ?"
i remembered that last year when i got <unk> and somehow the people liked it .
"the idea was really <unk> for you , you know , that there are people who live with mosquitos ."
"and for energy , i fell here ."
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies would be my <unk> contribution to the environment here .
so here &apos;s some natural fireflies .
"you know , i &apos;m <unk> you don &apos;t bite . you don &apos;t even get the glass off ."
"well , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but they don &apos;t get any ."
"we need solutions , either one or several of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> have <unk> , and even though there are many directions that people look for , i see really only five , that big <unk> can afford ."
"i have <unk> , <unk> , fusion , <unk> ."
"and you may afford a <unk> contribution , and if i &apos;m going to expect better than i would be that , but my <unk> is that we have to work on all five of those five , and we can &apos;t give them any of them <unk> because you all ."
"let &apos;s look at the <unk> <unk> fossil fuels , either <unk> or gas ."
"what you need to do , maybe , but it &apos;s not . you don &apos;t have to get rid of all the co2 that comes from the <unk> , <unk> pressure , pressure and then hope there &apos;s there ."
"there are some <unk> that can do 60 percent , 80 percent , but get 100 percent to 100 percent , it will be very difficult , and a <unk> for the co2 is to a large challenge , but the biggest problem ."
who will make it secure ?
who can <unk> something that literally can have a lot of billion times bigger than any kind of waste you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough <unk> .
next : <unk> .
"it has three big problems , the cost , especially in <unk> countries , the question for security . the question of security is that you can really feel wrong , despite the human <unk> that is not used for fuel weapons ."
and what do you do with the waste ?
"because even though he &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns ."
"so three very difficult problems that might be <unk> , and that &apos;s why you should work on ."
the last three of the five have me <unk> .
it &apos;s the renewables of how often they &apos;re called <unk> .
"and also , even though it &apos;s great , they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some <unk> ."
one is the <unk> that produce dramatically dramatically these technologies that are going to be dramatically dramatically higher than the use of it .
"these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , <unk> more than a normal power power ."
"also , these <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be the same day , and the wind doesn &apos;t seem to be all the time ."
"so you have to <unk> if you &apos;re <unk> from these sources , you have a way that is <unk> energy even when you &apos;re not available ."
"so there are big <unk> here . there are challenges in <unk> . if we say that the energy source is outside the country , they don &apos;t only need to deal with the technology that are <unk> from the energy that is from the way ."
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
"and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve got all kinds of batteries that are made , for cars , cell , <unk> , cell phones , up , and i &apos;ve taken with the amount of electronic energy that i &apos;ve used to use them to use the same energy ."
"so we need a big <unk> here , something that will be 100 better than the <unk> are ."
"that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy ."
that happens when you try to try and get these <unk> sources over to say about 20 percent of the <unk> .
"if you want to have about 100 percent on that , you need an incredible <unk> ."
"now , where should we go , what &apos;s the right approach ?"
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds of companies are .
"in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people ."
"many of you &apos;ll say , these are crazy ! that &apos;s good ."
i think there are many of the ted group here that already have been involved in .
"bill &apos;s big for several companies , under other than a <unk> , the great <unk> has <unk> ."
<unk> <unk> : in dozens of companies that make great things and interesting opportunities and i &apos;m trying to support .
"nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that may be able to <unk> , the <unk> approach ."
there are some innovations in <unk> ; it &apos;s <unk> .
"and the development of this industry has stopped in this industry some time ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that there &apos;s some good concepts ."
"the <unk> means that instead of a part of the <unk> , which is a percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the 99 ."
this is a pretty crazy idea .
"but in fact , you had been thinking about it long , but you couldn &apos;t make <unk> whether it would work , yet there &apos;s modern <unk> , you can simulate it and see that it &apos;s on , right , it looks like the right , it &apos;s seen ."
"and because you &apos;re <unk> these 99 percent of them , the <unk> is very much better ."
"in fact , you <unk> the waste , and you can actually use the waste of today as <unk> ."
"instead of <unk> the head , they just burn it . a great thing ."
"so , the uranium dioxide is used to grow <unk> , a little bit like a <unk> ."
"you see it &apos;s a kind of <unk> <unk> , often called the <unk> wave of reactor ."
that really <unk> the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in <unk> .
"this is the waste , the 99 percent . you &apos;ve <unk> the part that &apos;s <unk> today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium ."
the green <unk> the <unk> for hundreds of years .
"and if you &apos;re <unk> cheap and you just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the planet &apos;s <unk> ."
"you know , there &apos;s lots of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many <unk> of <unk> that we need to come forward ."
we &apos;re going to <unk> how to measure our success .
what should our look like to them ?
"well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to do , and then we talk about the <unk> ."
many of them are talking about 80 percent of the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
"the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still , and it will be an agriculture . hopefully , it will be <unk> , and hopefully be clean ."
"so , to get that 80 percent , you have to get the <unk> , <unk> countries like china , their <unk> completely <unk> ."
"the other note is , if we use the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest ."
that &apos;s great .
this will be a <unk> of this <unk> .
"if we go back from there , what should we look like by 2020 ?"
it should be able to contain the two elements .
"we should use the <unk> to get <unk> on the way , the less we <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> the <unk> and the temperature is too much ."
"but actually , this note is the things that we do , that we don &apos;t lead to the big <unk> , just to just the same , or even less important , the other one that is the <unk> of innovation for these <unk> ."
"we need to track these <unk> and we can measure it with <unk> , and <unk> , in <unk> , and <unk> ."
there &apos;s a lot of great books about that topic .
"the <unk> al gore , &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> <unk> the air . &quot;"
"they really go through and create a frame where this can be talked about , because we need for all sides ."
there &apos;s a lot of things that needs to come together .
this is a wish .
a very <unk> wish that we invent this technology .
"if you just wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i could choose that would choose , or i could choose that , or i could not choose , that <unk> co2 will be a <unk> wish ."
this has the biggest impact .
"if we don &apos;t get that wish to be <unk> between the <unk> and <unk> people in the past , between the united states and china , between the poor and the poor , and almost every two billion of these two will be much more bad ."
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do for doing ?
we need to use more <unk> for more <unk> .
"if countries meet in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 ."
"they should talk about these <unk> and they would be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , who are spent <unk> , <unk> , to these <unk> ."
"we need <unk> , <unk> co2 , <unk> , center , trade a <unk> ."
we need to spread the news .
we need to have a conversation and <unk> and also to get things that the government will happen .
"it &apos;s a important wish , but i think we can meet it ."
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
"thank you very much . just to understand <unk> -- <unk> , can you give us an idea of the <unk> of this investment ?"
"bill gates : to do the simulation on a <unk> , to get all the big scientist what we did , we only need a few 10 million . and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in the russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s effective ."
"the hard step is to create the first <unk> , finding another billion , the <unk> and the place in fact that the first one is building ."
"once the first one is done , when it &apos;s done as <unk> , it &apos;s all clear because the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> is so different as we know them ."
"to understand that , that means to build deep down into the floor as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then the <unk> <unk> starts to go and starts to move forward and go down to the bottom ?"
"<unk> : right now . today you &apos;ve got to <unk> the reactor up , so there &apos;s a lot of people and lots of <unk> that can go wrong . this thing you can open and <unk> stuff , or <unk> , it &apos;s not good ."
"but if you have very cheap fuel , you can <unk> it for 60 years -- think of it a <unk> -- you can <unk> it without the <unk> ."
and it &apos;s in there and it &apos;s <unk> 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
"a nuclear <unk> , which <unk> a solution for waste ."
"<unk> : yes . now , what happens to the waste : you can sit down -- there &apos;s a lot less <unk> with this method -- then you take it and burn it in the next reactor and burn it ."
"and we start by taking the waste that &apos;s already already in these <unk> or <unk> , and that &apos;s our <unk> ."
so what &apos;s been a problem for these <unk> is a problem that we put in our <unk> and will be reduced to the <unk> during this process .
"but while they were talking to about different people in the world , they talked about this possibilities ."
where is the biggest interest in what really do ?
"<unk> : now we haven &apos;t <unk> a place , and there &apos;s a lot of more interesting <unk> for everything called <unk> . there &apos;s big interest in the <unk> and people of the <unk> in russia , and what i &apos;ve been in china , i &apos;ve been in china ."
"i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have made something in the direction ."
this is a <unk> of one thing that was done .
"this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a fast reactor and some countries have built these , so each one that has a quick quick reactor , a <unk> for our first ."
"in their imagination , <unk> and <unk> , something that really <unk> to live ?"
"<unk> : well , we need one of these <unk> , <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have spent 20 years to <unk> and then use 20 years ."
this is the kind of <unk> that <unk> us the <unk> that we have to <unk> .
"and , you know , <unk> , if everything is going to do well , and that &apos;s a big wish that could be easy ."
"and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of companies that work , just as if their <unk> work , the <unk> of the <unk> for their <unk> can work ."
"and it would be the best if it can create multiple , because then you could use a mixture ."
we need a solution to that .
"<unk> &apos;s big <unk> , this is the biggest one that you know ?"
<unk> : a <unk> is the <unk> .
"that would have been the <unk> without the <unk> , but it &apos;s much more important ."
"in <unk> <unk> , there are other innovative companies ."
"you know , we don &apos;t know what their work is so good for , but there &apos;s the <unk> method that &apos;s a different approach ."
"there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that seems to be a difficult , but maybe it &apos;s a little bit about us ."
"and so there are different , but the nice thing about that a <unk> of times has a million times as much energy , we say , a <unk> and so , if you can deal with the problems and the resources that the footprint and the power , and the co2 , and the co2 increases the most"
"if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?"
do we need to <unk> <unk> to try to keep the <unk> <unk> ?
"<unk> : if you get into this situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve got too much food , and shortly before a heart attack , what do you need ? you might need a <unk> or something ."
"there &apos;s a research that &apos;s called <unk> , which is <unk> with different techniques to <unk> the warming to <unk> the global or 30 years to make us <unk> ."
that &apos;s just one <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
"some people say , you shouldn &apos;t work at the time , because maybe you &apos;re going to do it , so you &apos;re going to keep a <unk> , because you know that one will save the <unk> ."
"i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you &apos;re going to <unk> the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a <unk> in <unk> to whether you have the available to things , or if we need to get more innovation or more than that , it is longer , i don &apos;t know ,"
<unk> : do you have one or two <unk> for those who might convince you ?
"<unk> : well , unfortunately , the <unk> live in very different <unk> ."
the scientific <unk> of arguments are very little .
tell them that there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds ?
"there are very , very few things that you can actually tell , from which there is a chance of a million ."
the <unk> here is as similar to aids .
"you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later ."
"and so the idea , now , if you have all kinds of problems , to invest in something that you have just later -- and that investment is not so clear , and in fact , is the essence of the ipcc report , and that &apos;s the biggest contribution ."
the fact is that this uncertainty is supposed to worry about us .
"but my dream here is that if you can do it <unk> , and at the same time you get the carbon out , then the <unk> : &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t make me <unk> , but i &apos;ll just make it <unk> it so much ."
"and that would be the answer to the <unk> <unk> argument that if you use all of these time and energy to solve co2 , all the other goals , the <unk> of the <unk> that is so much more money , and that &apos;s so stupid , that it would be better , and that it would be"
"<unk> : well , the actual research on the research -- let &apos;s say that the <unk> should spend 10 billion billion a year more than you today do -- that &apos;s not so dramatic ."
it &apos;s not supposed to be suffering from other things .
"you get too big <unk> , and here you can have <unk> people , if you have something that &apos;s not <unk> , and try to fund it , for me , for me , most of the <unk> ."
"it &apos;s because , you &apos;re very short before a <unk> and funded to fund the <unk> , and i think we should try to do things that have a lot more or less than much less ."
"if you can get the <unk> that you get , which is a very high school , then only can the rich keep ."
"i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much as much of our energy without changing our lifestyle ."
"but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster ."
and even <unk> thinks about it .
"his new <unk> is now , &quot; why don &apos;t research research be <unk> ? &quot;"
"he &apos;s still being associated with his former stories , but he &apos;s got to understand , he &apos;s understood that that &apos;s a very rare group and so he &apos;s going to take the <unk> ."
and this is a <unk> that i think is <unk> .
"the research , it &apos;s just crazy to be <unk> ."
"bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost for all people here , if i say , i really hope that your wish is true . thank you very much ."
<unk> : thank you .
"a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> put a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;"
"the idea is quite simple . <unk> have to <unk> the <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , about <unk> <unk> <unk> , build a <unk> of <unk> and a <unk> ."
the <unk> must be on top .
"and , even though it seems really easy , it &apos;s actually really hard because it &apos;s getting people to work very quickly ."
"and so i thought that &apos;s an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> ."
it was a great success .
"i &apos;ve done about 70 <unk> in the world , with students , <unk> and architects , even with <unk> , and there &apos;s something about this task , which is a depth of the <unk> that allows you to share with you some of them ."
usually most people start to <unk> about the task of doing this .
"they talk about what they &apos;re going to look like , they &apos;re going to be <unk> ."
"then they invest a little time in planning and organization , and they <unk> and put together in <unk> ."
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> structures all the time .
"and finally , just before you have no time , somebody takes the <unk> and you put it on the top , you put it back to the top , you get a step back and you know , &quot; <unk> your work ."
"but what happens is , almost always , that &apos;s what the &quot; <unk> &quot; is going to be a &quot; <unk> &quot; because the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> is that the whole thing <unk> , and <unk> ."
"there &apos;s a series of people who have much more <unk> than others , and under the worst , the <unk> are fresh ."
"they lie , they <unk> , they &apos;re confused , and they really make <unk> shapes ."
"and of course , there are teams who have a lot more &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , and they have a lot of the best new <unk> of <unk> ."
and that &apos;s quite amazing .
"as peter told us , they don &apos;t only produce the highest towers , they were the most interesting structures of all ."
"what you might ask them is , how does this come ? what ? what about ?"
and peter <unk> : &quot; no one of the kids spend time in it <unk> <unk> . &quot;
they don &apos;t spend time in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
"and that &apos;s that <unk> have been trained to find the right plan , ok ."
and then to realize it .
"what happens when you put the <unk> on the top , you don &apos;t have a time and what happens ?"
it &apos;s a crisis .
"sounds familiar , what ?"
"what <unk> different is they &apos;re starting with the <unk> and build prototypes , they &apos;re always building prototypes , <unk> prototypes , always with the <unk> , so that they have the possibility of <unk> to repair <unk> prototypes ."
"<unk> , this kind of collaboration as a <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"and with each attempt to get the kids directly feedback , which doesn &apos;t work ."
"so the performance is to work with prototypes , a lot of time -- but we see how <unk> teams are <unk> ."
"the average of most of the people is about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the half of them , lawyers do something more , but not much more than adults ."
who is the most successful ?
"architects and architects and engineers , for happiness ."
<unk> is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand <unk> and <unk> <unk> patterns are the key to build stable structures .
"<unk> are something about average , but here &apos;s what &apos;s going to be interesting ."
"you put a <unk> on the team , you &apos;ll get <unk> better ."
it &apos;s incredible . you see and you see &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is this ?
because they have special skills .
"they <unk> the process , they understand it ."
"and this team , the <unk> and the work , is <unk> the performance of teams to improve ."
<unk> skills and <unk> and their combination lead to success .
"if you have 10 teams , the typical <unk> <unk> , you get about six , the stable structures ."
i tried a little bit .
i thought we &apos;ll get the <unk> .
so i offered a <unk> $ <unk> for the <unk> .
what do you think about these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
"if <unk> had built high construction , it would have <unk> home ."
so isn &apos;t interesting that high <unk> have a strong effect ?
we <unk> this practice with the same students .
what do they think about it ?
now she understood the advantage of the <unk> .
"so , for the same , bad team of one ."
they produced the highest construction at the least time .
so there are <unk> lessons for us to be <unk> about nature and success .
you may ask : why would somebody actually invest time to create a <unk> ?
"the reason is , i create <unk> digital tools and <unk> to help teams , cars , video games and <unk> <unk> ."
and what the <unk> does is it helps you identify hidden <unk> .
"because , frankly , every project has its own <unk> ."
"the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or <unk> , to build the right <unk> ."
"and this is the value of the experience , this kind of simple exercise ."
"and those of you who are interested in , can go to <unk> ."
it &apos;s a blog where you see the ones that they &apos;re building .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
"they find crazy examples of all the world , like people <unk> the system and <unk> ."
there are <unk> .
"and the <unk> lesson , i think , is that the construction sport is actually a <unk> sport ."
"it requires that we all <unk> our senses to the task , and we use our thinking about how our feelings and our own , in the challenge , which is in the challenge that we are ."
and sometimes a little <unk> of this experience is all that it needs to bring us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to bring to a <unk> .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s do it as we had a machine .
"a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a time machine ."
and everyone in this room has to get in .
"and you can go into the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and stay here and now ."
"and i ask myself what you &apos;re going to vote because i &apos;ve asked my friends in the last time a question , and they wanted to go all the time ."
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before they were cars or twitter or &quot; america <unk> the <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re somehow <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i understand that .
"i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say ."
"i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a <unk> ."
"it &apos;s because opportunities don &apos;t go back to this planet , they go ahead ."
"so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future ."
"this is the most important time that there was ever on this planet , whatever scale you &apos;re going to do , health , mobility , opportunities , <unk> , <unk> ."
there was never a time of time like this .
my <unk> died all the died as 60 .
my grandparents were <unk> these number in <unk> .
my parents are the 80 in the <unk> .
so there should be better at the beginning of my <unk> .
"but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that ."
"a child who can be born today in <unk> , is expecting to live as long as the <unk> man on the world for 100 years ago ."
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve <unk> the demographics in the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we <unk> them . <unk> .
"in the rich world , the millions of diseases that have only been threatened by one generation , hardly yet ."
"<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ..."
do anybody even know what that is ?
"<unk> , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that are the <unk> of scientific method ."
"and from my view , the scientific method of <unk> , looking at things , whether it works , it works if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the most <unk> of humanity ."
so that &apos;s the good news .
"unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;re often mentioned ."
"and one of them is that despite all of our <unk> , a billion people in the world go to bed every day ."
"this number goes up , and it goes up very fast , and that &apos;s <unk> ."
"and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to <unk> the world ."
"<unk> land , <unk> land , oil , oil , gas , they go away , and they &apos;re all going to go out and , if we don &apos;t go out of this chaos , we &apos;re also going to disappear ."
so the question is : can we do it ? i think we &apos;ve got it .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country to live on their lives .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t <unk> them at the same time .
"i really think that , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> ."
"but this is <unk> me at night -- one of the things that are awake at night , and we &apos;re still <unk> scientific progress in the same way that we never have ."
"and we &apos;ve never been able to make it <unk> , as we can today ."
"we &apos;re on the threshold of <unk> , and i think that we really have hundreds of areas , we need hundreds of years ago to go back to the <unk> , to find a time we have more <unk> in the <unk> of the things that we have ."
"people are <unk> in their faith , and so closely , that you can &apos;t <unk> them ."
not even the truth will <unk> them .
"and listen , everyone has a right to his mind , even a fairly <unk> to its progress ."
but do you know what they don &apos;t have ?
"they &apos;re not a right in their own facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t have it ."
and i took a while to find out that .
"about a decade ago , i wrote an article about <unk> for &quot; the new york &quot; writing , a little article ."
and i was <unk> to <unk> resistance to the resistance to what is the most effective <unk> in the end of humanity &apos;s health care in the history of humanity .
"i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did , so i just did , i wrote a paper and went on ."
and i was going to write a article about <unk> <unk> .
"the same thing , just bigger ."
people were playing crazy .
"so i &apos;ve also written a article about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that this was &quot; <unk> &quot; why they believed in a certain way instead of a <unk> kind of a <unk> kind of nature in the area of nature ."
"but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept doing ."
"i mean , i &apos;m journalist ."
"we <unk> , we rich , we eat , we &apos;re okay , that &apos;s okay ."
"but i was doing this article , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it out ."
and that &apos;s because these <unk> <unk> that were <unk> me at all <unk> .
"these were <unk> people , <unk> people , <unk> people ."
they were just like the people in this room .
and that brought me all the <unk> ...
"but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest ."
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship with progress .
we talk about <unk> .
"we &apos;re talking about <unk> , with little <unk> about this : &quot; progress . &quot;"
"okay , for that , there &apos;s reasons , and i think that &apos;s what the reasons are ."
"we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , lost to itself , and there &apos;s no reason why that &apos;s not going to be ."
you can just call some names and people will understand .
"<unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> 2000 ."
"i mean , you can choose your own list ."
there are questions and problems of people that we thought they were always . so they were skeptical .
"ask the question , ask you to have evidence , desire ."
don &apos;t give you anything like that .
"but it comes out now : if you have to get the evidence , you have to get this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it ."
"and i can say that from the reason we &apos;re in a <unk> of life , as i &apos;ve never seen it , and hopefully hopefully , i &apos;ll never see again ."
"about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ."
very <unk> .
<unk> studies were done by seeing if this was right .
<unk> studies should be done . this is a serious issue .
the data came in .
"the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , not <unk> , not connection , no connection , no connection ."
"it doesn &apos;t make difference . it doesn &apos;t make a difference because we believe in <unk> , we believe what we see to see what we do , what makes us feel real ."
"we don &apos;t think of a <unk> of data that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we &apos;re all doing ."
but do you know what ?
the result of that was <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : the united states is one of the world in which the world &apos;s <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happened is that we could do that .
"well , i understand that . i do that ."
because does anybody have that ?
has a <unk> in the audience ever seen anybody dying ?
not happening very often .
"in this country , not even , but <unk> , in the world over the last year ."
"that &apos;s a lot of death in <unk> , 20 hour ."
"but because that &apos;s not happening here , we can <unk> it , and people like jenny can <unk> and messages of fear and <unk> from platforms like <unk> and king <unk> and king <unk> ."
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect and <unk> .
"they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same ."
"and this is something that we need to learn , very quickly ."
"this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> ."
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
"no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , disappeared ."
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s just developed a <unk> with a couple of other people .
"it can save the lives of <unk> , <unk> children a year in the developing world ."
"pretty good , not ?"
"now , that &apos;s good , apart from paul &apos;s that paul talks and talks about <unk> and says how valuable you are , and people should stop <unk> ."
and that &apos;s actually what he says .
so paul is a terrorist .
"if paul &apos;s in a public <unk> , he can &apos;t tell the <unk> <unk> ."
it gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where their children go to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
"i don &apos;t need that , but <unk> are <unk> ."
"you &apos;re going to take them , <unk> the diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening right now ."
we now have <unk> in this country now .
"and that &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because that &apos;s just one question of the numbers ."
and they &apos;re not just going to die of <unk> .
what about <unk> ? do we take that . why not ?
"a <unk> of mine wrote a few weeks ago , and i said , &quot; i believe i &apos;m a little bit too <unk> ."
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t <unk> her child against <unk> . no case .
<unk> .
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have a <unk> in this country yesterday .
"today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody &apos;s morning in lagos , and he &apos;s going to go to los angeles right now , right now , he &apos;s over <unk> ."
"and in a few hours , he <unk> and he &apos;s a car , and he comes to <unk> <unk> , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these <unk> <unk> tonight ."
"and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know it too , because the world is going to work now ."
that &apos;s the planet we live on . they don &apos;t do as if it &apos;s not .
we love it to lie to us in lie . we love that .
did you have taken your <unk> tomorrow every morning ?
"<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you to do with the <unk> ."
i know they did this because half of americans do that every day .
"they take that stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make a difference , as often we find them to be useless ."
the data is constantly <unk> .
they make their <unk> . they &apos;re almost never doing .
"this is okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark numbers ."
i &apos;ll give you a whole thing .
dark <unk> . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do it ?
now i think i understand -- we hate the <unk> .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we should not do that . our healthcare system is <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing and <unk> ourselves to make sure that it can afford .
"so we &apos;re going to go away , and where are we going ?"
we &apos;re going to the poor arms .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
"but you know , that &apos;s really serious about because the stuff is <unk> , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars for it ."
and i have all kinds of little <unk> here .
"<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t know what it is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s <unk> ."
"and you know what ? when i say , people <unk> me and say , &quot; what do you do ? people do you do ."
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
"because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> saying , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to not be the <unk> of my experts to <unk> or any <unk> <unk> to treat his patients with <unk> ."
"if you <unk> to that way , where do and <unk> <unk> and science and science , you get to a place you don &apos;t want to be ."
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
"he brought <unk> to his people because he was <unk> that red , <unk> and <unk> are much more <unk> than <unk> drugs , we know that they can <unk> the course of aids ."
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that will be worse than any other of these disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have any consequences .
they have . they have .
"now , the <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re in the world is this <unk> <unk> between the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> ."
this is a <unk> debate . it &apos;s got to stop .
"it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors ."
"that &apos;s ideology , not science ."
"everything we eat , every <unk> , every branch , every <unk> , every <unk> , has changed by people ."
"you know , there was no <unk> in paradise ."
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did it all .
we &apos;ve done it in the last few years .
"and <unk> of it has not worked , and doesn &apos;t work ."
"we &apos;re <unk> , which doesn &apos;t work ."
"now we can do it more , and of course we can do risks , but we can do something like <unk> a <unk> , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , their lives , to <unk> them ."
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
"i have to say , i don &apos;t understand ."
we <unk> <unk> food .
why do we do that ?
"now , what i &apos;m hearing is a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to be huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong ."
we don &apos;t want companies to live <unk> .
we don &apos;t want companies that companies have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all that is ?
"yes , they &apos;re right . we &apos;re <unk> it ."
"it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science ."
it &apos;s not something to do with science .
"it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> ."
"you know , science is not a company ."
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
"it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes , but the idea that we should not allow the science to do is to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> million people from <unk> ."
"you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to have 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent ."
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
"they need that , and we don &apos;t give them ."
and why ? <unk> food .
we don &apos;t want people to eat this <unk> stuff like <unk> .
<unk> is something that <unk> half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s about how it &apos;s a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s <unk> .
"it has no <unk> , it has no protein , and scientists build all of that ."
and then people could eat the food and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
"they wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , and you know what ?"
"that &apos;s what beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful ."
and all i can tell to this is : why do we <unk> this ?
"i mean , let &apos;s ask us , why do we do that ?"
because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes ?
"it &apos;s not about genes , it &apos;s not about chemicals . it &apos;s not about chemicals ."
"it &apos;s not about our <unk> passion for hormones , our <unk> , better food , better food , food food ."
"it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people living at life , and it &apos;s going to be highest time to understand what that means ."
because do you know what ?
"if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so much like we do so far as we do something that we think we think we don &apos;t want to be <unk> , <unk> ."
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on .
"it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s not our <unk> , and we really have to stop it ."
"so after that incredibly <unk> conversation , you might want to say , &quot; do you still want to go into this <unk> time and go to the future ? &quot;"
anyway . i want to do that in any case .
"and at the moment , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity ."
we can put this time on time to do anything that we want .
"we can <unk> them where we want them to go , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want to go ."
"we have to take these <unk> , and we need to think , but if we go to the machine machine and go into the future , we &apos;ll be happy to have done that ."
"i know that we can , and it &apos;s <unk> to me , it &apos;s something that needs now in the world ."
thank you .
thank you .
"and i &apos;ve been interested in the <unk> , and it may seem as strange that a <unk> is interested in what it is like i think of as a , &quot; a deception that will only believe in a little bit , &quot; if somebody else is a little ."
"in other words , <unk> have shown in some studies of a <unk> effect , the <unk> effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks that it &apos;s what happens to you is a <unk> or a <unk> , just a <unk> , in the body , for example , when you , when you can give it"
"a deception will be something real , because somebody <unk> it ."
"so we also understand each other , i want to show you a <unk> , very simple <unk> ."
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s been at least <unk> for the 1950s in every <unk> for children .
i even learned it from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;ll do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;m going to <unk> it .
"so , look at what happens ."
"the knife you can study it , my hand that you can study ."
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife as well .
i <unk> my <unk> back .
"and to make sure that nothing is going to go out of my <unk> , or out of it , i just will just <unk> my wrist here right here ."
"in this way , you can see that there &apos;s no time moving at any time . as long as i can &apos;t go in my <unk> or <unk> <unk> ."
and the goal is quite easy .
"i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully everything goes well , the knife will <unk> through my own physical <unk> ."
"it &apos;s actually in the fact that it &apos;s so <unk> that i can shake , without the knife , the knife ."
"nothing <unk> into my <unk> or comes out , not a <unk> , and you can study everything ."
<unk> !
"now , this is a trick that i often <unk> small children who are interested in <unk> , because you can learn much about deception , if you &apos;re in a very <unk> , it &apos;s a very simple trick ."
probably many of you here know this trick in this trick .
it works like this .
i &apos;m holding the knife .
"i say i <unk> my wrist to make sure that nothing <unk> is out of my <unk> or out of the <unk> , and that &apos;s a <unk> ."
the reason i <unk> my wrist is that the real secret of illusion is .
"and the moment where i <unk> my hand from you to see her , moving this finger here , my <unk> , just <unk> from where he was , in a position he was so <unk> ."
cool trick ?
there was somebody sitting there who had no childhood .
"so , it &apos;s in here . right ."
"and if i look at <unk> , the fingers changes his position ."
"and now you could talk about why this is an illusion that you don &apos;t see here at the bottom is just three fingers : because the mind and the way it works , it doesn &apos;t see them three , it &apos;s two , two , two ."
but that &apos;s not really about it here . and then i open my hand .
"of course it &apos;s <unk> there , but not through the <unk> of my body , but by a trick , through my <unk> , which is there now ."
"and if i close my hand , the same thing that happens by <unk> me , through that movement , the fingers <unk> back again ."
i take this hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick is to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
"now , what does that have to do with the <unk> ?"
"i was in a year or so , i was reading a study that actually <unk> me ."
"i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and that &apos;s why i was an amazing thing ."
"and this is what <unk> does , and it &apos;s what <unk> do when you offer a <unk> in the form of a <unk> pill , which is just a round , a white pill , a certain effect ."
"but if you change the shape that you <unk> the <unk> , for example , in a smaller pill , and the blue <unk> and the letters is <unk> , it &apos;s actually <unk> ."
"and that , even though , no one of them -- they &apos;re just <unk> ."
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? i really <unk> it .
it turned out that this is not all .
"if you take <unk> , the <unk> is still <unk> than each one ."
"a <unk> <unk> <unk> that &apos;s in the end and on the other red , is better than a white <unk> ."
the <unk> <unk> also plays a role .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact exact exact same statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
"but the <unk> is , right ?"
that &apos;s the <unk> also play a role .
and the shape plays a role .
"and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to get to the needle ."
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you could bring to a patient .
it creates a very <unk> image in your head . it &apos;s very much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a <unk> device .
"so the fact is that the white pill is not as good as the blue pill that the blue pill , that don &apos;t <unk> as well as a <unk> that doesn &apos;t <unk> as well as the needle ."
"and nothing that really has some <unk> . it &apos;s just our faith that <unk> into us , <unk> ."
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a <unk> .
"i take something that &apos;s obvious to deception , and let &apos;s look look at it ."
we know that in this study that you have to get your needle if it &apos;s to go to the point .
"this is an 18 inches long <unk> . it &apos;s very , very , very <unk> . and i &apos;m going to take a little bit of a <unk> ."
this is my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a <unk> from hollywood .
"i &apos;m going to take this needle into my skin and go through through them , until they <unk> on the other side ."
"if you &apos;re <unk> -- if you &apos;re easy to fall in <unk> -- i &apos;ve <unk> some last friends in <unk> , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and i didn &apos;t know that &apos;s a woman to come to you ."
"so i &apos;m going to <unk> you out a quick <unk> , then look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what i &apos;m going to do the first <unk> part here ."
"you can see it in the same way , but you can also <unk> if you want to ."
"so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my meat starts , at the bottom of my <unk> i &apos;m going to just make a little <unk> ."
do i &apos;m really sorry . does it <unk> ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other .
now we &apos;re in the same situation that we had at the <unk> .
about .
"but now , can &apos;t you count my fingers , right ?"
"so , i &apos;ll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five ."
"well , that &apos;s ."
i know what people think when they see that .
"they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so <unk> and <unk> itself to just <unk> for us for a few minutes . &quot;"
"well , i &apos;ll show it ."
what does this look like ? pretty well .
"yeah , i know ."
"and people say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;"
people in the <unk> come in now .
let me show you it close to the area .
this is really my skin . this is not a <unk> of hollywood .
"this is my meat , and i can do the <unk> ."
"sorry . when you &apos;re <unk> , look away , don &apos;t look at them ."
"people or the back , which will eventually look at video at some time , and they &apos;ll say , &quot; well , it &apos;s pretty <unk> , but if it was really , it would look , it &apos;s really , and it &apos;s a hole there ."
"okay , let me just take a little blood for you ."
"yes , here it is ."
i would usually <unk> the needle .
i would show my arm <unk> and show you that there &apos;s no <unk> .
"but i think in this <unk> here and with the purpose of being able to make a real thing , i &apos;m just going to just leave the needle in and go out and so on the stage ."
we &apos;ll be able to meet a couple of days in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re going to be happy . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
"i have given some people the number of books that have been published with <unk> in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there was a lot more ."
there &apos;s a massive wave of <unk> to happiness .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people <unk> .
"but despite all of these <unk> work , there are multiple cognitive <unk> that are kind of <unk> to think about happiness ."
and my talk today is going to be mostly of these cognitive <unk> .
"the <unk> is <unk> , thinking about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because <unk> that we are as <unk> as any other one ."
the first of these are <unk> to <unk> complexity is <unk> .
"it turns out that the word &quot; happiness is just not a useful word , &quot; because we &apos;re using it to many different things ."
"i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could just <unk> , but in the big and all of that , that &apos;s something that we need to give up , and we need to <unk> the <unk> view of view of what well-being is ."
"the second case is a <unk> of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s between his life and happy to be in his life , or happy with his life ."
"and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the idea of happiness ."
"and the third is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the most important fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that well-being is happening without <unk> its importance ."
"i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive event ."
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
"now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a <unk> after one of my <unk> , who said one story . &quot; he said , he had a <unk> , and it was absolutely beautiful <unk> , and it was a <unk> music <unk> ."
"and then he added , really emotionally , which has <unk> all the experience ."
but that didn &apos;t have .
what it had been <unk> was the <unk> of experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of music .
"they didn &apos;t know because he was <unk> with a memory , and the memory was <unk> , and the memory was everything that he had had to get ."
what &apos;s really saying is that we might think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of self .
"there &apos;s a <unk> self that &apos;s in the present and the present , able to experience the past is , but in fact , has the present moment ."
"it &apos;s the <unk> self , the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it now , if i put it on here ? &quot;"
"and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> itself is the <unk> and the story of our lives are <unk> , and it &apos;s the doctor that <unk> the question , &quot; how do you feel at the moment ? &quot;"
"or , &quot; how did your journey to <unk> ? &quot; or something like that ."
"these are two different <unk> that <unk> <unk> and the <unk> themselves , and the two to be part of the <unk> of happiness ."
"now , the <unk> itself is a <unk> ."
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our <unk> response -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we tell ourselves about telling stories .
"our memory tells us stories , which means that we can keep from our <unk> is a story ."
and let &apos;s start with <unk> for example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who are <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
"i &apos;m not going to go into the detail . it &apos;s not anymore , but she was painful , but she was <unk> as this one was done in the <unk> ."
they were asked to tell every 60 seconds of their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
"and they &apos;re going to ask , &quot; who has more <unk> ? &quot;"
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
"patient b has clearly more <unk> . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a a <unk> b , and more ."
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients thought that they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient has a much worse <unk> on the <unk> of the patient as a patient <unk> .
"the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very <unk> part of the story is how they end ."
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is that clear ...
but one of them is far worse than the other .
and the one that was worse is where the pain was at the end of its peak at its peak . it &apos;s a very bad story .
how do we know that ?
"because we asked these people to their <unk> , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was all the whole thing ? &quot;"
and she was much worse than a <unk> in the <unk> .
"well , this is a <unk> conflict between the <unk> itself and the <unk> itself ."
"from the <unk> self , <unk> <unk> had a worse time ."
"well , what you could do with the patient , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> to a <unk> <unk> , without <unk> ."
"it &apos;s going to lead that the patient is suffering , but it &apos;s a little bit less than a before ."
"and if you make that for a few minutes you &apos;ve done that the <unk> itself is a <unk> a <unk> , and you do it that the <unk> itself is a <unk> of patient as a much better experience , because you &apos;ve got a better experience ."
<unk> <unk> is a story ?
"and that &apos;s true for the stories that <unk> the memory , and it &apos;s true for the stories that we invent ."
"<unk> a story of <unk> are <unk> and <unk> , <unk> moments and end ."
"end , very , very important , and in this case , <unk> <unk> ."
"now , the <unk> self is <unk> alive ."
"it has moments of <unk> , one after another ."
"and you ask , what happens with these <unk> ?"
and the answer is really easy . they &apos;re lost forever .
"i mean , most of our lives , most of our lives -- and i have the <unk> -- you know , the <unk> <unk> for about three seconds . what means , you know , it has been in a <unk> of you a million of them ."
most of them are completely <unk> from the <unk> themselves .
and they somehow get the impression that they should count what happens during those moments of life .
it &apos;s the limited resource we &apos;re using in this world .
"and how we would be more important to them , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> self ."
"so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> itself , and they &apos;re really pretty <unk> ."
the biggest difference between them is the <unk> time .
"the <unk> self , if you have a <unk> and the second week is just as good as the first one , the <unk> <unk> is twice as well as the <unk> <unk> ."
this is not how much it works for the <unk> itself .
"the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , has no better than the <unk> <unk> , because there &apos;s no new <unk> <unk> ."
they don &apos;t have changed the story .
"and in that way , the critical <unk> is actually the critical <unk> that <unk> itself from a <unk> self itself . time has very little impact on this story ."
"now , the <unk> itself makes more than to remember and telling stories ."
"it &apos;s actually what makes the decisions , because if you have a patient , who , say two <unk> in two different surgeons , and <unk> , which is that he &apos;s chosen , that he &apos;s less the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , that &apos;s not the <unk> that is the fat ."
the <unk> itself doesn &apos;t have a voice in that choice .
we don &apos;t actually choose between <unk> . we choose between <unk> .
"and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about our future as a <unk> ."
we think about our future as a <unk> <unk> .
"and basically , you can see this , you know , as a piece of <unk> itself , and you can think of the <unk> itself as one that <unk> the <unk> itself through experiences that doesn &apos;t need to take <unk> even ."
"i have the impression that if we have <unk> that &apos;s very often the case , which is , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> in the service of the <unk> itself ."
"and that &apos;s a little bit hard to think , i think ."
"i mean , how much do we <unk> from our <unk> ?"
this is one of the <unk> that is given to the <unk> of the self .
"and if i think about it , i think , i &apos;ve been on a <unk> that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in antarctica , which is clearly the best <unk> i &apos;ve ever had , and i think often <unk> about it as much as i do ."
"and i probably have my <unk> journey to this <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes for the last four years ."
"now , if i had the <unk> <unk> with 600 images in it i had spent another hour ."
"now , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s <unk> and a half hours ."
there seems to be a <unk> .
"now , i like a little bit <unk> , you know how little i &apos;ve been doing the <unk> of <unk> , but even if you &apos;re doing more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why are we going to give you a lot more <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>"
so i want you to think about a thought of thought experiment .
"imagine your next <unk> , you know , at the end of the <unk> , all of the <unk> are being <unk> , and you get a <unk> drug so you &apos;re going to remember nothing ."
"now , would you vote for the same one ?"
"and if you had a <unk> , you have a conflict between the two species of self and you have to think about how you decide that conflict , and that &apos;s really not even though you could get a sense of the answer ."
why we choose the <unk> that we choose to pick up is a problem that gives us a choice between the two ways of self .
"now , those two kinds of people who are <unk> to happiness ."
"there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one one per <unk> ."
"so you can ask , how happy is the <unk> itself ?"
and then you would ask : how are the moments of life in the <unk> itself ?
"and they &apos;re all -- very complicated for times , a bit more complicated process ."
what are the emotions that can be used to ?
"and by the way , we &apos;re now <unk> to get a pretty good idea of happiness themselves from the time ."
"if you ask yourself to the happiness , it &apos;s a very different thing ."
this is not what happy lives .
it &apos;s about how <unk> or <unk> the person is when they think about their life .
very <unk> term .
"everybody who &apos;s not being <unk> different from happiness , and i &apos;m <unk> to a lot of <unk> about well-being in well-being that &apos;s exploration of happiness for the same time ."
"the <unk> between the <unk> self and the <unk> of the <unk> itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re <unk> to measure the two <unk> ."
"the <unk> <unk> <unk> has been a world of <unk> , where there were more than a million people who have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their lives , and there were other efforts in the direction ."
"so in the last year , we started learning about the <unk> of the two species themselves ."
and the main lesson that we think is that they &apos;re really different .
"you can know how somebody is happy with his life , and the <unk> they really don &apos;t care about how happy he lives and <unk> ."
"just to give you a sense of <unk> that &apos;s <unk> , which is about <unk> ."
"what does that mean is that if you were going to meet someone and you would say , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about his size ?"
"well , you &apos;d know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty ."
they have so much uncertainty .
"if i tell you that somebody has his lives as eight of 10 <unk> , they have much of how happy it is to be with its <unk> ."
so the <unk> is low .
we know something about the <unk> of the <unk> .
"we know that money is very important , goals are very important ."
we know that happiness is mainly to be satisfied with people that we like time to spend time with people that we like .
"there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s <unk> ."
"so if you &apos;re lucky to be the two species of self , you &apos;re going to do very different things at the end of the end ."
the <unk> of what i &apos;ve said here is that we should be lucky to think of happiness as a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
"well , very short , another reason we can &apos;t really think about happiness is that we &apos;re not paying attention to the same things that we think about life , and if we actually live ."
"so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to be the <unk> answer ."
"if you ask this question , you think that people in california have to be <unk> in california when they say , we live in <unk> ."
"and what happens is that when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , on climate ."
"now , it turns out that climate is not very important for <unk> itself , and it &apos;s not very important to the <unk> itself , as happy as happy people are ."
"but now , because the <unk> is responsible for itself , you can go back to the end of some people at the end of california ."
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who are going to pull california to come to hope .
"well , your <unk> self will not be <unk> ."
we know that .
"but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re <unk> because if you &apos;re going to think about it , it was <unk> about how terrible the weather was in <unk> . and they &apos;re going to feel that they made the real decision ."
"it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope to you , i hope you have a sense of how difficult it is ."
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
"well , when we took a couple of weeks ago , i told them to me that there was a pretty interesting result that this <unk> came from the <unk> survey ."
"is that something that you can get to share with us , because now you have a few minutes ?"
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most amazing thing we found in the <unk> survey is a number that we didn &apos;t find absolutely <unk> .
we found that in terms of happiness .
if we can <unk> how feelings <unk> with income .
"and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars in the year of americans , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of <unk> , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a great <unk> sample of 100 percent per year in 100,000 ."
"60,000 ."
"<unk> : 60,000 ."
"60,000 dollars in the year are people unhappy , and they become increasingly <unk> , the more <unk> they become ."
we get a absolutely <unk> line .
"i mean , i &apos;ve seen <unk> <unk> ."
"what happens is obviously that money doesn &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> , but that lack of money is <unk> for a <unk> , and we can measure this <unk> very , very clearly ."
"in the sense of the other self , the <unk> self , you get another story ."
the more money you make is <unk> .
it &apos;s not true for emotion .
"but danny , in the entire american <unk> , it &apos;s about life , freedom to <unk> ."
"if people were taking this test seriously , i mean , it seems to be able to put everything on your head , all we think , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on ."
"is there a chance that politicians that politicians in general would take a place like the <unk> , and would be going to do based on politics ?"
"<unk> : you know , i think there &apos;s a <unk> for the role of <unk> in politics ."
"the <unk> will be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , she &apos;s going to happen and in other countries ."
"people are aware of that , if you think about happiness , if you think about politics ."
"it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to explore or want to explore <unk> , so we need to take this discussion pretty soon ."
"how you can <unk> increase in very different ways , how you think and think about the <unk> itself or whether you think about the <unk> itself ."
"the politics is going to influence , i think , in the <unk> years ."
"in the united states , you have to measure the <unk> of the population ."
"that &apos;s what i think , in the next or two decades , is going to be the national <unk> ."
"now , it seems to me , this topic , or at least the <unk> political debate will be on the next few years ."
thank you very much for the invention of the <unk> .
"thank you , danny <unk> ."
i &apos;m jane <unk> . i &apos;m <unk> .
"i &apos;ve been working for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it just easy to save the world in reality , as to save them in <unk> ."
"i have a plan for this . i want to convince you to do more people , including everybody , spend more time with the game more <unk> and more <unk> games ."
we &apos;re currently spending three billion hours a week of <unk> .
"some of you might think , &quot; that &apos;s a whole lot of time for games . &quot;"
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
"but in fact , my research on the <unk> for the future , is that the opposite is what it is ."
three billion hours a week is not enough to solve the <unk> problems of the world .
"in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that time ."
i &apos;ve been <unk> that the time has been <unk> at 21 billion hours a week .
"that may seem to be a <unk> , so i <unk> it to be , if we do problems like hunger , climate change , global warming , global warming and <unk> , i think we need to play , for at least online billion years on the same age ."
"no , i &apos;m really serious ."
"why ? why this image is quite <unk> , why i think games are so important for the survival of the human species in the future . seriously ."
this is a <unk> of photographers .
"he wanted to <unk> the feelings of playing , so he built a camera in front of the <unk> ."
this is one of the classic expressions of games .
"if you &apos;re not a player , you might be able to get some of the <unk> in this picture ."
"you probably see this <unk> of urgency , something fear , but also <unk> concentration , <unk> in a really difficult problem ."
"and as you do , you see some <unk> here , which are <unk> up to the top of the <unk> eyes and the mouth of optimism . the <unk> show was surprising to surprise ."
this is a player who &apos;s at the <unk> of a <unk> called <unk> .
"oh , you know that . ok . so <unk> . so we have some players here ."
a <unk> victory is a result that is so <unk> positive that you didn &apos;t know that it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
"and if you do it , they &apos;re <unk> to actually be able to do something like that . that &apos;s a <unk> ."
this player is a very short <unk> of victory .
"and this is what we have to see millions of faces in the world , if we &apos;re going to take the <unk> of the next century , and the face of all the face of the face of a <unk> <unk> ."
"<unk> , unfortunately , we &apos;re more likely to see this face in real life , when we &apos;re dealing with difficult problems ."
"i <unk> it as as &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad &quot; <unk> . &quot; and it &apos;s my face , you see ? ok ."
"that &apos;s me , i &apos;m like , &quot; i &apos;m living &quot; i &apos;m doing bad . &quot;"
"this is a graffiti in my <unk> home in berkeley , california , where i was looking at my <unk> , and why we were better in games better than in real life ."
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think that we &apos;re not as good as playing .
"and i don &apos;t mean just less successful , even though that &apos;s the one ."
"we &apos;re going to do more in <unk> . i &apos;m doing a good thing in the context of motivation to do something , inspired by collaboration ."
"if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i think that many of us are going to turn into our best version , at any time , to try to solve the problem , <unk> the problem , try to try to try and try again to the <unk> ."
"and in reality , when we fail , when we <unk> , we feel different ."
"we feel overwhelmed . we feel rational . we feel about depressed , maybe depressed , <unk> or <unk> ."
"we never have the feelings when we play games , they just don &apos;t ."
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a <unk> .
"why is it impossible to think , to think , you could not just reach anything ?"
how can we <unk> these feelings of the games in reality ?
"so i looked at games like the world of <unk> , which <unk> the ideal environment for <unk> ."
and i &apos;ve noticed some things that are <unk> <unk> won &apos;t do so much .
"so , first of all , if you &apos;re going to <unk> in one of these online online , especially in world of <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are ready to be ready to give you a <unk> mission , right now ."
"but not just any mission , but it &apos;s a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?"
so do you do that .
they never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
"but always at the edge of your skills , so you have to <unk> yourself , but there &apos;s no <unk> in the world of <unk> ."
you &apos;re not around and you &apos;re <unk> . there &apos;s always something very important to do .
and there &apos;s <unk> employees .
"where they go , hundreds of people who work with them to work with their <unk> mission ."
"we don &apos;t have that in real life that just as easy , that feeling with a <unk> <unk> of employees ."
"and there &apos;s also this <unk> story , that <unk> story , why we &apos;re there and what we have to do ."
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve <unk> from &quot; level up &quot; and &quot; <unk> + &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> intelligence . &quot;
that <unk> feedback is not in the true life .
"if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> idea , 20 crazy idea ."
i don &apos;t get the feedback in real life .
"so the problem of <unk> like world is that it &apos;s so <unk> to be , at any time , at the <unk> of a <unk> , that we would rather spend our time in these <unk> ."
they &apos;re just better than reality .
"now , all the world of <unk> have spent millions of years with <unk> the virtual problems of <unk> ."
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound <unk> .
"but to see in the context of this , <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> started to go upright ."
so the first <unk> <unk> .
"ok , so , if we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently playing with play , it makes just sense when you &apos;re going to be in terms of the human mind that &apos;s worth of a <unk> ."
"but also , <unk> . because it turns out that we use all the time on playing this whole time , we actually change what people are in the way ."
"we &apos;re developing <unk> , so much , <unk> ."
that &apos;s the truth . i think about it .
"and you see this interesting statistics that was published recently by a researcher <unk> university in <unk> university : the average boy of the country in a country of 10,000 <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> hours to <unk> ."
"so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number , for two reasons ."
"first of all , for kids in the united states , they are <unk> hours of time that they spend time in school , from the fifth grade to the high school , when you never have any <unk> ."
"so we &apos;ve got a complete <unk> here , looking at the young people as learning what it means to be a good player , how everything else they learn in school ."
"and maybe some of them have read the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> ."
"so you know , the theory of the <unk> , the theory of the <unk> of 10,000 hours ."
"it &apos;s based on the great research that <unk> , if we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> of any <unk> <unk> to the 21st century , we will be <unk> at <unk> ."
we &apos;re going to do so well in doing whatever the world is in the world .
"so what we have here is a whole generation of young people , who are <unk> ."
"so the big question is , &quot; what are the players ? &quot;"
"because if we could find that , we would have never been able to have a <unk> human potential ."
"so many people have in the world currently , who spend at least an hour a day with <unk> ."
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are so good in &quot; something . &quot;
"and the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinary in whatever ."
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
"the <unk> developed <unk> , saving energy and working on <unk> , rather than <unk> , so that they can play around the world , especially in india , brazil , can play online ."
you would expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
and that we have <unk> billion <unk> .
so i started to <unk> what it is to do with these games .
here &apos;s the four things i found . first : <unk> .
"ok , imagine the <unk> <unk> ."
"<unk> is the desire to do something , to get a <unk> , to <unk> with the belief that we have a <unk> hope to success ."
"players are always thinking that a <unk> is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to try and do it right ."
players are not sitting around .
players are <unk> <unk> <unk> social <unk> .
"there &apos;s a lot more interesting research that shows people we like to have more , after we played with them , even when they &apos;ve <unk> us <unk> ."
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust with someone to play a game .
"we trust that someone &apos;s time to us with a time that the rules will be <unk> , that we have the same goal and to stay there ."
"so the <unk> allows the <unk> to grow , trust and with each other ."
"as a result , we &apos;re building more powerful social relationships ."
<unk> <unk> . fantastic !
"you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours of a week , at least a time ."
"the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually <unk> to work hard when we &apos;re doing <unk> or nothing ."
"we know that we work as human beings when we do hard , important work ."
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
"and finally , <unk> meaning ."
players love to be able to be <unk> of <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
"here &apos;s a data that &apos;s going to the right thing to do , and you know all wikipedia , the biggest <unk> of the world ."
the <unk> <unk> of the world with almost <unk> <unk> is the world of <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about world &apos;s internet <unk> than any other subject in the world &apos;s world &apos;s worth of <unk> .
they &apos;re creating a <unk> story .
they create a <unk> source of knowledge about the world of <unk> .
"ok , so that &apos;s four <unk> that lead to one outcome , players are <unk> , <unk> individuals ."
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
"and the only problem is they think they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real thing ."
this is the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is <unk> . he studied why people spend so much time and money in <unk> .
"and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to get less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;"
and that &apos;s from an economist . so he &apos;s <unk> .
and he says ...
"not like me , i play <unk> , i &apos;m a <unk> ."
"so he says that actually makes sense , because the players can get more to the <unk> than the real life ."
"they can play more complex social <unk> than real lives , and they get more <unk> and more <unk> in play than in real life ."
so he says it &apos;s completely <unk> that players spend more time in the virtual world than in real time .
"i just want to give you that , that &apos;s <unk> ."
but it &apos;s definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that <unk> years .
"there &apos;s this <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> . you know ?"
"before that <unk> <unk> , there was <unk> ."
and that was kind of the first people of <unk> <unk> .
"and if you &apos;re familiar with the ancient greek <unk> <unk> , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented ."
"<unk> <unk> , they were <unk> , <unk> , in the kingdom , in the <unk> <unk> ."
it was supposed to be a great <unk> that the king of <unk> decided to get a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people <unk> .
it was a <unk> situation . you needed a <unk> solution .
"so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> were a <unk> strategy . a day you would eat food . the next day you would play ."
"and they would be so <unk> to the <unk> , because they &apos;re so <unk> , and with <unk> , <unk> <unk> , they would be <unk> to eat nothing ."
"and then , the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat ."
"and according to <unk> , they <unk> this <unk> for 18 years by playing on a day and played the next day ."
"so , i think we &apos;re going to play today ."
we &apos;re doing games to <unk> the real world &apos;s suffering .
"we &apos;re playing a game to <unk> everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , especially the real life is <unk> , and we &apos;re going to take away from what we need to play ."
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
this is the <unk> .
"according to 18 years , the <unk> didn &apos;t get better at the <unk> . so the king decided that the last <unk> was a <unk> ."
they shared the kingdom in two <unk> .
"they played a <unk> , and the best were able to <unk> an <unk> adventure ."
"they left <unk> and they were looking for a new home , and they just left it so many people , as they were <unk> to survive , and they had the rest of the area where they were able to <unk> them ."
"this sounds crazy , right ?"
"but <unk> <unk> show that the <unk> that later <unk> the <unk> <unk> , the same dna as the old <unk> ."
"so scientists came to the notion of this , that <unk> &apos;s crazy story actually ."
and <unk> evidence that gives a global <unk> that almost 20 years could explain what the <unk> might explain .
"so , this crazy story could be ."
"you may actually have saved your people through play , by <unk> for 18 years , and then they had <unk> these <unk> and so much about the same thing that they learned from the civilization ."
"so , we can ."
we &apos;ve been playing since 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real time in the world of <unk> . it was 16 years ago .
"they were playing 18 years for <unk> , we &apos;ve been playing for about 16 years ."
i say we &apos;re ready to have their own <unk> .
"so , they sent half the civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion <unk> per week ."
we should <unk> that half of us have to have a day with games for a day until we have solved the problems of the real world .
"i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world ? &quot; and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve got my work in the last couple of years on the future for planning ."
"we have this <unk> <unk> in our office in <unk> , <unk> the way we should understand the future ."
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
what we want to do is to create the future .
"we want to think of the best outcome , and then people are <unk> to make this sense of understanding ."
we &apos;re giving <unk> won <unk> and giving people people to achieve them .
i &apos;m just showing you three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to get people <unk> in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> that you have to overcome a <unk> .
"the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> to do it for realistic , and actually their real life without oil . so if they <unk> to the game , they say they &apos;re <unk> , they get better to live , and they get better <unk> ."
"we &apos;ve been tested with this game with <unk> <unk> in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been with it since the last three years ."
and i can tell you that it was a changing experience .
"nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should ."
"but when you &apos;re in an <unk> adventure and you say , &quot; we &apos;re going to take out of oil . &quot;"
this is a <unk> adventure that you &apos;re going to go .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have <unk> the game <unk> .
so we have a bigger game for the next time to the <unk> goal of <unk> to the <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; <unk> &quot; at the <unk> for the future .
<unk> is the <unk> of a <unk> that people have only <unk> years on the planet .
"this is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , &quot; of course ."
"the call of the player , <unk> , we &apos;ve <unk> the <unk> <unk> ."
"you know <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s the &quot; <unk> &quot; -- you have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , the <unk> , and only can be able to save the world ."
"but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , every one is in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our task , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice ."
"8,000 <unk> played the game for eight weeks ."
they found 500 creative solutions that they can <unk> when they <unk> &quot; <unk> .
"and the last game is that we get out on three , march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank ."
"and when you end the game , you get from the world bank <unk> , &quot; social <unk> , in 2010 ."
we &apos;re working with universities in the entire sub-saharan africa and store them to learn a social <unk> .
"we have a <unk> . we have a level of level to understand , <unk> , sustainability , <unk> and <unk> ."
"i want to invite you all to share with young people all over the world , all around the world , in <unk> , who benefit from each other to <unk> their own social <unk> ."
i &apos;ll go to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
"we have all of these <unk> players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet ."
"<unk> , i hope you agree that the players are human resources that we can use to live in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change ."
"we have all these <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the ability to <unk> social <unk> , <unk> and <unk> the importance of <unk> ."
i really hope that we play <unk> games to survive another century .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me like this and play .
"when i come to the next decade , i &apos;m sure that we can make every <unk> future , and we can play all kinds of games ."
"so i say , let &apos;s start the <unk> games !"
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something that i &apos;ve been given to write a few months ago in writing a article for <unk> .
"i always <unk> my <unk> <unk> , but i was done with the <unk> of the <unk> , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never looked in my life , which really <unk> the word &quot; really <unk> . &quot;"
i read them the <unk> .
"&quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,"
"<unk> : healthy , strong , <unk> . &quot;"
"i read this list of a friend <unk> , and i had to laugh , she was so ridiculous , but i just got to <unk> , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t read to read and read and read me <unk> after that <unk> <unk> and the emotional <unk> ."
"of course , that was a <unk> , old <unk> . i just thought that the copy has to be pretty old ."
"but in fact , it was a <unk> on the early &apos; 80s , when i was just starting with elementary school and started building my <unk> outside outside my <unk> environment and form in other children , also around me around me ."
and god is thank you for the time .
"i would take that <unk> seriously , if i was born into a world that someone could perceive me as a person who could be a <unk> in a <unk> way , but i &apos;ll have the opportunity and adventure that i &apos;ve seen ."
"so i immediately <unk> the <unk> of 2009 , and i expected to find a <unk> <unk> ."
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
don &apos;t get them much better .
"and in particular , the last two words , i &apos;m <unk> under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;"
but it &apos;s not just the words .
it &apos;s what we think about the people we think we &apos;re going to describe with these <unk> .
"it &apos;s about the values that put in these words , and how we build these values ."
"our language affects our thinking , and how we can see the world and the people around us ."
"many <unk> societies , including the <unk> and the <unk> , have really believed that the <unk> of a big force has given a big force , because what you &apos;re <unk> out of it , is <unk> ."
"so , what do we want to do is we want to do -- a <unk> people or a <unk> person ?"
"even a <unk> person to call people as a child , could be able to <unk> and <unk> them ."
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open doors ?
a human being opened up for me was to <unk> my <unk> on <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
"he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name they think they can &apos;t think that most americans couldn &apos;t be <unk> . so he always called dr. <unk> ."
and dr. <unk> had always sat very <unk> and was for the work with kids just like .
i found the time i spent time in this hospital just great -- until my <unk> <unk> .
"i had to <unk> individual <unk> often with these <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- you know that they built my <unk> , and i have this <unk> <unk> more than anything , and i <unk> them ."
"and imagine , i &apos;ve got a <unk> kid with dr. <unk> , and so tried to stop this <unk> without success ."
"and he <unk> me by one day -- these <unk> were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so <unk> , <unk> and young girls , and a young girl , you will become one day ."
"and if you <unk> it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;"
"that was , of course , just a simple trick from dr. <unk> , so i &apos;m going to make the <unk> that i didn &apos;t want to do with the chance that <unk> girl in the <unk> girl in the second , and he actually brought me a new <unk> ."
"and i ask myself , as much as his vision of me as a <unk> and <unk> young girls have shaped my <unk> and i could imagine myself as a <unk> of nature and <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"this is just an example of many of you , as adults can be <unk> with a child &apos;s imagination ."
"but as the <unk> examples of the <unk> , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine what we all wish would be : to make each of us to see as <unk> as <unk> people ."
our language <unk> the social changes that were <unk> in many cases by a technological change .
"from medical standpoint , you can say that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , from titan , <unk> for titan and <unk> to allow people to actually <unk> their own , and to <unk> their own opportunities to <unk> the diet of their own <unk> and the limits ."
"so perhaps this technological change is clearly clear that there was always another truth , that every human being can give a very <unk> and very <unk> and very <unk> can be able to <unk> human ability , to <unk> our biggest <unk> ."
"the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people are always asking me to tell me how to do with <unk> and i &apos;m going to tell you something that sentence is never , and i &apos;m really feeling the way i &apos;m feeling very , and i &apos;m really so <unk> for people"
"this one sentence of <unk> lives with the idea of being <unk> that happiness or happiness depends on a challenge , without being <unk> by the <unk> experience , and as if my life was so successful , or i could <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> of a life ."
"but the truth is that we change ourselves . of course , we are shaped by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , not emotionally or even both ."
and i claim that that &apos;s good .
<unk> are not a <unk> that we need to <unk> to come up with our lives better .
<unk> are just at our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> as my shadow .
"sometimes i realize it &apos;s very <unk> , sometimes it &apos;s hardly to see , but it &apos;s constantly all around me ."
"and i want to <unk> the impact , or the <unk> of the human <unk> of a human <unk> ."
"it &apos;s <unk> in life , and challenges that are only real and any person is going to go different about it , but the question is not to get to whether we get <unk> or not , but we can get to how we get it ."
"so we &apos;re not just responsible for people that we love to keep <unk> , but they &apos;re also ready to get ready to get good at all right ."
and we don &apos;t even know our kids if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
"you have to separate two things out : to be the medical fact , to be a <unk> and to the other <unk> that i think is <unk> or not ."
"and to be honest , the only real and <unk> <unk> i had to put apart with is that the world is constantly <unk> to me with these definitions ."
"in our desire , people who are <unk> to us , and they are <unk> to the most difficult truth of their <unk> , or even a <unk> <unk> of the quality of life , that they should have to be <unk> in that they don &apos;t be <unk> ."
"maybe the <unk> concept that is just <unk> to what &apos;s broken in one <unk> , and how we fix the <unk> , for every single one of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> ."
"if we treat a human being <unk> , and not <unk> all its forces and possibilities and <unk> , we create <unk> to the natural <unk> that may have to lead to a more disease ."
we have a human beings who &apos;s worth a value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the <unk> and focus on all of the possibilities of human possibilities .
"but the <unk> is that between the perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> , there is a connection ."
"we should not <unk> these important times as well as <unk> , we should not try to avoid them , we should be able to <unk> them under the <unk> , but it &apos;s about the <unk> opportunity ."
"i may be more likely to realize that we don &apos;t have to overcome <unk> , but we &apos;re open to it up to <unk> them , to <unk> them to even use a <unk> and perhaps even use it ."
"and maybe we can do it , as a <unk> , <unk> and make some useful and feel so that through your <unk> <unk> doesn &apos;t make so much more ."
"in this year , we celebrate the 200 , charles darwin , and as he wrote about 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , has a very true place in my mind ."
"i would use it as a <unk> , not the <unk> of its kind , and also not the <unk> of its kind , but the <unk> can adapt to the best ."
we create creativity .
"not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive , to survive and to survive , from the <unk> of the human <unk> is to <unk> conflict ."
"so again , change and <unk> , the <unk> of human skills are the <unk> ."
and maybe we just know what wood we &apos;re going to be when we &apos;re really <unk> .
"perhaps the point of <unk> , a sense of the <unk> of the time , a feeling for our own force ."
we can give ourselves a little bit .
we can make a new meaning that goes beyond the difficult times .
maybe we can see <unk> as change .
<unk> are <unk> for a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we have <unk> ourselves is to believe we should be normal .
"so , you know , who &apos;s normal ?"
there &apos;s no normal .
"there &apos;s the <unk> . the typical . but not the normal . and would you know these poor , <unk> person really want to know if they really were ?"
i think it &apos;s not that way .
"it would be great if we could <unk> this paradigm of the <unk> against another , or the strength , to even get a little bit more dangerous , so we could <unk> the forces of many children and <unk> their own , and they would <unk> their <unk> their <unk> ."
"<unk> found out that we have people who have always been <unk> by society to become a <unk> , to be useful and to afford to afford a contribution ."
"there &apos;s evidence that the <unk> <unk> people have <unk> older people and people with severe <unk> <unk> and may have happened , and perhaps because the experience of the battle in the battle of this society was in society ."
they didn &apos;t look like these people and <unk> ; they were considered something special and <unk> .
"a few years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in a <unk> in the <unk> zone in the <unk> of <unk> , and i was standing there in a <unk> <unk> ."
it was summer and i had <unk> .
"and i hear a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not <unk> . &quot;"
and i &apos;m <unk> about and seeing this older man . i had no idea who he was .
"and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , do we know ? i can &apos;t remember it . &quot;"
"and he said , &quot; well , you know , hardly remember me ."
"when i first saw her , i <unk> her <unk> her mother . &quot;"
"oh , so that &apos;s the one ."
"and of course , it &apos;s done <unk> ."
"this was dr. <unk> , a man i knew just from narratives from my mother , because i , of course , <unk> to my birthday was two to two weeks ."
"the doctor &apos;s <unk> <unk> my mother was on <unk> , and so my parents had taken me to the world , who actually didn &apos;t ."
"and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet were <unk> to you and just have a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he was the <unk> , the <unk> , the bad news that had to be <unk> ."
"he said to me , &quot; i had to tell you your parents that you would never go , and never be so <unk> , like other kids , or you never have a <unk> life , and have been <unk> . &quot;"
"i really found that he &apos;s been <unk> by all my childhood <unk> , doesn &apos;t matter if i had a <unk> in the second grade , i had <unk> with the <unk> in the <unk> of the student , and he didn &apos;t care about when he was a farmer , i was a <unk> , he was"
and he called this part of his <unk> that x <unk> the potential of human <unk> .
you can &apos;t just <unk> enough to think of how important that factor for the quality of a human life .
"and dr. <unk> told her , he said , &quot; i learned that children , if they don &apos;t get anything else , and even if they get a little bit of support , if you can do a kids , you can get a lot of <unk> . &quot;"
"you see , dr. <unk> has changed his mind ."
"he had understood that medical diagnosis , and as somebody else being able to do that , two different things ."
"and i &apos;ve also changed my thinking over time when you would have asked me at the age of 15 , if i had <unk> my <unk> to legs from meat and bones , i would have no second ."
i wanted to actually be the normal normal one .
"if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure ."
"and that &apos;s what happens , because i have something that i &apos;ve had a <unk> with my legs and not despite those <unk> ."
"and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;m so many people who open doors to me , rather than to meet people that i wanted to be a <unk> or a <unk> ."
"you see , it really needs to only one people to <unk> you , how you can <unk> your forces , and you &apos;re from ."
"if you give someone to your own , <unk> forces , your mind is so <unk> , if you can do that , and you open for somebody in a critical moment , you &apos;re open up for those people ."
they bring them up to open up and open doors .
the real meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means that something that is in one way that the potential is to <unk> .
"again , what potential do we want to <unk> ?"
"in the <unk> years , in britain , one case , was done in <unk> . they were turned into <unk> ."
"they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call it as &quot; <unk> . &quot;"
students are <unk> to <unk> .
"and the one is <unk> to <unk> <unk> , get better teachers and so forth ."
they have <unk> over a <unk> period of students with a &quot; <unk> &quot; the grade &quot; very good . &quot; it was said that they were very smart . and after that three months they &apos;ve written it .
"and of course , it <unk> the heart that <unk> was told that they were told that they were just enough ."
and it was also after three months .
but just those who are still in school -- except from the students who had <unk> school .
the key thing in this study was that the teachers weren &apos;t <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
"they were just told that they were <unk> and that students are the <unk> . they &apos;re enough , and they &apos;ve taught them something and they &apos;re taught to treat them ."
"the only real <unk> is a little bit of a mind that &apos;s broken , no hope has got more hope . it &apos;s not <unk> to our natural , <unk> <unk> and <unk> our ability to <unk> ."
"but if we can support the human mind to support the human mind , to keep to hope and to be <unk> around and to find other people around and <unk> , then we &apos;re going to really be able to make our forces ."
"if a mind has that qualities , we can create a new and new <unk> ."
"i want to end with a poem that was <unk> by a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> century , and told me my friend <unk> <unk> . and the word &quot; god , &quot; he &apos;s just no word , &quot; she knows the girl , &quot; she doesn &apos;t know every child ."
"come , dance with me . thank you ."
how would you want to be better than you are at the moment ?
"so imagine i said that through a lot of the changes of your genes , a better memory could have -- more , more and faster and faster ."
"or or want to <unk> , more of the power , more power ."
do you want to be <unk> and <unk> ?
how would it be longer to live in good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who are always <unk> to more creativity .
what would you like to do most ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see you .
a couple . probably about how much people there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would make a good memory ?
some more .
how about <unk> ?
a couple less .
what about longevity ?
"ah , the majority . i like to do that as a doctor ."
"if you could only have one of them , it would be a different world ."
is it all just <unk> ?
or is it possible ?
"evolution is a <unk> <unk> subject on the <unk> , but i want to give you the <unk> of a <unk> ."
"the great <unk> in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian <unk> church , once wrote a paper called &quot; nothing in biology is not a sense of evolution in the <unk> evolution of evolution . &quot;"
"now , if you &apos;re one of those that don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , that would be a very good time , your <unk> , you give your personal <unk> -- i &apos;ll give you the <unk> , and maybe give you a <unk> , and you a <unk> ."
"but if you accept evolution , remember this one : is it just about the past , or is it also about the future ?"
"is it for other <unk> , or is it <unk> us ?"
this is another view of life .
"in this image , i have a <unk> as a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the <unk> of the tree of life , all the existing <unk> on the <unk> of these <unk> had been in <unk> , and their own success ."
"the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in ."
we <unk> from a shared <unk> ancestors of modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
"in that time , there may be 20 or 25 different <unk> of <unk> ."
some have come and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
"it seems to be like we &apos;re quite <unk> from the other parts of the <unk> of life , but actually in the greatest part , the most fundamental <unk> of our cells are quite equal ."
"so what we can use is that we can use it from it , and the <unk> of a common <unk> can produce the protein of the human <unk> to produce the human <unk> that &apos;s used to treat <unk> ?"
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s <unk> by what &apos;s coming from the <unk> .
"and in fact , what we &apos;re talking about bacteria is that every one of us in our gut makes more bacteria than the cells in our own body ?"
maybe 10 times <unk> .
"i mean , think if <unk> <unk> asked for your <unk> , do you think about the bacteria ?"
our gut is a wonderful environment for these bacteria .
"it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very <unk> ."
and you &apos;re going to be all <unk> to give you all the <unk> that you might have to do without effort .
"it &apos;s really a easier way to get bacteria , with <unk> <unk> of questions , forced to <unk> to <unk> ."
"but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they are important for their lives ."
"they help <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and they protect them against certain diseases ."
but what will come in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> in a species ?
or are we certainly going to be something else -- something that might be even better adapted to the environment ?
"so let &apos;s take a step back in the time of the big <unk> years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about about four billion years ago , perhaps , three years ago , on the earth , so far as far as earth , the earth , the earth , the earth <unk> , we"
"in this huge <unk> of the universe , the life on earth is just <unk> to <unk> ; the animal kingdom , like a single <unk> , and the human life , a small <unk> ."
we were .
"this also <unk> the <unk> of this speech , so i hope d <unk> it ."
"now , when i was a <unk> at college , i had my first <unk> ."
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
"i <unk> into the power of evolution , and i <unk> something very <unk> : most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , <unk> every cell cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to continue to continue to <unk> ."
"but at the time , when <unk> organisms were <unk> , they started changing things ."
sexual <unk> is <unk> .
"and the important thing is , with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the genome <unk> , will <unk> the rest of the body ."
"in fact , you could say that the <unk> of the body of the body in the same moment is <unk> as the sexual <unk> as the sexual <unk> ."
"now i have to <unk> when i was a <unk> , i thought , sex / aids , sex , death of sex , death -- it seemed quite <unk> to the moment , but with every year , it &apos;s been <unk> for more <unk> ."
"i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george <unk> <unk> , who <unk> his show in the &apos; 90s in the &apos; 90s ."
"and one night , there &apos;s a <unk> on his <unk> ."
he opens the door .
he &apos;s a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
"she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;"
"&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;"
"i came to the realization of the physician that i was <unk> to the <unk> of the goal of evolution -- not <unk> , not just different ."
i &apos;ve tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to <unk> health to the disease .
i wanted to make a long and <unk> life .
"evolution is all over the <unk> of the genome to the next generation , <unk> and generation generation , generation after generation ."
"from a <unk> standpoint , they &apos;re like me and how <unk> <unk> <unk> to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage of <unk> to climb up into the sea ."
"i think we would all understand the mood , the <unk> of all the <unk> , as he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get <unk> through my work ."
i don &apos;t want to get it by getting <unk> . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t mean <unk> to live the longest one .
"it doesn &apos;t <unk> the biggest <unk> , the <unk> , the fastest , and not even the <unk> ."
evolution <unk> the creatures that are best at the best in their environment .
it &apos;s the only one that &apos;s survival of survival and success .
"on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria , are there <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> to keep out if the fish were <unk> , they would have the <unk> fish that they were there to do a <unk> environment ."
"so , what does that mean when we look back in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and especially as we <unk> in the next phase , i would say that they would be a number of ways that means that ."
the first is that we &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of <unk> .
"and the reasons for that would be that it &apos;s first done by medicine , a lot of genes that could be <unk> , and that would be <unk> , and from the population ."
"and second , as we have a species , we &apos;ve <unk> our environment so that we &apos;ve done to adapt to us , and we adapt to them ."
"and by the way , we go back and <unk> , we <unk> to say that they can &apos;t say that <unk> is necessary for evolution to <unk> ."
"a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of traditional species , of course , <unk> from the forces of nature ."
"and the argument that this is that the wheels of evolution are slow slowly , but they &apos;re down ."
"and as far as we go , as species as a species <unk> , it will be <unk> and the changes of the environment that could produce natural evolution ."
"but there &apos;s a third possibility , a <unk> , fascinating and <unk> possibility ."
"i call it <unk> -- the new development that &apos;s not just , of course , but led to us as a <unk> in the decisions that we do ."
"well , how did that happen ?"
how could it be possible that we do that ?
"so let &apos;s look at the reality that people today , in some cultures , they &apos;re making decisions about their offspring ."
"they &apos;re in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women ."
"it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the one and the family decide ."
"so think of all , if it wasn &apos;t just possible to choose the gender of your child &apos;s child , but also to <unk> the genetic <unk> , that disease and <unk> ."
what if you could do the genetic changes to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or reduce the <unk> or <unk> <unk> ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
"if we <unk> , this kind of change will be increasingly possible ."
the <unk> genome started <unk> in <unk> and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
"the next year when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in the same time for four months ."
"today , you can take a sequence of three billion <unk> of human genome to a price of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week ."
"it &apos;s not going to take for more to be the reality until the 1,000 dollars is going to give the human genome , and it &apos;s going to be more <unk> ."
"a week ago , <unk> the national academy of sciences of <unk> <unk> for francis <unk> and <unk> <unk> , two scientists , the <unk> developed of the natural process of developing evolution to create <unk> and <unk> into <unk> , <unk> into a <unk> culture ."
"a few years ago , the <unk> of the scientist , the <unk> <unk> <unk> for his research to take a <unk> , a <unk> , and through the manipulation of just four genes , the cell to <unk> a cell ."
these changes are coming in .
"the same technology that can make human insulin in bacteria that can &apos;t be <unk> to just protection from itself , but also by the <unk> of other viruses ."
"whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with <unk> <unk> that has been <unk> in the cells ."
can you imagine something good coming from <unk> ?
"this is all right now , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be much possible ."
so imagine two different changes .
"you can change cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your <unk> ?"
"what if they could change the toes and the <unk> <unk> egg , to give their children a better chance for a <unk> , the diabetes , the diabetes , the risk of cancer , reduce the risk of cancer ?"
who don &apos;t want children ?
"and then the <unk> technology , the same engine of science can allow the change to prevent disease , could allow us to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory ."
"why don &apos;t you have the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , especially if you can <unk> it to the next generation of <unk> ?"
why not the fast <unk> that will allow you to be able to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be <unk> .
"and if we &apos;re in a place where we can <unk> it to the next generation , and we can <unk> the <unk> that we want to be transformed into <unk> evolution ."
"we &apos;re going to have a process that may have been needed for 100,000 years , and we can take it back to a thousand years and maybe even on the next 100 years ."
"these are decisions about the lives , or their grandchildren , have to be <unk> ."
"do we use that decisions to form a society that &apos;s better to <unk> , which is the <unk> ?"
"or will we choose different <unk> that we want to have for some of us , not for others of us ?"
"will we form a society and <unk> is <unk> , or <unk> and <unk> ?"
these are the kinds of questions we need to be <unk> .
"and on the <unk> of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom of the wisdom that we need to make these decisions ?"
"so in good as in evil , and as you might think , these decisions are <unk> to us ."
thank you .
"i want you to imagine a little bit of a <unk> robot that <unk> you , or another , <unk> , helps you to get up and go up and go ."
we &apos;re calling at berkeley <unk> these robots .
"they &apos;re not there other than something that <unk> them in the morning , and that <unk> them , and the speed of their speed will continue and help them keep them with for example ."
that &apos;s actually the true <unk> of human and machine .
"but not just that -- so , <unk> together and connect them with the universe and other devices out there ."
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
"now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldiers who <unk> on average about 100 pounds on his back on his back , and it &apos;s the demand that they should carry on ."
"of course , this leads to some major major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- <unk> <unk> ."
"so we thought we were going to make this challenge , and create a <unk> that would help to help with this problem ."
so let me just introduce you to you now -- or the <unk> universal <unk> .
"<unk> : with the <unk> i can wear 200 pounds over <unk> terrain terrain , many hours ."
"his <unk> design for allowing us to <unk> deep , <unk> , <unk> and highly <unk> movements ."
"it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and increase my strength and <unk> ."
"we are <unk> to imagine our <unk> device , this new <unk> device in this year ."
so it &apos;s true .
"let &apos;s look at the <unk> , and something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about , especially passionate about ."
there are <unk> million people who are <unk> around the world .
this is about a percent of the <unk> .
and that &apos;s actually an <unk> <unk> .
"we &apos;re often talking about very young people with <unk> who are in the <unk> of their lives -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- the <unk> of the <unk> and the wheelchair is the only option ."
"but it &apos;s also about the most <unk> population , which is the number of people ."
"and so pretty much the only option -- if it &apos;s a <unk> , or for the other complications , the wheelchair is the wheelchair ."
"and so , by the way , it &apos;s been for 500 years , for me , as i have to say , very <unk> <unk> ."
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in a <unk> .
"now let me introduce you to <unk> that was carried by <unk> <unk> that had a <unk> <unk> 19 years ago , the result that they couldn &apos;t walk over 19 years and now ."
thank you .
"as i said , <unk> <unk> our <unk> ."
it has sensors .
"his completely <unk> sensors in the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on our <unk> , which is <unk> on her back here ."
"here &apos;s also <unk> , which is <unk> , and as on their <unk> , they &apos;re moving forward , they move forward to this quite <unk> and very <unk> <unk> ."
i was 24 years old and in <unk> when a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> me .
"in the <unk> of a second , i lost every sense and every movement i <unk> ."
"not long after that , a doctor in my <unk> , and he said , &quot; <unk> , you can &apos;t go back again . &quot;"
and this was 19 years ago .
he <unk> every steel hope for my consciousness .
"and <unk> technologies have <unk> to learn from being able to go back to <unk> , and even to go to the hands of the wheel ."
but nothing was invented that would let me go back until now .
thank you .
"as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and to discuss with them ."
"it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential all of the time to change life of future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for <unk> here , for <unk> , but all of them , all of us ."
thank you .
"home in new york , i &apos;m a <unk> of the development development organization , called <unk> <unk> ."
"if i don &apos;t <unk> the poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a volunteer <unk> that fire <unk> ."
"well , in our city , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , you have to be pretty early on the <unk> to be able to get <unk> ."
i remember my first fire .
"i was the second volunteers of the <unk> , so i had a pretty good chance to get into it ."
"but it was still a <unk> against the other volunteers to achieve the <unk> , and to figure out what our tasks would be ."
"when i found the <unk> , he had just had a very serious <unk> with the <unk> who had an worst days of their life ."
"it was in the middle of the night , and she was standing in the <unk> and a barefoot <unk> under a screen outside of the <unk> , while her house was in fire ."
"the other volunteers that was just a <unk> to me -- we call it <unk> from luther -- <unk> , the first first thing to do was asked to go and save the dog &apos;s dog ."
the dog ! i was <unk> <unk> .
"there was some lawyer or <unk> , who now could tell the rest of his life that people went into a <unk> house to save a living , just because it was five seconds as i was ."
"well , i was the next one ."
the <unk> <unk> <unk> me .
"he said , &quot; <unk> , you have to go into the house ."
"you have to go up , and you have to go over the fire , and you have to get a couple of shoes . &quot;"
i <unk> it .
"now , not exactly what i had done , but i went out -- the <unk> up along the <unk> , the real &quot; <unk> , <unk> , that were already being done by the time , just done to a <unk> ."
"i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero ."
"i was wearing my prey back to the bottom , where i met the <unk> of my <unk> and the loved dog ."
"we <unk> our <unk> to the <unk> , where not surprising , the <unk> of his job got more attention than my own ."
"a few weeks later , the <unk> got a letter to <unk> in which they were <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> in their <unk> ."
one of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> : somebody &apos;s had <unk> a few shoes .
"and in my profession , <unk> <unk> <unk> as well as a <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> by generosity and kindness and <unk> , but i also see the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of the individual ."
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
"so if i look around this room and people see people who have either reached a <unk> success or on their way there is to be there , i don &apos;t want to offer that <unk> : don &apos;t wait ."
don &apos;t wait for you to make a difference in your life until you first get your first million .
"if you have something to give you , you &apos;ll do it now ."
"use them in a <unk> , <unk> , in the neighborhood in the neighborhood ."
be a mentor .
"not every day , we will offer a chance to save people &apos;s lives , but every day we have a chance to change one ."
so they &apos;re going to go ahead ; save the shoes .
thank you .
"<unk> <unk> : mark , mark , come back ."
thank you .
i just come back from a community who knows the secret of <unk> of humanity .
"a place where the women are doing the <unk> , with sex , say , &quot; hello , &quot; and the game <unk> is -- where fun is serious about a serious issue ."
"and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco ."
"ladies and gentlemen , their <unk> ."
this is the world of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of congo .
<unk> are together with chimpanzees our next living .
"that means we have a shared <unk> , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago ."
"well , chimpanzees are known for their homes ."
"but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the narrative of human evolution ."
but <unk> show us the other side of the <unk> .
"while chimpanzees are <unk> by large , <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> will lead to <unk> females ."
"they really have <unk> , because it leads to a <unk> <unk> society , which was not <unk> violence in the <unk> of violence ."
"but unfortunately , <unk> are the least known among the primates ."
"they live in the deep <unk> of the <unk> , and they &apos;re very hard to get into the <unk> ."
"congo is a paradox -- a country of <unk> diversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness -- the <unk> of a violent <unk> that has <unk> for decades and almost as many <unk> as the first <unk> of world ."
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction also <unk> the survival of the <unk> .
"and the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t even fill the <unk> with the record -- and even there we &apos;re not sure to be honest ."
"and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh that the trees are <unk> ."
who are these <unk> ?
"we know them as &quot; love with war &quot; <unk> , because they have <unk> , also <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , with <unk> , and rules that are <unk> and social <unk> ."
i &apos;m not saying that &apos;s the answer to all the problems -- because life is made of <unk> than the <unk> .
<unk> -- like people -- love to play their lives long .
game doesn &apos;t just mean <unk> .
and it &apos;s essential to us as a game of <unk> relationships and the <unk> of tolerance .
we learn to trust and the rules of the game .
"play <unk> and creativity , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of <unk> , diversity of behaviors , across <unk> , diversity ."
"and if you look at <unk> <unk> , you see the <unk> <unk> of human <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ."
play is the <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> .
"well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique <unk> from the wild ."
"first of all , a <unk> <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> ."
so here we see a young female and male in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of this : &quot; she <unk> to the <unk> . &quot;
"just that i think it &apos;s more like it , not true ."
yes !
"so <unk> are <unk> , both with <unk> and people ."
"and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> that you get new elements to play -- like the <unk> -- and also how the <unk> is having to engage and how it &apos;s a lot of play ."
but the game is a <unk> .
"play is a <unk> , and it can be <unk> many forms of <unk> that some are <unk> , <unk> , maybe to discover the <unk> ."
"and i want to show you that this is <unk> , a young , and she plays <unk> with water ."
"i think exactly how they &apos;re playing alone , we sometimes , and we &apos;re <unk> limits from our inner worlds ."
"and it &apos;s this <unk> curiosity that makes us <unk> , and interact with the <unk> that we form , are the real <unk> of creativity ."
"this is just a little <unk> of <unk> , <unk> us in our past and present ."
"but they also have a secret to our future , a future that we need to adapt to <unk> challenges by bigger creativity and <unk> <unk> ."
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is .
"in other words , game is our <unk> ."
"to adapt to a <unk> world , we need to play ."
but are we going to do the best from our <unk> ?
play is not <unk> .
but essential .
"for <unk> and people , the same is not <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> alone , and they &apos;re <unk> alone ."
"if it &apos;s hardly <unk> , perhaps it seems like <unk> at the <unk> ."
"and so , my <unk> , let &apos;s play this gift of evolution and together , as we play creativity and <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> ."
thank you .
"i want you to imagine two <unk> , middle , the same day , at the same time , at the same moment , every baby -- okay ."
"so two <unk> , every baby <unk> a baby ."
"now i don &apos;t want you to imagine that you &apos;re using the <unk> time , because if you &apos;re <unk> all the time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me ."
just imagine that for a moment .
"and in this scenario , imagine that in a case the <unk> is a y <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> ."
"and in the other case , the <unk> is <unk> a x prize , which <unk> the x prize <unk> ."
"both of them are <unk> , both <unk> ."
we &apos;ll go back to those people later .
"most of my <unk> , i have two <unk> ."
"under one <unk> , i <unk> with the story of <unk> ."
"i &apos;m a <unk> , and i &apos;m in this case , i &apos;m <unk> how people with <unk> <unk> -- that means human body , <unk> body -- <unk> , with <unk> , <unk> , like they were thinking about the body ."
"the other <unk> i &apos;ve been <unk> with my work is the <unk> , as a <unk> -- or , as i sometimes say , as <unk> <unk> -- from people , the patient &apos;s <unk> ."
"in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> <unk> , the social norms in question ."
"so i &apos;ve been working with people who are <unk> <unk> , two people in a body ."
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than the other .
"and very often , i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people whose gender is their gender -- so people who don &apos;t <unk> the average <unk> of the average <unk> or female <unk> ."
"and as general , we can use the word <unk> ."
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i just give you a couple of examples of the kinds of <unk> that are not <unk> to the <unk> or female <unk> .
"in a case , you may have a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y leaves leaves the <unk> , the <unk> we have to <unk> stage ."
and that &apos;s why the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> stage is testosterone .
"but because this individual <unk> <unk> the <unk> to realize that testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone ."
and that &apos;s called <unk> .
"so , much testosterone , but not a reaction to that ."
"as a consequence , the body <unk> more the typical female <unk> ."
"if the child is born , it looks like a girl ."
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s got to be raised as girls .
"but it &apos;s usually until they get the <unk> and their <unk> grow and grow , but not to get their period until someone comes to that there is something else ."
"and they do some tests and find that they &apos;re <unk> instead of <unk> and <unk> , in fact , <unk> and <unk> that they have a y <unk> ."
"and it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually think that person &apos;s person to actually be more <unk> , but they &apos;re not really ."
"women , like men , in our bodies , have something that you call <unk> ."
they &apos;re in the <unk> of our body .
"and the <unk> are <unk> , which is the <unk> hormones ."
"most women , like me -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real <unk> , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like i &apos;m in <unk> ."
we produce <unk> and we &apos;re talking to <unk> .
the consequence is that somebody like me actually has a brain that has been <unk> to <unk> more than a woman who was born with <unk> and has a <unk> .
"so , gender is really complicated ; <unk> are not just in the middle of gender -- in some sense , in a sense , can you be over the whole range ."
"another example : a few years ago , i got the phone phone from 19 years ago , who was born as young , he had raised a friend , had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , and he had just found a <unk> , and he had just found a <unk> ."
he had a <unk> form of a <unk> <unk> .
"it has <unk> <unk> , and in the <unk> , its <unk> were so <unk> so much that they basically created a male <unk> ."
"and as a result , his <unk> <unk> <unk> , his brain was <unk> to the <unk> part of the <unk> ."
"and when he was born , he saw like a boy -- nobody was <unk> ."
"and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually because he was <unk> down in the <unk> that the doctors found out that he was in the inner <unk> ."
"okay , just just a quick example of a <unk> of <unk> ."
"some people with <unk> chromosomes , develop something called the <unk> , which is <unk> by <unk> <unk> ."
we don &apos;t know exactly why it happens .
"so , gender can occur in many different <unk> ."
"the reason why kids have to do this kind of body -- is it <unk> or <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> to the surgeons that often is not because it &apos;s a physical , it &apos;s a <unk> of advantage ."
"in many cases , these people are completely healthy ."
the reason why on them often <unk> different kinds of <unk> <unk> are because they <unk> our social <unk> .
typically our system is based on the idea that there &apos;s a certain <unk> of both identity that &apos;s associated with a particular identity .
"so we have the concept that a woman is to have a female identity ; a black person to be a black , is said , &quot; <unk> a african <unk> in terms of own history ."
so we have this terrible <unk> idea .
"and if we are <unk> with a body that actually <unk> something very different , that <unk> us in terms of that <unk> ."
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> .
and our nation is really based on a very <unk> concept from <unk> .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born to two individuals in a body .
"where i had <unk> most <unk> in the last time , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year , whose gender at <unk> <unk> in berlin question was asked ."
"many journalists call me the question of : &quot; what kind of test are you going to do , you know , are we going to do with <unk> <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;"
"and i had to explain the journalists that journalists , that this test doesn &apos;t have ."
"we now know that gender is complicated enough that we need to <unk> that nature doesn &apos;t have to <unk> between <unk> and <unk> , or <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> , of course , as the <unk> ."
"so we have a situation where we have the more science that we have to <unk> , so we have to <unk> that these categories that we had <unk> <unk> to create very simple categories of <unk> , which are very , very <unk> , we have to create a lot more efficient <unk> , as well ."
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
"it &apos;s also about a race , which has more complicated than our <unk> <unk> ."
"we get into our <unk> , in all kinds of <unk> areas ."
"we &apos;ve <unk> for example , in the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees ."
what should we start with the fact that we &apos;re only <unk> from them by a few <unk> ?
"as we move our science to further forward , we get increasingly into a zone of the <unk> , where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that we probably had are too simple ."
we see this in all kinds of human life .
"one of the areas that we see in the <unk> of our culture in today , in the united states today , are the <unk> about the beginning and the end of life ."
we have difficult conversations about what &apos;s going to be a body to people so that he &apos;s got another right as the most <unk> life .
"we have very difficult <unk> , <unk> , perhaps not as the public as in medicine -- about the question , when someone is dead ."
our ancestors had never been so hard to fight when someone was dead .
"they have <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and when they moved it , they didn &apos;t <unk> them ."
"if you don &apos;t move it anymore , you <unk> it ."
but we &apos;re now in a situation where we &apos;re going to take people out <unk> organs and they want to put other people into their own .
"and as a result , we were going to get into the fight with really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation that we don &apos;t have more than simple ."
"now , you could <unk> that the whole <unk> of categories of somebody like really happy me ."
"i &apos;m politically <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> people with <unk> bodies , but i have to <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> me ."
"to understand that these categories are really much more <unk> than we thought , i &apos;m going to do ."
and it makes me <unk> with the <unk> that democracy is <unk> .
"so to tell you about this <unk> , i have to first admit that i &apos;m a big <unk> of the <unk> ."
"i know that they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great ."
"i think that they were so <unk> and so <unk> , and so radically , in which they were doing that i <unk> to look at the <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because it &apos;s absolutely forgotten ."
it &apos;s because of what <unk> has happened to the <unk> .
"the <unk> were from my view of the original activists , and that &apos;s why ."
"what she did was a very best concept , and she <unk> it by another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years of <unk> ."
"as you all remember , our <unk> <unk> the concept of <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> in the reason for a very <unk> concept of <unk> ."
"the <unk> of the ancient world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of the <unk> ."
they had a concept of <unk> blood .
"they were the notion that people who have the political power should have this political power , which is the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the father to the father and so on ."
"the <unk> <unk> this idea back and <unk> it through a new concept concept , and this idea said that all people were <unk> ."
"they <unk> the <unk> and decided that <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , not the differences , and that was very radical ."
now they did this because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were <unk> .
"democracy grew up , but at the same time , the science was also growing ."
"if you look at the story of the <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of you have been interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world ."
"they went from <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> things like a <unk> concept of power , back where the <unk> transmission is based on a very <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
they moved to a <unk> concept .
"and if you look at the <unk> , you talk about nature and the god of nature ."
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
"and as part of that , they <unk> us a concept of <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
and they were really prepared for the future <unk> .
"they didn &apos;t think about that , but what they did for us , was great ."
so what happened then for years ?
"for example , women used to <unk> the right to the concept of <unk> , which says that <unk> <unk> is important as the <unk> difference , and said , &quot; we have a <unk> and <unk> , as a <unk> , not enough difference , we should not have the difference , that we have the difference the"
and women <unk> the successful thing .
"next was the <unk> <unk> , where did we see people like <unk> <unk> , who were <unk> about , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;"
"we find men in the <unk> row of <unk> , who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;"
"again , people <unk> <unk> that <unk> to both <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ."
we see the same thing in the <unk> .
"of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the <unk> , we have to start asking for question why we <unk> certain <unk> ."
"now , <unk> , i want to see certain <unk> <unk> , <unk> , in our culture ."
i don &apos;t want to give you the same fish as a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say we should take away from the <unk> .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should have the right to give their sex <unk> or to marry .
"so there are some <unk> that make sense of what i think , and we think we should keep ."
"but the challenge is to try and figure out what it is , and why we keep them and whether they &apos;re useful ."
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that have been <unk> at the beginning of the talk .
"we have two creatures , both <unk> in the same day <unk> ."
"let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , maria <unk> <unk> <unk> , so she was born on one of june 1980 ."
"henry , on the other side , is born for <unk> , so he &apos;s born at the one march of 1980 ."
"just because of the fact that maria &apos;s <unk> was born three months ago , they <unk> all sorts of rights to henry <unk> -- who was right to choose the right to <unk> the right ."
"henry has to be waiting for this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the <unk> of his birth ."
we &apos;re still finding other <unk> about what their rights are .
"henry , there &apos;s a <unk> that he &apos;s <unk> -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s with <unk> -- there &apos;s a <unk> -- because he &apos;s now <unk> , he can &apos;t be <unk> , which is going to be <unk> ."
"but the reason , however , can &apos;t be in all states , the right to see the henry in all states , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing right now ."
"henry can marry a woman every state , but maria can only marry a woman a few states today ."
so we have this <unk> <unk> categories that are <unk> in many ways and <unk> .
"and for me , the question is : what are we going to do because our science is going to make progress in the field of <unk> that we have to get a point where democracy could be <unk> , that might be based on <unk> ?"
"i don &apos;t want to give science , but at the same time , it feels like science is <unk> ."
so where do we go ?
"it seems like our culture is a kind of <unk> <unk> , &quot; well we have to pull somewhere , you &apos;re going to pull it somewhere . &quot;"
but a lot of people <unk> to get <unk> in a very strange position .
"so for example , texas , at a point , decided that a man would marry , that you didn &apos;t have a y <unk> , and you would have a woman to marry a y ."
"now in practice , people are not tested for their <unk> ."
but it &apos;s very <unk> because of the story i told you about the beginning of the <unk> .
"if we look at the <unk> of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he <unk> us in his &quot; i have a dream , &quot; a way to address ."
"he says , we shouldn &apos;t be asked to <unk> people , but after the <unk> of their character &quot; <unk> , &quot; and so beyond ."
"and i want to say , &quot; yes , it sounds like a good idea . &quot;"
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you <unk> people from their <unk> ?
"i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be <unk> in terms of people , because i have to be able to <unk> a series of golden golden set , probably some of the people i &apos;ve ever been making ."
"i want to suggest that i probably know some of the <unk> <unk> that are <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> decisions about their <unk> relationships as some of the most <unk> that i know ."
so how do we <unk> the question after the <unk> of the character ?
it turns out that &apos;s really hard .
"and part of my mind is , what if the content of a personality something that would be made in the future -- could be made by an image ?"
do we really want to go into that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
"what i know is that it really seems to be important to think about the idea that the u.s. is to make the people in doing this , to think about questions about democracy ."
"in our <unk> , we &apos;ve made our stuff right , and i think we &apos;d make our thing good at the future ."
"we don &apos;t have the situation , like , for example , in iran , where a man who feels <unk> to others other men , who &apos;s <unk> to be <unk> , because he &apos;s going to be <unk> to a <unk> <unk> ."
<unk> of these kinds of things that we don &apos;t exist .
"i &apos;m glad to say that we didn &apos;t have these <unk> -- a surgeon , a surgeon that i talked to a few years ago , had a <unk> <unk> with <unk> to make them <unk> ."
"but when i went to <unk> , and he asked him why he did these <unk> -- it was <unk> <unk> -- his answer to his country , that the children would be very <unk> , and so he had to do it ."
"i was talking to him , &quot; well , did you get to the political <unk> instead of <unk> to separate them from them ? &quot;"
"the united states provide incredible ways to allow people who are they , without changing the state of the will ."
so i think we need to be more <unk> .
"all right , i want to see <unk> , i &apos;d like to talk a lot about the fathers ."
"and i want to think about the possibilities of how democracy might look , or looked like , if we had more involved ."
"and i want to say something that &apos;s radical is a radical , and i think there could be different insights that give different kinds of <unk> <unk> of different kinds of <unk> , if people are using a <unk> ."
"i &apos;ve been interested in <unk> for years , i &apos;ve been interested in research in the field of research ."
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women are in terms of how they &apos;re thinking and <unk> in the world .
"what we &apos;ve seen from <unk> studies is that women , on average -- not every average , but on average , tend to be complex social relationships and the health of people who are within the group , are very much attention to a very much attention ."
"and so , if we think about it , we have a interesting situation to us ."
"years ago , when i was a <unk> , i asked myself to have been a <unk> , who knew my interest in feminism -- i was as a <unk> , so i &apos;m doing it -- really a really <unk> question ."
"he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s feminism is . &quot;"
"and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the <unk> question i &apos;ve ever heard ."
"feminism is about <unk> about gender <unk> , that &apos;s not <unk> ."
"but i thought more about his question , as much more , i thought there could be something that was <unk> in feminism ."
"this is what it might be called , which is , on average , <unk> female brains of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to our social relationships , and <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> ."
"so where the <unk> <unk> were extremely <unk> to figure out how individuals were protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we <unk> more to this concept , we can do more like a <unk> of <unk> , but just as we can &apos;t care ."
"and perhaps it &apos;s where we need to go in the future , if we have to go to <unk> democracy -- less about the individual body -- to think about what identity is about and more relationships ."
"so that , if we try to create a <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other ."
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> and that &apos;s my suitcase .
"but before i show you what i &apos;ve done in that , i &apos;m going to make a very public <unk> , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> ."
"i love to have any opportunity to find a different <unk> to have <unk> , to have a <unk> , to photograph , and to photograph recently and to photograph ."
but i don &apos;t <unk> new .
i get all my <unk> <unk> hand on <unk> and <unk> .
"<unk> , thank you ."
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> to the environment and also the <unk> of my <unk> .
"i meet all sorts of great people ; my dollar for a good purpose , i see pretty unique ; i see it &apos;s going to be <unk> to my personal <unk> ."
"i mean , what am i going to find today ?"
will it have my size ?
will i like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
"if everybody answers <unk> , i feel like i won ."
"i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ve been doing here for the exciting week at ted ."
"i mean , what does someone like so many <unk> ?"
so i &apos;m going to show you very closely what i brought with .
"i brought seven <unk> , and that &apos;s all ."
"<unk> for exactly a week , all of i did in my suitcase ."
i <unk> that i would have anything i would like to wear if i could find it after <unk> <unk> .
"and since you haven &apos;t heard me as the woman who &apos;s going to walk around here in ted <unk> -- that &apos;s called , i &apos;ve found some things ."
and i want to show you the most <unk> for that week .
does it sound good ?
"while i &apos;m doing that , i &apos;m going to take some of the lessons i &apos;ve been to believe or not to wear from those <unk> , not to wear nothing new ."
let &apos;s start with <unk> .
i call the <unk> tiger .
"you don &apos;t have to spend much money on it , and you &apos;re <unk> ."
you can almost look almost great for less than 50 dollars .
"this whole <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , who &apos;s been <unk> to me , and it was the most <unk> piece that i &apos;ve <unk> in this week ."
monday : color is something <unk> .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad <unk> if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy you &apos;re happy to get other people .
tuesday : <unk> <unk> is being completely <unk> .
"i spent a lot of time doing that , trying to be able to adapt to myself and adapt to the same time ."
"just be , who you are ."
"if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , they &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;re going to estimate it ."
<unk> : <unk> her <unk> child .
"sometimes i tell people , i saw it , as if i can play <unk> or i can remember her <unk> ."
"i like to say , &quot; thank you . &quot;"
<unk> : <unk> is the key .
"if you think you &apos;re going to see something good , it &apos;s almost quite safe ."
"and if you think that you don &apos;t look good , you probably have right ."
i grew up with a mother who taught me that day for day .
"but only when i got 30 , i really understood what that means ."
and i &apos;ll just give you that for you .
"if you believe you &apos;re inside and <unk> , there &apos;s a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear ."
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody in this audience here .
we should be able to <unk> everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a <unk> truth -- five words -- golden <unk> fit to everything .
"and finally , <unk> : a own , personal style to develop is a great way to tell the world without telling a word about it ."
"it was always <unk> me and <unk> when people came to me in the week , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversation ."
"obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase ."
"so before i go home to <unk> , i will <unk> it ."
because the lesson that i &apos;ve been trying to learn from this week is that it &apos;s okay to go .
"i don &apos;t have to be emotionally emotionally , because i have to go around the corner , and just to get a different kind of crazy , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> that just waiting for me to love a heart and find it ."
thank you very much .
thank you .
"good day , all of you ."
i have something i want to show you .
"think of this as a <unk> , as <unk> <unk> ."
"this is what we call in our lab , <unk> design ."
let me tell you a little bit about it .
"now , if you take this image -- i &apos;m originally <unk> , and everyone in italy <unk> in this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is the formula in the formula for the last couple of decades ."
"so , a few times , if you wanted to win a formula for a formula , then you took your budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car ."
"and when the car and the driver were good enough , it won the race ."
"now , today , if you want to win a race , actually something like this -- something that &apos;s <unk> in real time , some thousand sensors , use a thousand sensors in the car , and then use this information to <unk> and then <unk> the system and then <unk> it ."
"they would call this in <unk> , a <unk> ."
"and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made by two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> ."
what &apos;s interesting today is the <unk> start in our lives .
"our cities were <unk> over the last few years , with <unk> and electronics ."
they &apos;re going to be free .
"and as a computer in the free , they start to react to other ways , they &apos;re going to be <unk> and <unk> ."
"when we <unk> cities , that &apos;s actually a big thing ."
"by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth , but 50 percent of the global population there are life ."
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- they &apos;re going to cause to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
"so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big thing ."
"beyond the cities , <unk> all of this sense and drive into objects in their daily lives ."
"this is from a <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> later , while the summer , <unk> ."
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> with me . &quot;
"now , all of our objects , our environment , start to speak back ."
"in a sense , it &apos;s almost like any <unk> there is to either out there to both a sensor , a sensor ."
and that &apos;s radically different interaction that we have people with our environment .
"in a sense , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of <unk> ..."
"you know , when <unk> shaped the <unk> , it means that it took off the hammer , and <unk> it down to <unk> -- you can still see a little <unk> -- and said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;"
"now , today , our environment starts to <unk> us to answer us ."
"i &apos;ll just show you some examples -- again , with the idea of <unk> our environment and <unk> ."
let &apos;s start with the perceive .
now the first project i want to show you is actually one of the first of our <unk> .
it was a <unk> and a half years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually using a new kind of network that &apos;s used to use all over the world -- that &apos;s a <unk> -- and <unk> <unk> and <unk> information from this network to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
the summer was a <unk> summer -- 2006 .
it was as a italy called the <unk> war .
"some of you will remember , it was as a <unk> against <unk> , and then at the end of the <unk> , the <unk> ."
"and no matter , italy won the end ."
"now look at what happened in that day , just watching activity , the inside of the network ."
here &apos;s the city .
"you see in the middle , the <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"the morning , the game ."
you see the top .
"in the afternoon , people here , and there , the calls are <unk> and moving ."
the game starts -- silence .
<unk> makes a <unk> . italy makes a <unk> .
"<unk> , people who make a short call , go on toilet ."
second <unk> <unk> . the end of normal <unk> .
"first <unk> , second ."
"<unk> , in a moment of <unk> ."
italy wins . yeah .
"now , in this night , all of the <unk> went to celebrate ."
they saw the big <unk> .
"the next day , all the center went to the <unk> and <unk> the minister of the time to meet ."
and then all of the <unk> .
"you see the image of space <unk> <unk> , where since the <unk> time , people have to go to celebrate -- and you see a big party , and you see the <unk> at the end of the day ."
"well , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it for a few years ago ."
"another quick example of feeling : this is not about people , but to use things that we use and consume ."
"now , we all know about where our stuff comes from ."
this is a map that shows you all the <unk> that a mac that &apos;s like they came together .
but we only know about where things are going .
"so in this project , we &apos;ve actually designed some little <unk> to track the waste through the system as it goes through ."
"so we started with some volunteers that started to have a year before , in seattle , to be helped to <unk> things that they were <unk> -- different kinds of things like they could look at them -- things that they would throw them out ."
then we have the small <unk> that we &apos;ve got the little brands that <unk> the waste and started to track it .
here are the results that we have right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
and we realized that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things in the same way with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this is happening a lot of <unk> and more complicated things .
"but the other thing is that we believe that when we see that every day we see that the cup that we throw away , we don &apos;t just go away from it , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet ."
and the <unk> we still throw away every day .
"and if we show that to people , we can move forward to a <unk> ."
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
"my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could tell you much more about the sense of the experience and the many other wonderful things that you can do with them , but i want to talk to the second part of our <unk> , and we <unk> ."
"and the first project is something that we did in <unk> , spain a few years ago ."
and it started with a question of the <unk> that came to us and said that spain and <unk> have a beautiful tradition of the public places as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to connect new technology ?
"and one of the ideas that were <unk> with one of the <unk> was , imagine , imagine , imagine these <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , open up and open ."
they &apos;re doing something like a <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
"if these <unk> fall down , they can write , they can <unk> patterns , <unk> text ."
"and you can get to them , and it &apos;s going to open up to get you to see how you can see on this picture ."
"well , we &apos;ve introduced the <unk> <unk> ."
it <unk> with him .
and we got the <unk> building a building at the expo .
we called it the digital water <unk> .
the whole building was out of water .
"there &apos;s no doors or windows , but when they &apos;re starting to get into it , it will open up and let it open ."
the roof was covered with water .
"and if it &apos;s <unk> , if you want to <unk> the <unk> , you can even leave the roof down ."
"or you could close the building and close the architecture , as in this case , you know , those days , if you get the roof , you get pictures of people , you get pictures , &quot; you &apos;ve got the building . &quot;"
"no , they didn &apos;t <unk> the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost goes away ."
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who &apos;s asking what &apos;s happening inside .
"and here , i &apos;m looking at me , when i was trying to test the sensors that <unk> the water , not getting wet ."
"now , i should tell you what happened at night when all the sensors worked on the <unk> ."
"but in fact , it was a more <unk> of fun at that night ."
all the kids from <unk> came to the building because the way they played with the building was very different .
"no longer a building that would open up to you , but a building that had still <unk> and <unk> and holes in the water , you had to jump without <unk> ."
"and that was , for us , very <unk> , because as architects , engineers , as designers , as designers , we always think about how people are using things that we use ."
but the reality is always <unk> .
and this is the nice thing to create things that are used to interact with people .
"so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the <unk> on it ."
and this is what brought us back to the project that i &apos;m going to show you .
imagine that <unk> could really start flying .
"imagine if you could have little <unk> that fly through the air , and every one of you with a little <unk> of light with <unk> -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space ."
here &apos;s the video .
"imagine a <unk> , like the one that you saw earlier , that you saw with others , completely in <unk> ."
you can have that cloud .
"you can have a kind of nervous screen or <unk> , like this -- a <unk> <unk> in two dimensions ."
"or <unk> , but in three dimensions , where that changes , the light is not the position of the <unk> ."
you can play with different kinds of different things .
"imagine the screen could just appear in different <unk> or <unk> , in different ways of <unk> ."
"but then all of this could be a <unk> cloud that you could <unk> on and move through the <unk> you can look at many , many directions ."
"and here &apos;s a real <unk> , <unk> <unk> of how they &apos;re doing a <unk> <unk> ."
"if you look at the light , it looks like this , so the way we &apos;ve seen it before ."
imagine every single one of people is being <unk> .
it could have every single <unk> an impulse that comes from people to the movements of people or so forth .
i want to show you something about the first thing .
"we &apos;ve worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the <unk> theater in new york and the <unk> in <unk> -- we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d for using them to use it as a <unk> ."
here you see <unk> dance .
"on the left side , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> <unk> ."
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> at the same time .
so that you can make motion .
you can do that all the time .
"but then , once we have <unk> , they can play with color and play motion and <unk> ."
we want to use that as a possible <unk> for the <unk> .
i want to show you the <unk> project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;ve been working on the olympics in london .
"it &apos;s called the <unk> , the cloud ."
"and the idea is , again , imagine what we do with people to do with <unk> and change the environment -- almost as we call it , <unk> <unk> like a <unk> <unk> , but a <unk> ."
imagine that every little <unk> can give a <unk> for a <unk> .
"i think that the remarkable thing that &apos;s the last year , the last decades , is that we &apos;re <unk> from a physical to a digital world ."
"it has all <unk> , knowledge , and it &apos;s available to the internet ."
"now , we can go to the first time -- and the campaign campaign has shown that -- we can change from the digital world , from the <unk> forces of the physical world ."
"that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol of design ."
that &apos;s what &apos;s built in the city .
"but tomorrow , it can be able to ask us the <unk> challenges -- think of climate change or the co2 emissions -- how we can change from the digital world to change ."
"so the idea is that we actually do the people with <unk> , where they do things together ."
"the cloud is a cloud from <unk> , in the same way as a <unk> cloud of <unk> ."
and these particles are water as our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
"it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s covered with <unk> ."
they can move in the inside and make different kinds of experiences .
"you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments of 2012 and the other parts of the <unk> and the way that the <unk> ."
"so both the physical cloud in the sky and can go to the top of the <unk> , like london &apos;s new <unk> ."
they can <unk> .
"and a kind of digital <unk> in night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everyone who want to go to the top ."
thank you .
"as an artist , i &apos;m very important to the context ."
"through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separate from nature , and everything is connected to each other ."
"the first time i was almost 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first <unk> ."
i <unk> to awe .
"my heart <unk> , i was <unk> while i was trying to <unk> what was going on ."
"the <unk> around me was <unk> almost 60 meters from the water , and i could just <unk> that one was <unk> on a <unk> of other <unk> year ."
<unk> are born as a <unk> of a <unk> or <unk> from <unk> .
each one is <unk> its individual personality .
they interact in a more <unk> way with their environment and their experiences .
"some people <unk> and <unk> to the end of the end , while they don &apos;t get <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> passion ."
"if you look at a iceberg , you just think they &apos;re isolated , apart , and just as we see people often ."
but the truth is far away from that .
"as a iceberg <unk> , i <unk> his <unk> atmosphere ."
"and as the iceberg , it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a lot of life ."
"i &apos;m going to take these <unk> of these <unk> , as if i was doing portraits of my ancestors in consciousness that they have exist in these individual <unk> from this way , and never there are ."
"it &apos;s not an <unk> , if it &apos;s not <unk> ; it &apos;s a <unk> of her <unk> along the <unk> ."
one part of the <unk> i &apos;m <unk> is very young -- a few years old .
"and part of the <unk> is more than 100,000 years old ."
"the last images i &apos;d like to show you , a iceberg that i &apos;ve <unk> in <unk> in <unk> ."
"very rare , you &apos;re actually going to be <unk> of a <unk> ."
here you see it .
"on the left , you see a little boat ."
this is about five meters long .
please watch the shape of the <unk> and where it &apos;s at the <unk> .
"you can see here , he starts to <unk> , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there ."
that &apos;s the average size of a <unk> .
"he <unk> about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet ."
and this video is in real time .
"and just so , you show a different side of his personality ."
thank you .
my life is really extraordinary with the work of some amazing projects .
but the <unk> i &apos;ve ever worked on with is this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the &apos; 80s .
"then , one day he came back and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs came back . &quot;"
and that was the outbreak of the outbreak .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood up to him .
"i have a company that makes design and animations , so there &apos;s a complex part of what we think we &apos;re <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> ."
"so we decided that tony -- <unk> -- and <unk> , to support ."
"i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money ."
what are you going to do with that ? &quot;
"and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to tony again ."
"i just want to go back and ask myself , &quot; well , that &apos;s not -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all be able to communicate from these devices ? &quot;"
"and he said , &quot; no , just when you &apos;re hearing about the higher <unk> and an remarkable insurance , you can do it ."
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
"and i said , &quot; how do you do that because now ? &quot;"
did someone see the film <unk> and <unk> ?
so they communicate -- as they walk along the fingers .
"i <unk> , &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;"
"so i came with the need , just a <unk> , and instead i put a <unk> from i didn &apos;t know how to put it on ."
"i &apos;m <unk> to the place , and to the place to his brother and his father -- with the words , &quot; well my <unk> is as he says , tony &apos;s going to talk to him a device , and we &apos;ll find a <unk> that art ."
"because it &apos;s a farce of a dilemma that someone who &apos;s doing this , who can &apos;t communicate , it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;"
so i spoke to a conference a conference later .
"i met these people of <unk> , there was some research research <unk> , and they have a technology that allows them to <unk> a light on any surface and then <unk> it to a <unk> , which was only <unk> the <unk> area ."
so they pull around and they make <unk> like this .
they say that all the things that are going to be <unk> up there are a <unk> effect .
"it starts with the <unk> , then the <unk> , the <unk> , then the <unk> and the last people actually make art ."
but there was always a <unk> in their <unk> .
"so i went home and ate dinner with my wife and i told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use his eyes to <unk> , then we could control it , then we could control things ."
that was the beginning of the journey .
"and about two years later , a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , and we &apos;ve done some things ."
"first , we have <unk> the doors to <unk> , and we actually got a device for <unk> that can communicate with stephen <unk> -- a stephen <unk> ."
that was incredible .
"and it &apos;s really extremely <unk> -- i call it <unk> , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;"
we also have seven programmers from all around the world -- literally from all sides of the world -- to us home .
"my wife , my kids and i &apos;ve been <unk> in the garage , and these hackers and the programmers and <unk> and <unk> have taken our house ."
many of our friends thought we were really stupid to do that and we were <unk> and all of the images on the walls would be <unk> .
"but for two weeks , we went to <unk> , we went to <unk> in <unk> , my children were <unk> , my dog and we <unk> this ."
"it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description ."
"this is a cheap <unk> that we &apos;ve bought at the <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> and a few things out of the <unk> and the <unk> ."
"we took a <unk> , we <unk> them , <unk> them on a <unk> , and now we have a device that &apos;s available to the <unk> -- you can build the code , we can put the code together , the software that you can provide free ."
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free from <unk> .
no insurance can be <unk> .
not a hospital .
"now , each <unk> can actually communicate with his eyes , or draw ."
thank you .
thank you very much . that was incredibly .
"so , at the end of the two weeks , we went back to <unk> room ."
"i love this image , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room ."
there &apos;s all this <unk> <unk> <unk> .
"and after about a year of planning , two weeks of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , he drew my first time to seven years ."
"and that &apos;s a <unk> picture , because this is his <unk> , and it looks beyond his <unk> ."
we have his bed <unk> so he can see out of the way .
we put a wall on the <unk> of the hospital on the hospital .
"and he drew back to the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a sense of a parking lot in the parking lot ."
"we had to <unk> <unk> in the parking lot , we felt like to <unk> as a part of the <unk> ."
"and at the end of the end , he <unk> a email , &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve been <unk> something ."
i feel like i got <unk> down to water and finally someone <unk> down and <unk> my head to breathe so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that <unk> ?
that &apos;s something like our <unk> .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re holding on in the <unk> and it &apos;s still going to evolve .
and we have to do a lot more about this device .
"it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> ."
and someone who has such a <unk> potential to make it so much .
so we &apos;re in the process of finding out how to do it better and more and stronger .
we &apos;ve all had all kinds of <unk> .
we &apos;ve won a few <unk> .
"remember , it &apos;s free , no one of us <unk> it ."
it all comes from our own <unk> .
"so the <unk> were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;"
"armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december , has been honored to us as one of the 50 best invention in 2010 , which was really great ."
"the <unk> is this -- and the <unk> all the circle -- that this april , after the <unk> <unk> <unk> in los angeles , is going to give a <unk> show called &quot; the way of the <unk> . &quot;"
"and there &apos;s probably been so much the hardest of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there ."
"<unk> will be part of the show , which is pretty <unk> ."
"so , i &apos;m basically : if you look at something that &apos;s impossible , then you can do it ."
"all in this room , it was impossible -- this stage , this computer , the microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible ."
do you do it -- all of you here .
"i &apos;m not a programmer , and i never had anything to do with <unk> , but i just <unk> some of it and <unk> me with amazing people , so we could put something on the legs ."
"and that question would everyone be able to put on each day that would be <unk> to you , and if you don &apos;t . if you don &apos;t , and if i don &apos;t , who ?"
thank you .
"so , i write for kids , and i think probably <unk> <unk> ."
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to get like a scientist .
"you can have me as a farmer , or in <unk> , but nobody has ever <unk> ."
today i want to tell you about circles and <unk> .
"now , a <unk> is a certain time , for something that you find because you &apos;ve got it somewhere ."
you go around the <unk> and you take it as a <unk> .
this is a painting of a <unk> .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle of what i want to tell you today .
"my circle started in the &apos; 60s at the high school in <unk> , <unk> , where i was the <unk> ."
"i was the one who was <unk> every week in the <unk> green and blue , until a <unk> <unk> my life ."
they <unk> my life by using the toilet to use me in the <unk> .
they did a <unk> .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go away from the city .
"i had a <unk> , i had 85 dollars , and it <unk> to san francisco in california -- i found a <unk> -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found it &apos;s important to take a work at <unk> ."
"about three or four years ago , i got a call from the night of this <unk> , <unk> woman saying , &quot; i have to see it ."
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned to know each other as adults .
"can you come to <unk> , please , and please come together with the man i know you &apos;ve found it in the same way ."
"and i should mention that i have <unk> , and i want you to go up and please . &quot;"
"well , the next day we were in <unk> ."
"we saw them , we <unk> , we <unk> , we knew that they had to be in a <unk> ."
"we found one for them , we brought them to them , and we <unk> them , and we gave them on their family eight , because it needed to be ."
it was something we knew we knew .
"and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , she <unk> me , she turned out to me in a <unk> <unk> and got <unk> into my hands ."
"what happened was that the circle had closed , it was a circle -- and the <unk> i was talking about ."
the <unk> is that death is part of life .
"she saved my life , and my partner and i <unk> her ."
"and you know , this part of life needs everything that the rest of life needs ."
"he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is what often mentioned today ."
"he needs the same thing -- he would need to love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to give us those things ."
thank you .
"imagine a big <unk> <unk> , as you go to 1,000 feet ."
imagine a plane up full of smoke .
"imagine a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ."
that sounds <unk> .
"well , i had a <unk> place in that day ; i sat down on <unk> ."
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
"so i saw her right now , and they said , &quot; no problem , we probably caught a few birds . &quot;"
"the <unk> had the machine already <unk> , and we were not so far ."
you could see manhattan .
"two minutes later , three of them are <unk> ."
the <unk> used the machine to go out to the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the <unk> .
he <unk> the <unk> .
imagine a <unk> plane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
"he says , &quot; <unk> to the <unk> . &quot;"
i had to talk about the <unk> .
"i could see it in their eyes , because it was <unk> , that was alive ."
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about that day .
i learned that in a moment it &apos;s all different .
"we have this <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to be a hand , and didn &apos;t do all the <unk> i wanted to do , and i never do the experience the experience ."
"while i was thinking about it , i was a <unk> , which is , &quot; i &apos;m <unk> bad <unk> . &quot;"
"because when the wine is <unk> and the person is there , then i open it ."
i never want to move a little bit more in life .
"and that urgency , that goal , has really changed my life ."
"the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we <unk> george washington bridge , quite so <unk> -- i thought , there &apos;s a thing that i really did one of the last one that i really have in the <unk> ."
i had a good life .
"in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i <unk> to become better , in all of the things i &apos;m doing ."
"but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my <unk> space ."
and i <unk> time that i <unk> to <unk> things with people that mean .
"and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people ."
"and then , as i thought about it , i decided to <unk> negative energy from my life ."
"it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better ."
i &apos;ve got two years of my wife <unk> .
it feels great .
"i don &apos;t try to have more , right ; i &apos;m happy to be happy ."
"the third thing i learned -- and the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , &quot; 15 , 13 , 13 , ... &quot;"
you see the water coming .
"i said , &quot; please <unk> into the air . &quot;"
i don &apos;t want this thing to be in 20 parts of the way that you know it was from <unk> .
"while we were <unk> , i had this feeling , human being , not <unk> ."
so almost as we would <unk> our lives for that way .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
"and these <unk> really <unk> into a thought , which is that i just wish to do one thing ."
"i just <unk> , i could see my kids growing up ."
"about a month after that , i went to a <unk> <unk> of my daughter -- <unk> , not much <unk> talent ."
... not yet .
"and i <unk> , i <unk> like a little kid ."
"and in the world , it &apos;s all a sense of me ."
i was realized at the time by putting the dots together that it &apos;s just about a <unk> father .
"more than anything , everything else , is my only goal in life , a good father ."
i was <unk> to die of <unk> that day .
"i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and coming back and to life ."
"my call to all the things that flies today is : imagine what happens to you , the same thing on your flight -- not -- but imagine , and how would you change it ?"
"what would they do to do that , because they think they &apos;d be there for the time ?"
how would they change their relationships and change the negative energy in it ?
"and more than anything else , are the best parents you can only be ?"
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want to build iran .
the most important <unk> there to the <unk> development of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
"the <unk> boxes you see here , these are <unk> ."
"now if we &apos;re <unk> to <unk> the systems that control and the <unk> , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the <unk> ."
these gray boxes are not <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
"but if we can do it , an effective effective <unk> on a laptop that &apos;s used by a <unk> <unk> to <unk> this <unk> box , then we are in business ."
and that &apos;s the planning behind <unk> .
so we &apos;re starting with a <unk> .
"the <unk> are <unk> into the <unk> box , <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"this is a bit of fun , right ?"
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve found that .
"when we started to <unk> our research on six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the sense of the purpose of this <unk> ."
"the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , <unk> , the <unk> part of the <unk> , made by <unk> <unk> <unk> use ."
"and it seemed to seem a little bit <unk> with these gray boxes , that <unk> <unk> ."
"and we started the <unk> project , and we started a <unk> project where we could grow our environment with a <unk> , and we <unk> this <unk> ."
and then something <unk> happened .
"<unk> <unk> like a <unk> that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- <unk> , but didn &apos;t want to eat it ."
this didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
"and after we were working with different kinds of cheese , i was going to be a <unk> attack ."
completely <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
"the <unk> <unk> <unk> , on the gray box , when a particular configuration has been discovered , even when the special program , trying to <unk> it on the target ."
"and if not , then nothing does ."
"so , the <unk> really really <unk> my interest , and we started working with it almost about the <unk> , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is ."
"it might , say , for example , we have an <unk> country , an <unk> power system , or a <unk> in germany ."
so we should find better soon what that goal is .
"so <unk> and <unk> we found the <unk> code and found out that in two digital <unk> of <unk> , a smaller and a bigger one ."
"and also , we realized that they were very <unk> , of people who had all the <unk> of information available to them ."
they had to <unk> bits and <unk> that they had to attack them .
probably they probably knew the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
"and if you &apos;ve already <unk> that the <unk> of <unk> is <unk> and <unk> , you let me tell me , the <unk> are a science for itself ."
it &apos;s much more <unk> than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here &apos;s a <unk> from this <unk> code .
"we &apos;re talking about 15,000 lines of code ."
it looks like <unk> <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we &apos;re able to be smart from this code .
"so what we were first <unk> , <unk> were <unk> because we know what this thing ."
"and then we went to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , trying to get these things to connect with the real world -- with <unk> goals in the real world ."
so we needed theories about these goals that we could have been able to <unk> or <unk> .
"so to <unk> this theories , we call ourselves <unk> that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it has to act a <unk> goal and probably a very much of iran , because most of them were <unk> ."
"well , in this area , there &apos;s not a couple of thousand goals ."
"basically , it &apos;s going out on the <unk> <unk> and on the <unk> in <unk> ."
"so i said to my <unk> , &quot; i <unk> a list of all experts &apos; <unk> and <unk> from our <unk> . &quot;"
and i called them up and i <unk> her knowledge to compare her <unk> with what we found in the code and found out in the data .
and that worked very well .
"so , we &apos;ve been able to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> <unk> ."
"the <unk> is this <unk> part of the <unk> , this black object you see ."
"and if you <unk> the speed of this <unk> , you &apos;re actually able to <unk> the <unk> , and eventually , the <unk> <unk> ."
"what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the <unk> was actually getting slowly and <unk> to what <unk> <unk> is , obviously , going to be able to <unk> so that they &apos;re not going to come up with the fast ."
"the big digital <unk> -- we got a <unk> by <unk> data , and we were <unk> to <unk> ."
"so for example , the number one <unk> is <unk> out of this code , you can &apos;t <unk> ."
"i started to <unk> scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> , and it found that they &apos;re <unk> in <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and every <unk> contains <unk> ."
"so that made sense , it <unk> together ."
and it &apos;s getting better .
these <unk> in iran are <unk> in 15 degrees in iran .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
a very <unk> structure .
"so again , that fit in ."
and this was a great <unk> for what we &apos;re looking at here .
"well , don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s not just that easy ."
these results were done by several weeks of work .
and we were often running into a <unk> and we had to collect new .
"in the case , we found that both digital <unk> actually <unk> and the same goal , but from different directions ."
"the little <unk> <unk> a <unk> , and they <unk> it and they <unk> them and <unk> them and <unk> the big <unk> <unk> into interaction and <unk> of the one ."
"so , in the big and all of us , we &apos;re very <unk> that we actually have , in fact , what the goal is ."
it &apos;s <unk> and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that others could be met by <unk> .
"here &apos;s a really cool stuff that we discovered -- actually , really , really <unk> out of the <unk> ."
"there &apos;s the <unk> box there , and on top , you see the <unk> ."
"now , what this thing is that it <unk> the <unk> of sensors <unk> sensors -- for example , and <unk> -- and it <unk> <unk> code , which is still <unk> , while the attack , <unk> <unk> data ."
"and in fact , this is the wrong <unk> data that we &apos;ve been taken before ."
"so it &apos;s as exactly as in <unk> , where the <unk> is going to be <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> ."
"that &apos;s cool , right ?"
"the idea here is obviously not only , the <unk> <unk> in the control room ."
"in fact , it &apos;s still a lot of dangerous and <unk> ."
the idea is to <unk> a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> there where a human <unk> can &apos;t respond to a fast level enough .
"so , for example , in a power station , if the big <unk> gets too fast , you have to open up <unk> within <unk> ."
"of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human <unk> ."
so this is what we need digital <unk> .
"and if the risk are at risk , really , really bad things can happen ."
the power is <unk> .
"and the <unk> , nor the <unk> , is still going to notice ."
this is <unk> .
but it &apos;s going to get worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he &apos;s not talking about <unk> with nothing .
"so for example , he would work so well -- in a power station , or in a <unk> ."
it &apos;s <unk> .
"and you don &apos;t have to -- as the <unk> -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;ve seen it at <unk> ."
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology to spread .
you have to spread it as far as possible .
"and when you do that , you eventually get a <unk> ."
this is the consequence we need to imagine .
"so unfortunately , the biggest thing is that it &apos;s not <unk> for these attacks in the middle east ."
"they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan ."
"so all these green areas , these are the <unk> environments ."
"we need to have the consequences , and we start to get better at all over ."
thank you .
i have a question .
"<unk> , it became much of the fact that people <unk> that the <unk> is behind the <unk> ."
is that your opinion ?
"okay , you want to know that ?"
yeah . okay .
"i think that the <unk> is involved in the <unk> , but the driving force is not israel ."
so the driving force behind is the <unk> superpower .
"there &apos;s only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- for happiness , to be lucky ."
because <unk> would be even bigger .
"thank you for you , you have a <unk> . thank you <unk> ."
i &apos;ve spent the last few years living in situations that usually are very difficult and at the same time .
i went to jail -- i got a hard .
i &apos;ve worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i filmed in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
"and i spent 30 days doing nothing like this -- <unk> at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end ."
"i actually <unk> the largest part of my career as <unk> as an act of nature , and all of the attempt to study <unk> <unk> , to explore the <unk> and hopefully , hopefully , to a kind of <unk> and the audience , to the audience ."
"so i knew that i would come here to be in a tedtalk looking at the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i &apos;d do something a little different ."
some of you may have heard about that i had a <unk> on ebay for a couple of weeks ago .
"i would send some <unk> <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the possibility to <unk> my tedtalk <unk> ."
"really , some happy people and companies and <unk> , the <unk> opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let them -- the <unk> on the <unk> , or they didn &apos;t see a lot of the one that was either <unk> or the point she didn &apos;t see in the moment ."
"so what you got was this : you &apos;re <unk> here : my tedtalk , my tedtalk , where you don &apos;t have a clue what it &apos;s going to be , and the one could ever be <unk> to the ears , especially if i was your company ."
"but even the other than that , it &apos;s a very good opportunity to do ."
you know how many people are these <unk> <unk> ?
a lot of it .
this is just the <unk> .
"so despite that <unk> , i knew that anybody would buy the <unk> ."
"now if you asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to say this with <unk> ."
"but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising ."
"as i said , i was <unk> in the years of a pretty awful lot of situations , but nothing could me <unk> , nothing could be <unk> to anything so hard to do with this guy in a room ."
"you know , i had the idea for a film ."
"what i want to do is take a film around <unk> , marketing and advertising , where all the film is funded by <unk> , marketing and advertising ."
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
"so what happens in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , is that everything from the top to the end , from the beginning to the end , with <unk> <unk> is <unk> -- from the <unk> you &apos;re going to see in the movie , the brand is the <unk> ."
"now this brand , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> ."
these people will be connected to the film in <unk> -- forever .
"and so this film is going to look at this whole idea -- this is what ? in <unk> , for always ?"
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more than the emphasis .
"it was &quot; in <unk> , for always . &quot;"
"but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand for <unk> , but we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the film ."
"so we may sell a <unk> , and it will <unk> the <unk> that they &apos;ve ever <unk> ..."
"the <unk> car you ever <unk> , &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> , which you &apos;ve ever had , have a attention from &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;"
"so the idea is to show that , apart from that , that brands are a part of life , are actually to actually <unk> them to fund the film ?"
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole <unk> is transparency .
they &apos;re going to see all the things in the film that we &apos;re going to see .
"so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning ."
"and i would be happy to be able to help this , to make this happen ."
"you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the <unk> respect for the audience ."
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people will be .
"do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because that has a negative <unk> -- but you know how that is going to develop ?"
how much money is needed to realize this ?
<unk> million .
"i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth it every case , some really common <unk> ."
"who knows when the film comes out , we may be like a <unk> <unk> ."
what do you think about how the answer is ?
"the answer will probably be very , probably &quot; no . &quot;"
"but is it a difficult thing about the <unk> , or a difficult thing to do about me ?"
<unk> : both .
"so , <unk> , not so optimistic ."
"so , my <unk> , you can help me ? i need help ."
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
"we need to <unk> , which brands do ."
yeah .
if you look at the people you have to do it ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
imagine the camera .
"i thought , &quot; imagine the camera out of &quot; would mean we wanted to lead a <unk> ."
it turned out that it meant that we want to have nothing to do with their film . &quot;
"and just so all of these companies disappeared , one after the other ."
no want to do something with the film .
i was <unk> .
they wanted to have nothing to do with the project .
"and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept of advertising was about how many people can present to people as many people as possible ."
"in particular , today &apos;s world , on this interface of new and old media and the <unk> media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being <unk> in this new <unk> , that the mass is going to bring this mass message ."
"no , that was what i thought ."
"but look , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that was <unk> ."
"in fact , that &apos;s not the mistake of all ."
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
"but what that picture is , you know , is a problem ."
"you see , when you look at transparency in the <unk> , this is one of the first images , that seems to be the first ."
i really like your kind of <unk> <unk> . now .
"this was the problem : transparency -- <unk> of deception , to just explore and <unk> , immediately <unk> , <unk> by <unk> and access to information , especially , what <unk> <unk> -- the last line is the biggest problem ."
"you know , we &apos;re hearing a whole lot of about transparency ."
"our politicians say it , our president says , even our <unk> , say it ."
"but if it comes out , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , something changes ."
"but why ? now , transparency is <unk> <unk> -- as this strange bear , the still <unk> ."
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very <unk> .
what else else is <unk> ?
a whole <unk> of cool food .
this is very <unk> .
"so when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to be a story ."
"we want you to make a story , but we just want to <unk> our story . &quot;"
"look at me as a kid , and my father was <unk> -- and there he &apos;s sitting there and looking at me on this point -- he would say , &quot; my son , there is a child of every girl three versions ."
"there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the true version . &quot;"
"so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version ."
"but there was one company that was ready to help us -- and i had to do it , because i &apos;ve been <unk> and richard <unk> since i &apos;ve been , i found it alone to go to the team and i had to go to my team ."
"so what they started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea how your brand is a problem ."
"i have friends to do the big , huge <unk> , and i have friends who make little <unk> like me ."
"and my friends , the great , <unk> <unk> , say that the reason that their movies are so successful is at the <unk> that they have ."
"and then my friends , who make the little <unk> , &quot; well , how do we deal with these big , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;"
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how much are we going to see <unk> in the film ?
"and always , if i go to the way , and whenever i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see <unk> <unk> ."
"and every time i can tell someone , i can say , &quot; are you enough for this interview ?"
are you <unk> ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you to calm yourself .
so maybe you should have a little bit of this . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
"either <unk> fusion is &quot; or a <unk> <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice ."
"we &apos;re going to be both <unk> for men and women -- <unk> , <unk> , or a <unk> , whatever ."
this is the <unk> .
now i can give all of your questions and give you a <unk> .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
"as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller films , we are as a brand ."
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
"so , this is what you &apos;re doing -- you know , people &apos;s <unk> to <unk> -- this is kind of why we &apos;re interested in ."
"in terms of what words , you would describe <unk> ?"
<unk> is <unk> .
this is a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way to describe something that someone does in the <unk> .
"we talk about <unk> , <unk> ."
"i think <unk> is a great word that <unk> in fact makes something positive , unlike &quot; <unk> smell and <unk> . &quot;"
it <unk> you .
"how can we keep them more <unk> -- better fresh , more fresh , fresh , <unk> ."
and these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
"i have to talk to the man who are like me , <unk> ."
they should tell me about my brand something about my brand .
how do you describe your brand ?
"<unk> , my brand ?"
i don &apos;t know .
i really like nice clothes .
"<unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ."
"well , what is the brand that is <unk> ?"
unique .
"i think the <unk> , the style i have is &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;"
"i like a lot of black colors , many <unk> , and so a stuff ."
"but usually i have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a <unk> and a bit like that ."
"and if dan would be a brand , it would probably be a classic <unk> ."
"man 2 : the brand that i am , i would say , <unk> fly ."
"two , part of the <unk> , the part of the <unk> , i don &apos;t know ."
man 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> .
"i &apos;m <unk> <unk> throughout the country , around the world ."
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
"this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry ."
man 4 : my brand is <unk> because i were <unk> .
man five : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
do that ?
<unk> : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
"well , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i often see a lot of glamour of <unk> &apos;s <unk> and <unk> fly ."
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed to have a experts .
"i needed somebody who could <unk> into my head , someone who could really help me understand what is called the &quot; <unk> . &quot;"
and so i found a company called <unk> in <unk> .
"they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , helped <unk> to discover these <unk> ."
"if you could do it for the other , you could help me ."
"they brought their images , right ?"
i have that . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me a little bit about how your thoughts and feelings about how it is connected to yourself .
these are the people that <unk> my <unk> .
tell me about this world .
"<unk> : this world ? i think the world &apos;s living world where you live -- people live around you , the friends , the family , the kind of life you live , the work of life and the work ."
"all these things come from a place , and for me come and start and start with my family in west virginia ."
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
the next thing . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what &apos;s going to do that in terms of thinking and feelings about you ?
it &apos;s like me to be like .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are <unk> . i like <unk> things .
tell me about &quot; why &quot; <unk> &quot; -- what does it take us ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? what <unk> are you at the right ?
"why is it important , <unk> ? what &apos;s the red ?"
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about them that they &apos;re not .
what else <unk> did they have through ?
"... that doesn &apos;t have to be scared . in the kind of <unk> , what kind of <unk> are you ?"
"<unk> ! no , thank you ."
thank you for your <unk> .
yeah . well . well .
"yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to get out of it ."
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
"the first thing i saw was that this idea that their <unk> two <unk> had <unk> , but <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> ."
the <unk> <unk> very well .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction .
"and i think some companies will only focus on a strength , rather than both ."
"many companies tend to -- and this is the human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re <unk> , these elements , and that they &apos;re welcome to and they &apos;re actually <unk> to themselves and they &apos;re actually <unk> them into ."
what other brands do ?
"the first is a classic , apple ."
"and you can see it here , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
"now , there &apos;s <unk> brands , and <unk> <unk> brands , that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a very strong thing ."
"a <unk> , <unk> brand , how is your brand ?"
"if you asked them to describe their <unk> , their <unk> , how would you ?"
you <unk> them ? are you something that makes blood <unk> ?
or are they more <unk> ?
"are you something that &apos;s a little bit <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ?"
"<unk> are things that are <unk> , <unk> like the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ."
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are they <unk> and <unk> like <unk> ?
"are they <unk> , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> like <unk> ?"
"are they <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , sacred , holy , <unk> and the way the dalai lama or <unk> ?"
"in the course of the <unk> , we had more than 500 companies , the <unk> and <unk> were <unk> and the &quot; no &quot; said they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project ."
"they wanted to do anything with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control of the finished product ."
"but they found 17 <unk> that were willing to <unk> these <unk> who wanted to do with somebody like <unk> and <unk> like me , and the stories that we would never have to tell stories that we would usually tell stories ."
"they <unk> us to tell the story about how we tell the story in this film , that you use <unk> to make the <unk> of the brain , both to make the ad and a <unk> of films ."
"we went to <unk> <unk> , where <unk> were <unk> ."
"in the entire city , for five years , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , nothing ."
"and we drove into <unk> , where companies <unk> their way to <unk> schools in <unk> ."
"the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most feedback or where i had the biggest success , those are where i <unk> with things directly ."
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
"because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the <unk> , and they said that the <unk> may not really have their interest in mind ."
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist .
"i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people think is about the way that the world &apos;s <unk> ."
and what was that for you ? what it did ?
"now , since the film <unk> festival was about <unk> festival , we can look at this ."
"<unk> <unk> was the <unk> in january , and yet -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million <unk> of this film ."
it actually <unk> one <unk> for two weeks .
"this is just online -- no press , no television ."
the film was not <unk> yet .
there &apos;s no <unk> in it . there &apos;s no <unk> .
he &apos;s not out there in other countries .
"well , finally , the film has a very big <unk> <unk> ."
"and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every <unk> we talked about , with their customers , who <unk> to the fingers of it ."
"something that i believe in is that when you give your opportunity to <unk> , you can <unk> that risks in these risks ."
"i think if you keep people from it , you get closer to failure ."
i think that if you train your employees to avoid risks you &apos;re all <unk> for a profit .
i feel that we need to <unk> people to take risks .
we need people to have no fear of <unk> opportunities that they might be able to <unk> .
"finally , in the <unk> , we should welcome the fear ."
we should put the bear in the <unk> .
<unk> you welcome the <unk> . &quot; get the risk .
"each one of the big <unk> full , we &apos;re going to welcome the risk ."
"and finally , we should welcome transparency ."
"today , more than ever before , we get a little bit very , very far ."
"and that &apos;s what i said to <unk> with honesty and transparency , my <unk> called &quot; transparency , &quot; was <unk> by my good friends of <unk> , the <unk> for <unk> dollars on ebay ."
big data is going to be transformed for organizations around the world in great opportunities .
<unk> <unk> : &quot; <unk> &quot; welcome &quot;
thank you .
"now , <unk> , in the name of transparency , what &apos;s happening to the $ <unk> <unk> ?"
that &apos;s a great question .
"i &apos;ve been <unk> a <unk> in my <unk> , <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a <unk> <unk> -- to fund a <unk> in the next year to fund my <unk> ."
my name is <unk> .
"18 months ago , i did something else in google , and i was <unk> to make something with <unk> and art . my <unk> , who &apos;s also here , the green light was , and i was the green light ."
and it took 18 months .
"a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories that i can tell you , with 17 very interesting <unk> of nine countries ."
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal perspective is very simple with this slide and its access .
i grew up in india .
i was a great education -- i didn &apos;t <unk> -- but i had no access to many <unk> and this <unk> .
"and when i traveled , and i went to visit this <unk> , i started to learn a lot ."
"and while i was working for google , i tried to do this <unk> -- art <unk> -- to do technology with technology ."
"we then <unk> a team , a great <unk> , and we started <unk> ."
"i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and i &apos;ll tell you some interesting things that have been going to start out since the start ."
so you just go up to <unk> .
you can look around these <unk> here .
"there &apos;s the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van <unk> <unk> ."
"i &apos;ll even get one of my favorite , the most of the <unk> museum in new york ."
you get in two of this -- very simple .
"<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in the museum ."
"it doesn &apos;t matter where they &apos;re -- <unk> , <unk> , it doesn &apos;t make any difference ."
you go around and you &apos;re <unk> .
you want to <unk> yourself in the museum ?
"open the map , and <unk> it with a <unk> ."
"in it , you want to go to the end of the <unk> ."
just further . much fun .
<unk> them .
"thank you , but the best one is still ."
"so , i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> ."
i see this <unk> .
"when the museum gave us the picture , you click it ."
this is one of the pictures .
this is all <unk> .
"those of you who are really interested in art , can click here -- but i &apos;m going to take that away ."
this is one of the images we &apos;ve <unk> with the so-called <unk> .
"this picture , for example , has about 10 billion <unk> , i think ."
"and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion <unk> ? &quot;"
and i &apos;ll show you this one .
you can do very easily and <unk> .
you see a funny thing here .
i love this guy ; his expression is <unk> .
but then they really want to get deep .
"and so i started playing around , and i found that something about it ."
"and i thought , &quot; well , i think that &apos;s interesting . &quot;"
"i went close to the end , and i slowly realized that these kids actually actually put something ."
"i had a little bit , a <unk> spoke to some of the <unk> , and actually found out that it was a game called <unk> , where a <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> with a <unk> ."
it was very <unk> to <unk> .
"i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it ."
"to really go close to that , you can go up to the <unk> ."
"just to give you the <unk> , i look at what you &apos;re going to see ."
"here we were , and this is the painting ."
"the best thing is , but it &apos;s still a second ."
"let &apos;s jump to <unk> fast , again in new york ."
"another shot of me , <unk> ."
so the <unk> example was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
"and what if you want to see <unk> , as van <unk> has created this <unk> ?"
you put in it . you can actually go into it .
"i &apos;m going to take this image into one of my favorite <unk> , until i really was <unk> ."
"this is <unk> , never seen it before ."
now i &apos;m going to show you my <unk> function .
"there are many more , but i don &apos;t have time ."
"this is the really cool part , and it &apos;s called <unk> ."
"each of you , everybody -- the <unk> or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter ."
you can create <unk> and online your own museum -- from all these pictures you can make your own collection collection .
"just simply , you go in -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the power of the <unk> -- you can <unk> ."
"this is the <unk> , in the <unk> ."
"you can put everything with your friends , you can put your <unk> , and you can start to see what you &apos;re feeling like you &apos;re looking at the <unk> ."
"i think <unk> , for me , is the <unk> that all the wonderful stuff are not coming from google ."
they &apos;re coming out of my <unk> after not even the <unk> .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
"i mean , i hope we &apos;ll be just in this digital medium of art , and they &apos;re just going to represent online online ."
"and the biggest question i &apos;ve been asked by is , &quot; did you have a <unk> experience to <unk> the experience ? &quot;"
the answer is no .
it &apos;s to <unk> the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
thank you .
this is a <unk> of your brain . your brain can be <unk> in two <unk> .
"that &apos;s half the left , which is the <unk> side , and then the rights half , the <unk> side is the <unk> side ."
"if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of every hemisphere , we could <unk> your brain ."
"for example , this one would be completely <unk> ."
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive .
"now , where would you <unk> your brain at that scale ?"
"some of us may have decided to have one of these <unk> , but i think that for most people in the audience , your brain looks like this -- with a high <unk> , who &apos;s in the same time in both <unk> ."
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both <unk> or so much .
you can be <unk> and intuitive .
"and i see that as one of the people , in common with most different <unk> that need a good basis to add complex logic together ."
"but at the same time , we need a good <unk> of the experiments that actually <unk> the experiments ."
"how do we develop these <unk> ? well , we love it with things ."
so we go out and play and we go and see how it would react . and then we start developing our <unk> .
"basically , they do the same thing ."
so one of the <unk> they developed over the years is probably that one thing can be just at the same time .
"i mean , it can be <unk> to think of that as a thing that is at the same time at the same time in two different places , but they were not born with this idea of this idea , they &apos;ve developed it ."
i remember looking at a child playing <unk> .
"he was a <unk> , and he wasn &apos;t very well in it , and he <unk> all the time ."
"but i bet that it <unk> the game that <unk> taught a very valuable lesson , which is that the big thing not just leave you , and that you &apos;re going to stay in a place ."
"and this is a <unk> model of the world , so long they &apos;re not <unk> ."
"it would be a <unk> model for a <unk> , because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little <unk> particles ."
"and if you play with your particles , you &apos;re all <unk> things -- like you &apos;re going to fly directly through walls , or you can be at the same time at the same time ."
"and so they <unk> all these <unk> , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics ."
"that was the <unk> of physics a few years ago , and you needed mechanics to describe the small particles ."
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the big objects of new objects around us .
"it didn &apos;t like my <unk> , and maybe just because i don &apos;t have a lot of games ."
"well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often ."
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
"i mean , nobody has ever seen one particles ."
but my <unk> side didn &apos;t like it .
"because when all things are made of particles and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , then not just should all the rules of quantum mechanics ?"
i don &apos;t see why that shouldn &apos;t be that .
"so i would feel better about the whole thing , if we could sort of show that <unk> also follow the rules of quantum mechanics ."
so i made myself doing this for a few years ago .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see in the <unk> <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a <unk> computer .
and you can see this green point there in the middle there .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is an image of the object .
here &apos;s one thing . let &apos;s look at this .
and here &apos;s a really big <unk> of this little piece of metal .
"so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it is <unk> like a <unk> , and it &apos;s over the <unk> ."
"so i made this thing , sort of , in the way , you do this computer , it makes a computer chip ."
"i went a clean space with new <unk> , and i went to a hundred hours to all the big <unk> ."
"for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a <unk> pool <unk> hole and get this thing ."
"this thing has the ability to be in the <unk> <unk> , but it needs a little bit of help to do it ."
so let me give you an analogy .
you know how <unk> it &apos;s in a full <unk> ?
"i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator alone , i do all kinds of <unk> things , but then i get other people to do all of these things , because i don &apos;t want them to <unk> , or frankly , they &apos;re <unk> ."
so quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects are just feeling .
"the <unk> objects are not just people , but the light that seems to be <unk> and the wind , the wind , and the <unk> of them , the heat of the space ."
"and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is <unk> , we had to go out all the <unk> out ."
and we did that .
"we <unk> the light , we put it into a <unk> and <unk> all the air , and it <unk> it up until almost until it was in the elevator , the piece of metal was <unk> to behave like it wanted ."
so we &apos;ve measured its movement .
we found that it really is moving .
"instead of being quiet , it &apos;s just there , <unk> it . the way it was <unk> about as it was -- like a <unk> and <unk> together ."
"so , in which we gave him a little <unk> , we could <unk> it at the same time , not to <unk> -- something that &apos;s just in the mechanics ."
so what i &apos;m just telling you is what &apos;s really <unk> .
what does it mean for an object to <unk> and not <unk> ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
"so the first case , all the <unk> of atoms that are <unk> from atoms that are silent and the same time , the same atoms go up and down ."
"just to <unk> <unk> voices , <unk> them ."
the rest of the time is they &apos;re <unk> .
"that means that every <unk> is at the same time in two different places , which is , at the same time , that the whole piece of metal is two different places ."
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
"that was worth me for all of this <unk> <unk> , because , you check the <unk> between one <unk> and this piece of metal and the difference between the piece of metal and the piece of the metal and you ."
"so if one single <unk> can be at two different places , this piece of metal can be in two different places of the two places , why don &apos;t they ?"
"i mean , this is just what my <unk> page says ."
"so , imagine if you were at the same time in several places , what would the <unk> do ?"
how would your consciousness handle your body that your body is <unk> in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
"when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , we saw the piece that metal was there in a piece ."
and so i had to develop these new <unk> that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually <unk> objects that are in a small space .
you &apos;re listening to a lot of talks about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
"now , that &apos;s not quite right ."
"there &apos;s more behind that , it &apos;s deeper ."
"it &apos;s like these connections , their connections with all the things around you , literally who they are , and that &apos;s the <unk> and strange quantum mechanics ."
thank you .
"in 2007 , i decided that we should think about economic development ."
"it should be our goal , that when families think about where they want to go and work , they want to be given to them , between at least one hand of different cities that are all in new <unk> ."
we &apos;re far away from that goal .
there &apos;s billions of people in developing countries that don &apos;t even have one city to welcome them to say .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more value than it costs to build .
"so we could do the world very simple with <unk> , perhaps even more <unk> of new cities ."
"now , this sounds may be absurd for you , you &apos;ve never thought about new cities ."
but they just trade the building from cities in the cities .
"imagine that half of the people who want to live in homes , they already have this ; the other half is not yet ."
you could try to expand the capacity to <unk> <unk> .
but you know what you would like to do in these apartments and their environment <unk> to avoid <unk> and avoid <unk> from <unk> .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very difficult to <unk> all of these <unk> .
"but you could go through a completely new place , create a completely new building , you know , that the laws that would support you in the building and not help it ."
"so i have <unk> that governments create new surfaces that provide enough space for a city , and gave them a name : <unk> <unk> ."
"i found that later , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> about the challenge of a <unk> in <unk> ."
"they knew that every year , about <unk> , they were leaving about <unk> , to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do , to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do the same thing ."
"so this is what <unk> <unk> said to <unk> , &quot; what happens to be a <unk> area of our country , what if we simply could make a message part of the american message , and a part of the <unk> , and then where people would want to work on the people to work on the nation"
"in the summer , <unk> <unk> had <unk> <unk> ."
"the next <unk> elections , <unk> <unk> in a <unk> won his program , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ."
he was asked to be <unk> to be <unk> .
"in the meantime , i was <unk> for a talk about <unk> ."
"in improvement , and through the study of <unk> , i tried to try this <unk> concept of <unk> city , basically , to reduce elements of the elements ."
"the first point is the importance of laws , laws that you can determine that you &apos;re not allowed to <unk> <unk> ."
"we &apos;re paying new technologies to pay attention , but for progress , technology needs it and the laws . and it &apos;s for usually the laws that <unk> us ."
"in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk ."
"again , he showed him ."
they call me the two .
"and they said , &quot; let &apos;s put it to the <unk> of our country . &quot;"
so we met in december <unk> of a <unk> in <unk> .
"i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much <unk> they are as they cost ."
and i &apos;ve been using this graph to show how valuable is <unk> to a place like new york . think about that there is a surface in some cases per square square meter .
"but it was a pretty <unk> discussion , in a place when there was a <unk> , said , &quot; paul , could we look at the tedtalk . &quot;"
"so the tedtalk <unk> in very simple form that a <unk> city is a place that &apos;s beginning to be <unk> , a <unk> , which is the laws that <unk> and the people who can &apos;t choose to be either the rules or either ."
"and so i was asked by the president of <unk> , who said that we need to do this project , that it &apos;s important to make it , and that &apos;s the way our country is going to bring our country ."
i was asked to come to <unk> and keep the fourth and fifth january and fifth january .
"so i &apos;ve been <unk> another <unk> talk about the data that has a <unk> like this <unk> to try to prove that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very big city ."
"this is a picture of the city of town , and the <unk> <unk> the new airport that was built in and then in 1980 ."
"by the airport , there &apos;s a <unk> area of 100 <unk> ."
"so i tried to convince the <unk> to do that if you want to build a new city , you have to start with at least 1,000 <unk> ."
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
you &apos;re going to have all <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very serious and paying attention .
"the <unk> of congress came up with the stage , and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you for your talk , but we might be able to look at the tedtalk ."
i have him here on my laptop . &quot;
"so i <unk> myself , and they have the tedtalk <unk> ."
and i came to the <unk> that a new city of the people has <unk> .
"there would be a way of living in a city that would be in <unk> , instead of hundreds of miles away ."
and a new city <unk> also new opportunities for leaders .
"the government of government in <unk> would be <unk> on the help of <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> , they could <unk> the laws of the laws of <unk> and at least to help that they would be <unk> that they can really <unk> the <unk> ."
"and the realization of president <unk> , was that the <unk> of the <unk> that i thought was as a way to get the <unk> <unk> and build this city could be <unk> for <unk> , for many of the <unk> of 2012 and many years ."
we &apos;re in the area of <unk> .
this is from this place .
it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
"and shortly after that , in the 19th of january , they <unk> the constitution for a change in the constitution to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> that &apos;s for special <unk> ."
"in a country that has just been a <unk> crisis behind congress , in which congress , that was <unk> for <unk> to a voice ."
"all <unk> , all <unk> society , <unk> this ."
"to become the constitution , it has to be twice through congress ."
"on the <unk> , it was <unk> to the second time with <unk> <unk> ."
"<unk> after that choice , between the 21st and the 24 / <unk> , traveling a <unk> of about 30 <unk> to the two places in the world , most interested in the business of the business of the <unk> ."
the one place is south korea .
"this is a picture of a big , new <unk> , built in south korea , built <unk> <unk> of big <unk> ."
everything you can see on this picture is taken within four years after it took four years to get the <unk> .
the other place that was very interested in the <unk> is <unk> .
it &apos;s been two cities in china and the third one is in <unk> .
"so if you &apos;re pretty thinking about it , it &apos;s where we &apos;re in the same way ."
"they already have a <unk> , and they &apos;re already <unk> this area for the second city ."
"it &apos;s already been working on a law that allows managers to <unk> , and it &apos;s also worked on a <unk> system ."
a country has already offered its <unk> <unk> to <unk> when the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> system of the system .
<unk> and <unk> are very interested in the same .
they even <unk> them .
"one thing you already know is , you &apos;ve been <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> ."
"there are many <unk> that would like to be <unk> in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are a lot of people who would like to live there ."
all over the world there are 700 million people who <unk> that they like to live in a different place .
a million people left every year and <unk> the united states .
"many of them are <unk> who are forced to <unk> their families to <unk> to <unk> , sometimes they have to make <unk> mothers that need to feed their <unk> and <unk> ."
"unfortunately , sometimes they &apos;re kids who are trying to find their parents that have seen in some cases , in some cases , have never seen more ."
"so what about an idea of building this in <unk> , a whole new city for building ?"
"or even building <unk> from these cities , or hundreds of the world around the world ?"
so what is it for an idea of <unk> that every family has a choice between a number of cities in competition ?
this is an idea that is worth spreading .
"my friends from <unk> have asked me to say , thank ted ."
you know how many decisions you make in a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
"i &apos;ve recently done a survey with 2,000 <unk> , and the average number of decisions that are a typical american population of a day ."
"<unk> was a study that was done recently by <unk> , who saw her a week for the <unk> ."
"and these scientists just have been <unk> the different issues that they &apos;re doing this <unk> , and they &apos;re doing so much of making decisions that are <unk> with the issues ."
and they found that a <unk> <unk> is doing a <unk> job in the week .
"each of these topics was , of course , were made of many , many smaller decisions ."
50 percent of their decisions were <unk> within nine minutes or less .
"just for 12 percent of their decisions , they <unk> an hour or more of their time ."
think about your own decisions .
"you know how many decisions you make in the nine minutes , in <unk> , in one hour of <unk> ?"
"how good , do you think you &apos;re involved in dealing with the decisions ?"
"today i want to talk about one of the biggest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> ."
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some kinds of solutions .
"now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers ."
"if i ask you a question , raise them , because i &apos;m blind , just if you want to burn some calories ."
"otherwise , please , please ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question is for today , are you ready to hear about the <unk> ?"
thank you .
"when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i went to this very <unk> <unk> , at least it was really <unk> ."
"it was a store , the <unk> was ."
"this business , it was almost like a <unk> ."
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually had <unk> <unk> .
"i &apos;ve been going to go to this business , but at a time i &apos;ve asked myself , well , what does you never get something ?"
here &apos;s the oil gang .
"they had 75 <unk> oil , <unk> <unk> , who were <unk> in boxes that came from thousands of thousand old years ."
"so i decided to visit one day to visit the <unk> , and i asked the <unk> , &quot; does this model work that you &apos;re really giving all these possibilities ? &quot;"
and he showed the <unk> of <unk> that came every day and usually their cameras were doing it .
"we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment ."
here &apos;s your <unk> .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we &apos;ve made a little <unk> right at the entrance to the <unk> .
"we have six different <unk> <unk> , or 24 <unk> , and we &apos;ve looked at two things , one is , one i &apos;d been going to be more people and try to stay <unk> ?"
"it &apos;s been more people , if it was 24 , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent ."
and then we looked at what the case people were buying a glass <unk> .
now we saw the <unk> effect .
"from people who were left when they were <unk> , they were only <unk> three percent of them ."
"from the people who stayed when they were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of <unk> ."
"now , if you <unk> it , people bought six times more of glass , who had six to <unk> when they had 24 to <unk> 24 ."
"now , to buy a glass of <unk> , it &apos;s probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our <unk> -- but it turns out that <unk> also <unk> us in very <unk> decisions ."
"we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it &apos;s about our own best interests ."
"so , on the end of the day , <unk> ."
"i &apos;m going to describe one study that i did with <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who we did for the <unk> of a million <unk> of <unk> plans from almost about <unk> plans in the entire united states ."
and what we were looking at was whether the number of <unk> that were possible for a <unk> plan that <unk> the plan that is going to be saved by tomorrow .
and we found that there was actually a context .
"so , in this plans , we had about <unk> plans to do something that people had about two to 59 to 59 fund ."
"and what we found was that the more fund was the more fund that , in fact , the participation was less likely ."
"if you look at the <unk> now , the plans that have two <unk> , had a <unk> in the <unk> -- still not as high as we want to ."
"in the plans that <unk> almost 60 fund , the <unk> was all about the <unk> <unk> ."
"now it turns out that even when they were <unk> <unk> when they were <unk> to <unk> , even , even there &apos;s negative consequences ."
"so the people that decided to <unk> , they were more likely to get more opportunities to them , the more <unk> they were <unk> and <unk> ."
"the more options they were <unk> , the more <unk> they were <unk> their money in <unk> ."
"no one of these extreme decisions , is to be heard of the decisions that someone would be <unk> to people if they were <unk> to their <unk> ."
"well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three fundamental implications of people that provide more and more choices to each other ."
"they <unk> the decision -- <unk> , even when it &apos;s going to be the best interest ."
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
"they decide to be more important for things that they &apos;re doing less <unk> , even if they make it objective better ."
"the reason for this is that we might be able to look at this very <unk> <unk> of <unk> , mustard and <unk> and <unk> , but in fact , we can &apos;t move the <unk> and then actually choose something from the <unk> <unk> ."
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways of <unk> different kinds of data -- which they can just put in your business .
"first of all , <unk> ."
"you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today that less is more ."
"people are always <unk> when i say , &quot; <unk> . &quot;"
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing <unk> .
"but in fact , we &apos;re always going to see more and more , if you &apos;re willing to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> are going to go , well , there &apos;s a increase in <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> &amp; <unk> and &amp; <unk> &amp; amp ; it"
"as a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> species of 26 to 15 <unk> , <unk> it <unk> a <unk> increase in <unk> to 10 percent ."
"as the golden <unk> <unk> <unk> her 10 to the worst <unk> , <unk> that the profit is to increase the <unk> percent of the <unk> of the <unk> of the increase in the rise of <unk> and the <unk> costs ."
"you know , the average <unk> today , you &apos;re giving you about the products ."
"a typical <unk> <unk> gives you 100,000 products today ."
"but the <unk> <unk> , who today is <unk> <unk> of the world , and they &apos;re only providing <unk> products -- a kind of <unk> in <unk> ."
"now in the world of <unk> , i think one of the best examples that i &apos;ve come to the market recently , about how to be the best choice , was something that david <unk> has a very <unk> , a program , a harvard program ."
each of the harvard <unk> is now <unk> by a <unk> .
"<unk> , who really want to meet a <unk> <unk> , will not fund 300 or 300 or a <unk> ."
"you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to <unk> it ."
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
"and the first thing i ask is the employees , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other ."
"and if your employees can &apos;t <unk> them , they can &apos;t . &quot;"
"now before we &apos;ve started <unk> today , i had a conversation with gary ."
and gary said that he would be ready to give all of us a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read you the reading .
"and now i &apos;ll give you a couple seconds to read them , and then i ask them to <unk> them , if you &apos;re ready to <unk> &apos;s <unk> ."
okay . so everyone &apos;s ready to do gary <unk> <unk> .
are you all ?
"all right , let me show you a little more about this ."
"you know , it was a trick , right ?"
"well , who &apos;s ready for this journey ."
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
"in fact , they &apos;re looking at information , when they first had more information than the second time , but i would think it would <unk> that they thought it in the second time ."
because the pictures made it feel <unk> .
"what brings me to the second technology is that helps you to deal with the problem of <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> ."
"it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between possibilities , the consequences that have to be associated with the potential , and that &apos;s what the consequences have to be <unk> and felt ."
"why are people spending about 15 to 30 percent more than 30 percent when they use a <unk> or a card card , as a <unk> ?"
because it doesn &apos;t feel like money .
"and it turns out that if you make it feel <unk> , it feels a very good tool to save people &apos;s disease ."
"so in a study that we &apos;ve done with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study of people who &apos;ve done <unk> -- employees , who &apos;ve been all worked for <unk> -- and these were all their <unk> in a <unk> in her <unk> ."
"and as we go to this meeting , we &apos;ve got these <unk> just as <unk> as they &apos;ve been , we just <unk> a <unk> ."
the <unk> that we have to add up was that we asked people to think just to make all positive things that would happen if they were saving money .
"in the case of us did this simple thing , there was a increase in <unk> to 20 percent , and there was a increase of the number of people who were ready to save or a increase in four percent of the numbers for the numbers ."
the third technology : <unk> .
we can deal with more categories than we can do more choices .
"here &apos;s an example , a study we &apos;ve done in a <unk> ."
"it turns out that in the <unk> industry , it &apos;s in the middle area and down the area , <unk> the number of different <unk> from <unk> to <unk> magazines ."
but you know what ?
"if i show them 600 magazines and show them in 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 papers , and they &apos;re <unk> that i would give you more <unk> and a better than i had a <unk> of them for them for a half of them ."
because the categories tell me how i can keep them apart .
here are two different <unk> .
"one is called jazz , and the other is called <unk> ."
"if you think that the left is <unk> , and the ad is on the left , then you &apos;re <unk> in the hands ."
"okay , there are some of them ."
"if you think that &apos;s on the left side , and the one that &apos;s on the right , <unk> on the right , please <unk> ."
"okay , so a couple more ."
"well , it turns out they &apos;re right ."
"the left on the left is jazz and the on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?"
this is a highly <unk> .
categories of <unk> have to say something that the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and this problem is that you often see when you look at the long list of all of these .
who are you really <unk> with that ?
my fourth technology : <unk> to complexity .
it turns out that we can <unk> more information than we think we need to be able to simplify them .
we need to grow complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
"let &apos;s take a very , very <unk> decision : the <unk> of a car ."
here &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that gives you the opportunity to <unk> your car completely .
they have to make <unk> decisions about their car completely .
now these are different decisions that make decisions about the number of choices that make them decision .
"<unk> , <unk> of the cars -- i have a <unk> possibilities ."
"motors , <unk> -- four possibilities ."
what i &apos;m doing now is i &apos;m going to <unk> the order into the decisions .
"half of the clients are going to be <unk> from many ways to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , four <unk> ."
"the other half of the clients are about the <unk> possibilities , four <unk> , to the <unk> <unk> , many possibilities ."
what do i look at ?
as you &apos;re interested .
"if you use the <unk> all the time in the decision , that &apos;s that you &apos;re going to be <unk> , i &apos;m losing it ."
what they &apos;re trying to figure out is that the people who are going to go from many <unk> to the <unk> and always choose the <unk> .
we lose .
"let them go from the little choice to the many , then they stay in ."
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of opportunities .
"the only thing i did , the order to change is to change that information is <unk> ."
"if i learn to the simple <unk> , i &apos;m going to learn how to <unk> ."
"even though the <unk> <unk> , i don &apos;t tell you about my preferences about the <unk> , it always <unk> me to <unk> ."
"it also <unk> me in <unk> the big product that i &apos;m <unk> , and so i &apos;m ready to <unk> to you with interest ."
let me summarize .
i told you about four techniques that <unk> the problem of <unk> -- <unk> them will <unk> the <unk> alternatives ; make it real ; we can <unk> -- we can <unk> more than more categories ; on complexity .
"each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to give you today is to help you to help the opportunities -- good for them , you can use for themselves , well for the people you , the service you &apos;re providing ."
because i think the key to the best <unk> is that you &apos;re <unk> with the <unk> .
"and the more we choose to pick up the more , the better we will be able to practice the art of the decision ."
thank you .
"<unk> . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> on youtube . i look at <unk> ."
that &apos;s true .
"today , we want to talk about how videos are <unk> , and then , why it &apos;s important ."
"we all want stars to be -- so many <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- when i was young , it seemed to be so <unk> ."
"but web gives you that we can all of our creative <unk> , <unk> <unk> , we can be <unk> famous in part of the culture of our world ."
every single one of you could be famous on the internet to the next <unk> .
"but with youtube , more than 48 hours of video are <unk> ."
"again , a <unk> percentage will ever look at <unk> and will see thousands of times and so on cultural moment ."
so how does that work ?
"three things : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected ."
"well , let &apos;s do ."
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
"<unk> , <unk> !"
"last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> this video that he had shot in the house in the country in <unk> ."
"in 2010 , it was <unk> million times ."
this graph shows how it looked like the video last summer first time was <unk> .
"actually , <unk> didn &apos;t want to make video video ."
he just wanted to share a <unk> .
"because you do that in the same way , when you get to <unk> up to land <unk> ."
he had <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and this video was actually already <unk> in january <unk> .
what &apos;s happening here ?
"so , jimmy <unk> ."
jimmy <unk> <unk> the <unk> who made the video for the last time .
"because <unk> like jimmy <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> us new and interesting things to show you a big audience ."
"<unk> &apos;s <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . you didn &apos;t think we would have this conversation with this conversation ."
rs : <unk> is one of the <unk> video of the year .
it was almost 200 million times a year .
this is what the <unk> looks like .
"it &apos;s like , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; seems to be nothing to be like that ."
what happened on this day ?
"well , it was friday , that &apos;s true ."
"if you know what you &apos;re doing , these other <unk> are also <unk> ."
"but what about that day , that day on friday ?"
"now , <unk> <unk> started writing about it a lot ."
"michael <unk> , for <unk> , who was a <unk> theater , who was a first <unk> about twitter about it ."
"what matters is that a <unk> or a group of <unk> a <unk> of view , with a big audience , <unk> and <unk> the process ."
"then this community of people who shared this big <unk> , and they started talking about it and started talking about it ."
"now there are 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; on youtube ."
there was a <unk> for every single <unk> for every single day .
"unlike the 20th century , the community is the community of the community of becoming part of this phenomenon , either by <unk> it or something new ."
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is animation and music in <unk> .
"that &apos;s it , just very simple ."
this year was almost 50 million times before .
"and if you keep it up for crazy , you know that there &apos;s a <unk> that was <unk> for four million times ."
even cats are looking at this video .
cats are looking at cats watching this video .
the important thing is that creativity is in the <unk> and <unk> .
there were <unk> .
somebody made a <unk> version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> <unk> from the ground that made it a little bit of a joke to something that we can all participate in .
"now today , we don &apos;t just find <unk> of something , we do with ."
"who could have that all of this , you know ?"
"who would have <unk> <unk> , or rebecca , or <unk> <unk> ?"
"what are the <unk> that they can write in their writing , in which they &apos;re doing ."
"in a world where every minute <unk> is going to be <unk> , it can only <unk> and <unk> <unk> like the video i &apos;ve talked about ."
"i &apos;m not interested in giving me a very <unk> when i was told to say that this great video , i &apos;d look at this guy in new york with <unk> for <unk> <unk> ."
"i got a <unk> because i &apos;m not <unk> on the <unk> , but often there &apos;s a <unk> that won &apos;t let a <unk> go on the <unk> ."
"so that was quite surprising and <unk> , <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> idea , and his argument five million times looked ."
this approach is true for everything that we &apos;re creative .
and that &apos;s all of us to get a big question .
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
"<unk> , creative <unk> , completely <unk> , are the <unk> of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to and in the audience of <unk> ."
"as i said , one of the biggest stars in the world -- <unk> <unk> -- made his beginning with youtube ."
nobody has to give your ideas of green light .
and today we are all feeling as <unk> of our <unk> culture .
"and these are not the <unk> of the old media and they &apos;re not going to make them be barely about the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future ."
thank you .
"how can i talk about three minutes about women &apos;s <unk> , and how the amazing <unk> of this <unk> <unk> in the life of a <unk> , when she was in <unk> , over 30 years ago , her mother and her mother &apos;s <unk> , and her <unk> , she can she <unk> , in her little"
the story is still not over .
"it &apos;s a <unk> , which is still <unk> ."
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who <unk> his <unk> .
"he &apos;s a <unk> , a writer , a man whose whole life of life &apos;s own hope of unity and freedom of its home was <unk> ."
"let him go to the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> , as he has to <unk> that his life had to be a single <unk> ."
"the words , so long of his friends , now <unk> his friends ."
he moved back to the silence .
"he died , broken through the story ."
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i &apos;ve never <unk> it .
but our lives are so much more than our <unk> .
my grandmother never forget about his life .
"i had to worry about that it wasn &apos;t <unk> , and it was my job to learn that the story was not trying to <unk> us , but we &apos;ve been out of it ."
the next <unk> <unk> shows how a boat in the early <unk> <unk> on lake <unk> .
"my mother was 18 , when her father died -- already in an <unk> marriage , already with two little girls ."
"for them , their lives had a job : the <unk> of their family and a new life in australia ."
it was completely <unk> that it could <unk> .
"after a <unk> and <unk> <unk> , a boat <unk> <unk> to the lake , as <unk> <unk> ."
all adults were aware of the risks .
"the biggest fear had <unk> them , <unk> and death ."
"as most adults on the boat , my mother had a little <unk> in her ."
"and when i had my sister , my sister had only my sister and i would <unk> them ."
"my first <unk> is from this boat -- the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of each wave on the <unk> , the <unk> and empty horizon ."
"i don &apos;t remember the <unk> that many times came from , but from the <unk> of the men on our boat were on our boat , or at the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , the six hours didn &apos;t want to start ."
"but i remember the lights of the <unk> coast of <unk> coast , and the young man , the <unk> and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the men of a <unk> ."
no apple ever <unk> again .
"after three months in a refugee camp , we <unk> in <unk> ."
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations building together a new life .
"we <unk> in <unk> , one of the very <unk> <unk> that &apos;s made of the population of <unk> ."
"unlike the <unk> <unk> , their existence was completely unknown to me , there was no <unk> in <unk> ."
the <unk> from the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> <unk> <unk> were <unk> between people who had a thing in common .
"my mother worked on farms , and then on a <unk> <unk> , in a <unk> , six days , <unk> layers ."
they kind of <unk> their time to find english and <unk> .
we were poor .
"every dollar has been given , and it was given to english and mathematics <unk> , no matter what we had to do for it , and most of the new things that came out of the second ."
"two <unk> for school , each one to <unk> the holes in the other ."
"a <unk> to the <unk> , because they had to do six years ."
"and there were rare <unk> of &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and there and there &apos;s <unk> : &quot; <unk> , go home . &quot;"
where &apos;s home ?
something <unk> into me .
"there was a meeting of the <unk> and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;ll go out of the path . &quot;"
"my mother , my sister and i &apos;m in the same bed ."
"my mother was <unk> every night , but we were telling each other from our day , and we heard the movements of our grandmother &apos;s <unk> ."
my mother was <unk> from the boat .
"and it was my job to stay in every night until they came , so that i could bring it back ."
"they took a <unk> , and then they did a <unk> and they did a business ."
"and the women came up with their stories over men who didn &apos;t get <unk> , angry and <unk> and <unk> kids , caught two worlds between two worlds ."
<unk> and <unk> were looking for <unk> .
centers were built .
i lived in <unk> .
"in one , i was the classic student student , who <unk> <unk> to themselves ."
"the other thing i &apos;ve been involved in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of violence , the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> ."
but so many of us got to help over the years .
and for that help i &apos;ve been given in the last year as a young <unk> of the year .
"and i was <unk> by a <unk> to the next <unk> , and the <unk> did not fit together ."
"<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , was now <unk> <unk> , refugee refugee , and social <unk> , who was invited to speak to the talks that she never heard , and in <unk> , whose existence they could never imagine ."
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
"i was going to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of life of a <unk> <unk> -- a mother and two daughters , who had been <unk> every day as 20 years , as she had to tell the stories of her stories , and we had three and three ."
"i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that ."
and she reminded me that i was so old when they had the boat when we had the boat .
no was never an opportunity .
"&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and don &apos;t what you &apos;re not . &quot;"
"so i talked about <unk> and training , and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> ."
"and the more <unk> i spoke , the more i should tell ."
"i met people in all <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , lived to the limits of the limits ."
"and even though i had that close , i realized that i couldn &apos;t <unk> a career in law ."
there was another <unk> .
"and i realized that at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> in the picture and not just right , but something for you to be grateful , maybe a gift of the <unk> ."
"because <unk> can lead to collapse so easily collapse , can mean that easy to make the <unk> of the environment ."
"i &apos;ve gone up enough to know from my <unk> to know that , <unk> the world , but not as you can do it ."
possibilities that didn &apos;t have been allowed to have been <unk> .
"there was a <unk> optimism , an <unk> optimism optimism , a strange <unk> of humility and the <unk> ."
so i <unk> my gut feeling .
"i collected a little team of people to me , for the <unk> , &quot; not a <unk> challenge ."
we didn &apos;t have a <unk> for a year .
"at the end of a <unk> , i <unk> a huge <unk> soup that we shared ."
we were working until the night .
"most of our ideas were crazy , but they were a few <unk> , and we managed to get the <unk> ."
i met the decision to pull in the united states .
just after a journey there .
my gut <unk> .
"three months later , i was moved to home and the adventure ."
"before i talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother ."
"she grew up at a time in the <unk> , the social norm and the local person had <unk> the most important person ."
the life had not changed since centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
"by 17 , she was <unk> the second woman to speak by her mother , her mother ."
"without the <unk> of her husband , she <unk> for a <unk> , and she <unk> to the court in her own case , and one more <unk> <unk> , when she won ."
&quot; no &quot; <unk> is <unk> .
"i just took a <unk> in sydney , when she died , 1,000 miles away in <unk> ."
i looked through the <unk> and i looked at the other side .
i knew she had come to <unk> .
my mother was a couple minutes after that .
"a few days later , we went to <unk> in a buddhist <unk> and sat around her face ."
we told their stories and their stories that we were still at their .
"and in <unk> , the <unk> came and said , he had to close the stick ."
my mother asked us to <unk> her hand .
"she asked the <unk> , &quot; why is her hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;"
"&quot; because she &apos;s going to hold this morning , &quot; he said ."
&quot; you didn &apos;t have them . &quot;
"if there &apos;s a band of our family , it &apos;s all over the women ."
"you see who we were <unk> and how life <unk> us , we can now see that the men who would have come to live in our lives , and we had the <unk> in the <unk> ."
the <unk> would have been too simple .
"now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i think i &apos;d be on the boat ."
who would ever wish ?
"yes , i was afraid of <unk> , which is <unk> ."
"can i give you a <unk> in your life , the <unk> of all the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the whole horizon , which is nothing about nothing ?"
i don &apos;t know .
"but if i could give this , and i could make sure it would be safe , i would do it ."
"and then <unk> mother &apos;s here in the fourth , or fifth series ."
i &apos;m here to share with you my photography .
is it photography ?
"because of course , that &apos;s a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera ."
"and yet , my interest in photography , when i received my first digital camera , at age 15 ."
"i <unk> it with my former <unk> , but it was a little different , but when the camera was the process of planning , in planning ."
"and when you end up with a camera , you end up with a camera , if you &apos;re <unk> the <unk> ."
"so for me , photography seemed to go on to the right place at the right time ."
i thought everybody could .
"so i wanted to create something else , something that starts when the process is <unk> ."
photos like this : a site along a lot of <unk> street .
but it has an unexpected <unk> .
"and yet , a <unk> level ."
"or photos like these -- <unk> and <unk> and <unk> at the same time , but all with the shared goal , to keep a <unk> level ."
"if i say reality , my <unk> ."
"because of course , she &apos;s not something that you really can <unk> , but i always want to make it look like this , as if you could have that , on a photograph ."
photos you have to think about a short moment to figure out the trick .
"so , it &apos;s more about <unk> , an idea of <unk> , as a moment ."
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
and is it about the detail or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what is the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
"but at the end of all , it &apos;s about how we &apos;re going to interpret the world , and how they &apos;re made on a <unk> area ."
"it &apos;s not about what is realistic , but what we &apos;re going to do for realistic ."
so i think the <unk> are very simple .
"i see them as a <unk> of reality , where you can take pieces of pieces and put together to create an alternative reality ."
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three <unk> physical objects that we can identify in a three-dimensional world .
"but in a certain way , they can combine something that looks still like it could exist as if it could exist ."
but at the same time we know that this is not possible .
"so we &apos;re <unk> our brains , because our brains are just not just saying that it doesn &apos;t really make sense ."
and i see the same process of <unk> images .
it &apos;s really just about putting different <unk> .
"so the things that make a picture realistic , i think , are the things that we don &apos;t think about are the things that are around us in our lives ."
"but when we combine photos , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because they just look somehow wrong ."
so i would say that there are three simple rules to do that to make a rather than a rather than a rather than a result .
"as you can see , these are not three special images ."
but <unk> can create something special like this .
so the first rule is that <unk> gave photos the same perspective .
"second , <unk> <unk> gave photos the same <unk> ."
and these two images meet these <unk> -- from the same height and the same <unk> .
"third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to <unk> where the individual images start and end by connecting them ."
it &apos;s impossible to say how the picture was actually <unk> .
"so , by <unk> , contrast to the <unk> of the individual images , <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> colors and <unk> , we can take the boundaries between the different images and let them look like a single picture , even a single picture ."
here &apos;s another example .
"you might think that &apos;s just a <unk> , and the bottom part was <unk> ."
this picture is actually completely <unk> out of photos of different places .
"i personally personally believe that it &apos;s easier to create a place when you can find a place , because you don &apos;t have to go to <unk> with ideas in your mind ."
but it requires a lot of planning .
"and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed several months to plan them to find different places , the different places for the <unk> ."
"for example , the fish had been taken on a <unk> ."
the <unk> is from another place .
the <unk> is from a <unk> .
"and yes , i even put the house up on the <unk> island to make it look ."
"so to make an incredibly instrument , it &apos;s going from me to planning ."
"i always start with a <unk> , an idea ."
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s a piece of <unk> very well .
"and if you do good images , the result can be pretty nice , and it &apos;s pretty realistic ."
"so , they &apos;re all the tools there , and the only thing we &apos;re <unk> is our imagination ."
thank you .
i &apos;d like to <unk> you about why so many electronic <unk> would have failed .
and i think that the most important thing is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve <unk> at the <unk> was a <unk> .
"and they &apos;re not going to do scientifically scientifically -- they &apos;re taking a cup of coffee or tea and ask the patient , families , &quot; how about it ?"
how can we help you ? &quot;
"and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of you -- maybe most of the electronic <unk> , because we stopped <unk> ."
this is my <unk> . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
"it has a button , it &apos;s out ."
and every morning i <unk> it .
"and yes , i have a task , as you might recognize ."
i &apos;ve got my job with 95 <unk> .
"it just works : every time i <unk> on the <unk> , you also <unk> my data to google health ."
"and they &apos;re also <unk> by my <unk> <unk> so that he can see where my <unk> is , not just in the moment that i &apos;m going to support for a <unk> , but also with a look at the past ."
but there &apos;s something else .
"maybe you &apos;re familiar with it , i have over 4,000 <unk> on twitter ."
"so every morning i &apos;m going to talk to my <unk> and people , and people already talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; for a little <unk> , just a little bit of <unk> today . &quot;"
"but this is the <unk> , which can happen because this is the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients , because that could be used to <unk> <unk> , or could it <unk> patients the <unk> ."
"but it could also be used to get people from their <unk> , and to get them to play , in some way , to play with some kind of play , to control their health ."
and this is a <unk> week coming into the market .
and this little <unk> will give you a iphone or something like that .
and it will allow people to measure their <unk> from home to their doctor and share it with others for something more than 100 dollars .
"and at that point , the patients come to the game , they can &apos;t just take over the course of the use , we can also help take away from their health ship , the challenges that are <unk> and <unk> , and the demand of the <unk> ."
"so , you can do the ways that are easy to use and start with this on the patient to <unk> ."
"and that can do it by these methods , but also by <unk> ."
"and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you a short video ."
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all the <unk> are around <unk> .
we know one more thing where all the <unk> are .
"and sure , we can find <unk> ."
but where would the next <unk> to help this patient ?
"we &apos;ve got <unk> , and no one knew it ."
nobody knew where the next <unk> <unk> was at the moment .
so what did we do ? we did <unk> in the <unk> .
"we &apos;ve got a website , and we have a <unk> , and we asked a <unk> , &quot; if you can see us , please where he &apos;s when he &apos;s on , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s in <unk> , of course , in <unk> ."
"and over 10,000 <unk> , we &apos;ve been <unk> into the <unk> ."
the next step was to find apps for this .
and we designed a <unk> .
"we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> <unk> , <unk> reality to find these <unk> ."
"and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and you can use somebody , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks you can see the next <unk> to save life ."
"and today we don &apos;t want to just do this as a <unk> as a product called it , but also <unk> ."
and we want to bring this to global level .
"and we ask our colleagues all around the world , from other universities , to help us to behave in the way that <unk> <unk> to <unk> these <unk> around the world ."
"and if you &apos;re on <unk> and somebody , it &apos;s your own <unk> or anyone else , you can find a <unk> ."
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies all over the world help us help in the <unk> of these <unk> .
"these might be <unk> , or for example , just to make sure that the <unk> is still <unk> at the point ."
"please help us and try to improve health , not just in the hand , not to take your hand ."
thank you .
i &apos;m going to tell you about <unk> discoveries today .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants to make a difference in the environment by doing it .
... <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
oh . one moment .
it may take a little bit to it .
now -- we can just get that out of it -- i &apos;m going to <unk> the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
"oh , my time is already over ?"
okay . thank you .
"so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year and work in a environment and work in a environment that really is so much of what they &apos;re going to have in government ."
"the program is called &quot; code for <unk> , &quot; and it &apos;s a bit like the <unk> for <unk> ."
"we choose a couple of <unk> , and we &apos;re working with <unk> ."
"instead of sending them to the third world , we send them into <unk> ."
"and they developed a great apps , working with <unk> <unk> ."
but what they really do is show what is possible today .
so they &apos;re making <unk> .
<unk> is a <unk> in the city of boston .
"this looks like he &apos;s looking for a <unk> , but what he really <unk> , is somebody who <unk> him when he &apos;s <unk> , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at the <unk> of the snow when he &apos;s a <unk> snow ."
how did he look for this particular kind of help ?
we had a team of <unk> in boston with the code for code for the program .
"they were there in the <unk> , and it has been a lot of <unk> ."
and they realized that the city never <unk> that fire .
"but a <unk> <unk> , a man named <unk> <unk> , still noticed another and that was that the <unk> <unk> were <unk> <unk> <unk> , right before these parts ."
"so he did what everyone was doing good , he wrote an app ."
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can fire a fire .
you <unk> to <unk> it <unk> <unk> when it <unk> .
"if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first <unk> ."
"if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can give you a <unk> ."
so there &apos;s a nice little <unk> .
this is a <unk> little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that wrote in the last year .
but she does something not do a different <unk> .
they become <unk> .
"there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who saw that he could use this app , not for snow , but for the citizens to <unk> ."
"it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but people <unk> the batteries ."
so he got the citizens to test them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to clean the <unk> <unk> .
"and chicago has just <unk> it , so people <unk> the <unk> when it <unk> ."
"we know about nine cities , planning to use this app ."
"and she <unk> <unk> , of course , <unk> ."
"if you know something about <unk> , you know that it doesn &apos;t usually run ."
the <unk> of software takes a couple of years .
"we had a team that worked last year in boston , in boston , for the three and a half months ."
it was a way to figure out what parents are able to find out what the real public school is for their children .
"we &apos;ve been told later that when it was going to go about the normal <unk> , it would take over two years and it would have been spending over two million dollars ."
and that &apos;s not even nothing .
"there &apos;s a project in the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> for two billion dollars , which has been <unk> , and it doesn &apos;t work ."
and there &apos;s projects like this on the government .
"so , an app that is written in a few days , and then spread from <unk> is a kind of <unk> in the <unk> institution of the government ."
"it turns out how the government could work better -- not more like a <unk> company , how many people think they should think ."
"and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself ."
"and that means free access , which means open and productive ."
and that &apos;s important .
"but more importantly , that is a new generation , which is the problem of <unk> <unk> -- not as the problem of <unk> institution , but as a problem of <unk> <unk> ."
"and this is a very good <unk> , because it turns out that we are very good at <unk> with digital technology ."
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools we need to <unk> things together .
"it &apos;s not just &quot; code for <unk> , &quot; there are hundreds of people in the entire country who are up and <unk> and writing , every day in their own communities ."
they have not given government .
"they &apos;re <unk> <unk> with their <unk> , but they don &apos;t <unk> about it , they repair it ."
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
"and that &apos;s when you all get your feelings about politics and the <unk> and all the other things that we &apos;re really <unk> about is government , in the core , in the &apos; 90s , we can &apos;t do the <unk> of tim , what we do . &quot;"
"today , a lot of people who have given government ."
"and if you &apos;re one of those people , please , you know , because you &apos;re changing ."
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
"and the government finally <unk> their power out of us -- <unk> to you , &quot; we &apos;re going to think of the people ? &quot; -- how do we think about it , how is that change ?"
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
"and as many people , i thought that there was a government doing everything about being in office ."
"now after two years , i &apos;m going to leave the conclusion that it &apos;s about everything that &apos;s going to go on to <unk> ."
this is the <unk> for service and information .
you usually get out there when you &apos;re in your city .
"if you have ever a chance to work in your <unk> <unk> , like our <unk> scott , as part of the program -- in fact , do that you will see that people will see that there &apos;s a lot of different <unk> of them , of different problems ."
so scott gets this <unk> .
he <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
"and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can just open all the doors to your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is <unk> ? &quot;"
and that worked . for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
boston has not only a <unk> .
"it has an app , an app , <unk> , called <unk> <unk> ."
we don &apos;t write this app .
this is the work of very smart people in the office of new urban urban urban <unk> .
one day -- this is a <unk> report -- this was in the <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t say if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens to the <unk> <unk> is something different .
scott <unk> to human being .
"but in the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s all public , so that everybody can see it ."
"and in this case , it was a <unk> ."
"and the next post that we get <unk> , &quot; i went over there , and i found the <unk> behind the house ."
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
and the <unk> <unk> on the side .
"good night , <unk> <unk> . &quot;"
pretty simple .
this is great . here &apos;s the digital <unk> .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is to get in <unk> .
but it &apos;s also an <unk> example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily necessarily necessarily have a <unk> definition of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help .
"a citizen helped a different citizens , but government was playing a central role here ."
they <unk> them with these two people .
"and you could have them with government <unk> when they needed that , but it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> is a way to <unk> <unk> alternative and <unk> alternative services ."
"if a <unk> of the other , we can <unk> our communities ."
"we call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money ."
one of the most important things is that we need to think about it is that government is not the same as politics .
"and most people understand this , but they believe that one of the <unk> of the others ."
that our contribution to the system is to choose .
"how often do we <unk> a political leaders -- and sometimes we have used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we <unk> back and we expect that government <unk> our values and then <unk> our values , and then our values ."
"that &apos;s because the government is like a further ocean , and politics , that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> ."
"and what &apos;s below is what we call it , of course ."
and we use this word with <unk> .
"but it &apos;s this <unk> that we have , that one thing that we have , and for which we pay , something that &apos;s going to work against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves ."
people seem to think politics is sexy .
"if we want to make this institution for us , we need to make it sexy ."
because that &apos;s where the real focus is .
we need to get to the <unk> of government .
so the <unk> has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of <unk> citizens that wrote a very <unk> <unk> report that &apos;s a answer to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
"that &apos;s not the politically active , that &apos;s <unk> ."
"well , for those of us who have given government , it &apos;s time to think about the world we want to leave our children ."
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really think we have to achieve what we need to do without improving the institution that can be <unk> on all of us ?
"a government is absolutely necessary , but the <unk> needs to be <unk> ."
"the good news is that technology can make it possible , the function of government is fundamentally <unk> in a way that can actually reach something to society ."
"and there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the <unk> internet , and the one that &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you have to build the right systems ."
"now the <unk> of our <unk> is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you are ."
this is a generation that grew up with her voice as granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this battle that we &apos;re all fighting to talk about who they &apos;re all allowed to talk about .
"you can <unk> your opinion to every channel to every time , and you do it ."
"so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of the government , you don &apos;t care about using your voices ."
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the work of government .
and that apps <unk> our hands to improve our communities .
"this could be a fire <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> with a <unk> <unk> ."
"and sure we could have <unk> that fire all the time , and many people do that ."
"but these apps are like little digital <unk> that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government who are paying taxes and pay ."
we are more than we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the u.k.
"so the question i &apos;ve got to ask for you here : if we &apos;re about the big , important things that we have to do together , we &apos;re just going to be a lot of voices , or will we &apos;ll also be a lot of hands ?"
thank you .
"usually my role is to explain how <unk> the new technologies that are <unk> , and i thought i was under here , because i was here with friends , i would really try to tell you what i was going on , and i really try and look back ."
i &apos;ll start by showing you a single slide .
... you could just show the slide up .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve chosen from my <unk> .
"it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but it &apos;s about the <unk> form ."
this slide shows the data from which we &apos;re talking about to the performance of <unk> processors about the performance of a <unk> <unk> .
"what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like <unk> others , which we often <unk> in our field , is a kind of a <unk> curve ."
"in other words , every step here is the <unk> in the <unk> ."
and this is a <unk> that we have to use this kind of scale on <unk> curves in the field .
something very <unk> happened here .
so this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
"so , if you could <unk> the light again ."
"another thing that &apos;s more <unk> , because i &apos;m going to draw something like paper here ."
"now , why do we draw <unk> in technology in <unk> curves ?"
"the reason for that is , if i was going to draw on a normal curve , where we say , this is the <unk> , so the <unk> of a kind of act here , which is a <unk> of technology that i want to be a <unk> ."
and then the <unk> look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
"now , if i want to <unk> another technology , we &apos;ll say a <unk> , then that would <unk> the <unk> , in a flat line , in a flat line ."
"but if something like this , then the <unk> changes ."
"so if the <unk> would <unk> as fast as the <unk> , then we could <unk> into a <unk> and <unk> in 30 seconds , we would be in <unk> ."
but it &apos;s not going to do that fast .
"and that was still in the history of the <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , through which the <unk> will increase all the years of exponential growth ."
"the question i want to ask you now is , if you look at these <unk> curves , you don &apos;t go for the <unk> ."
it &apos;s not possible that everything is always forever and forever as fast as it is .
there are two ways .
"either it will be a classic <unk> like this , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here ."
that &apos;s it in about something .
"now , i &apos;m <unk> , so i think , i think , in the way that &apos;s going to happen ."
"that &apos;s really what that means , we &apos;re right here in the right now in a transition ."
"we &apos;re here in this line , in a transition from the world to the past , to a new kind of world ."
"so the question i want to ask , and i also often think about it is how this new world will be likely ?"
what is this new state that <unk> the world .
"because the transition seems to be very , very <unk> when you &apos;re in the middle ."
"when i was another kid , there was a child somewhere in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 ."
"now we have a conference here where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still still in 2000 ."
we don &apos;t go .
"so in other words , the future is a year of <unk> since i &apos;ve been in this world ."
i think the reason is that we realize something is going to be happening .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
"and we know that it &apos;s just doesn &apos;t make sense of being 30 or 50 years in the future , because everything is going to be so different from what we &apos;re doing now is simply not a sense of power ."
"i want to talk about what that could be , that transition in the moment we &apos;re at the moment ."
"so to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have technology to do with the computer or computers ."
"because i think to really understand this , we need to go back and look at the thing on a <unk> <unk> ."
and that &apos;s what i want to look at in the <unk> of life .
i think the big thing makes sense when you &apos;re <unk> it into some <unk> .
"so let &apos;s go back and that &apos;s <unk> billion years , and the earth was a big , <unk> with lots of chemicals ."
"now , if you were in the way that these chemicals were organized , we have a pretty good picture of how they <unk> it ."
"i also think there &apos;s theories that are starting to understand how it has started with <unk> , but i &apos;ll tell you a <unk> story about what &apos;s about that time , that at that time , small oil <unk> , which is different chemicals in chemicals ."
some of these oil oil <unk> a very special combination of chemicals that <unk> you to <unk> other chemicals from <unk> and grow to grow .
"all of those were , started <unk> ."
these little oil were <unk> in the senses .
"but the oil were not about the oil oil in today , because each of them was just a little , <unk> recipe for chemicals ."
"and every time it <unk> up , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is <unk> ."
so each <unk> was a little bit different .
"in fact , the <unk> that had a <unk> of growth of the growth of growth , faster than other and more <unk> and more chemicals and shared it faster ."
so these <unk> <unk> to survive longer and they <unk> themselves in <unk> .
"so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting when these <unk> is learned about <unk> ."
"there &apos;s a kind of thing that we don &apos;t really understand , that <unk> have the ability to <unk> information , information ."
"they &apos;ve learned to <unk> the recipe of the cell as information , and it &apos;s in a certain chemical form that we call dna ."
"in other words , they found a way to do that , <unk> <unk> , which allowed them to <unk> <unk> so that this information could be <unk> and <unk> ."
and the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information came to <unk> over the time of <unk> billion years that it was happening in which it was the same .
"in fact , the recipe for us is that our genes , our genes , from the same code and the same <unk> ."
and every living organism uses the same letters and the same code .
"we &apos;re <unk> that we can only write about this code , even in the code ."
and i have 100 <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> that i &apos;m trying to keep out in the airports of <unk> .
"it &apos;s in it -- what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use to the <unk> -- and i &apos;ve written my <unk> on a piece of dna dna , and it &apos;s a 10 <unk> <unk> ."
"so , if someone &apos;s a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody in the world , and it &apos;s right here ."
"i would have been a <unk> , i would have written it on a virus and put it into the room ."
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna <unk> of dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
"but then another one happened , very interesting , very interesting , where things were completely different , and they started to communicate these cells , and they started to communicate so that communities have come from cells ."
"i don &apos;t know if you knew it , but bacteria can actually <unk> their dna ."
"that &apos;s why , for example , the <unk> of antibiotics , is growing ."
"some bacteria found how they can <unk> themselves from <unk> , and they &apos;ve written that information together with other bacteria in the dna , and we &apos;ve now written lots of bacteria that are <unk> on <unk> , because the bacteria are <unk> ."
now this communication allowed the reasons of communities that were in a sense of the same boat ; they were <unk> .
"so they &apos;ve had either survive , or they went under . that meant that if a community has been successful , all the individuals have been <unk> from the community and <unk> again and <unk> ."
"the <unk> is there , where these communities are so close to the way that they &apos;re determined to write the recipe for the whole community in a <unk> to the dna ."
"and the next interesting phase , it took about another billion years ."
"at that point we have <unk> communities , many <unk> communities , which together <unk> together as individual organism ."
"in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community ."
we have a lot of cells that are not <unk> on themselves .
"your skin cells are useless without <unk> , <unk> , brain cells and so forth ."
"so these communities started to develop so that the level that the evolution was <unk> not longer the individual cell , but the whole <unk> that we call the organism ."
the next step is now in the communities .
the <unk> started to <unk> information again .
"and they developed special structures that did something else , as to process information within the organism ."
and these are the <unk> structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that have built these <unk> .
"they started to train specialists within the community , special structures that were responsible for learning , and to <unk> of information ."
and this was the brain and the nervous system of this community .
this gave you a <unk> advantage .
"because at that point , an individual -- learning is now in the period of a species of a lifetime , rather than that <unk> of this evolutionary period ."
"so , one organism could learn , for example , a certain <unk> didn &apos;t eat because they made bad <unk> and made it bad , the last time he had <unk> them ."
"this could happen within the lifetime of a organism , whereas hundreds of years , hundreds of years , where this information was needed to be learned from information , the individuals who had to die because of this <unk> had no <unk> yet ."
"so the nervous system has <unk> the <unk> using this particular <unk> , because evolution could now happen within a <unk> process ."
it could be <unk> within a <unk> .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate <unk> .
"so , for example , the <unk> of us familiar with this <unk> version is human language ."
but it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
"i have a very <unk> , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head ."
"i &apos;m sitting here and basically <unk> <unk> <unk> from me to hope that there &apos;s a similar idea of <unk> in <unk> , creating a certain sense of my original idea ."
"so we take something very complicated , we put it into <unk> , and we take a sequence of <unk> , and we create something very complicated in the heads of others ."
so this allows us to work back as a <unk> organism .
"and what we actually did , we , the humanity , is we started to start <unk> ."
"we &apos;re going through the same steps that have <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> of our methods we use , as we <unk> data , <unk> it ."
the invention of language was a small step in this direction .
"<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> , and so on our <unk> are <unk> to build all of our community in our community to <unk> this information ."
"and it connects us all together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and it &apos;s capable of developing faster than we &apos;ve been ."
"so , today , evolution can happen in the <unk> of <unk> ."
"you &apos;ve seen <unk> little <unk> where he &apos;s shown in a little bit of evolution in the <unk> program , right out of your eyes ."
so we &apos;ve <unk> the <unk> again .
"the first steps of history i &apos;ve told you , <unk> a billion years per piece ."
"the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , <unk> a few hundred million years ."
"then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , <unk> less than a million years ."
"and these next steps , like electronics , are very few decades to take ."
"the process of <unk> itself , and so i think it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> is the word for it -- if something <unk> its <unk> ."
"the more it changes , the faster it changes ."
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that lives itself .
"i live <unk> from building computers , and i know that i use the <unk> that i use to build computers , couldn &apos;t use without the recently <unk> in the <unk> ."
"my current activity is about designing objects like such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible to design this in traditional sense ."
i don &apos;t know what every single <unk> in the <unk> .
it has billions of those .
"what i do instead of doing , and what the designers of <unk> <unk> is we think we &apos;re thinking about a certain <unk> , and this machine makes something that makes our skills , and could better <unk> , better than we could ever do it ."
and it makes it partly with methods that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
"one way that &apos;s interesting is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used a lot of time in the last time is evolution itself ."
we <unk> a <unk> in the machine that &apos;s going to happen in the <unk> .
"to call an example , in the <unk> cases , we can create a program that &apos;s developed from <unk> <unk> ."
"we say , &quot; computers , please , please have a hundred million <unk> of <unk> <unk> ."
"now , please <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> , <unk> all programs , and eventually finally , those of the <unk> of my <unk> are . &quot;"
"so in other words , i first want to do what i want ."
"let &apos;s say , i want to <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s a simple example that i used for doing it ."
"so , <unk> programs that can <unk> the <unk> <unk> ."
"of course , the chance of <unk> <unk> is very small by <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> , so they will actually not be the <unk> ."
but one of those of you may be a little bit of lucky <unk> in the right order of the back .
"now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the <unk> that have come to my <unk> at the next ."
"<unk> those <unk> , <unk> the rest ."
now all <unk> that the <unk> who have best <unk> the best <unk> .
"and it &apos;s a way of <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> . &quot;"
"take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the kids are <unk> the <unk> of the two programs ."
"so i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that have created by <unk> programs , which have come closer to the <unk> , as a different one ."
"<unk> , please <unk> this process . &quot;"
they <unk> them again .
<unk> may have some mutations .
and try and do that with another generation .
all of these generations need just a few <unk> .
"and so , i can take a evolution of millions of years away from a computer within less minutes , or in <unk> , some of the cases ."
"finally , i &apos;m able to <unk> programs that can <unk> perfect ."
the fact is that these programs are so much more <unk> than any program i could ever have to write by hand .
"and then , if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work ."
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s <unk> and strange programs .
but they do the job .
"i know and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because you get out of a series of <unk> programs that have done the job ."
because your life was <unk> if they did the job right .
"i <unk> in a <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and he <unk> a map , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at that ."
"there &apos;s this airplane , which is made from <unk> <unk> that work together to make a safer . &apos; does that not make you <unk> ? &quot;"
we know that a <unk> is not a <unk> when it &apos;s too complicated .
"so we start to leave with computers , for a process that &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
he allows things to produce things much more complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it yet .
so <unk> : so that technology is happening .
"we &apos;re using these programs to make a lot faster , so that we can do that <unk> can &apos;t do that much faster ."
so it &apos;s a <unk> .
"it &apos;s going to get faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so <unk> ."
because all of these new technologies that are going to feed itself .
we <unk> .
"we &apos;re at a point where to be <unk> , when <unk> evolved ."
"so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t make the <unk> , which the hell we &apos;re actually in the <unk> ."
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
"but i really think that after us , you &apos;re still going to come ."
i think it &apos;s very <unk> to say that we are the <unk> of evolution .
and i think we all are part of the <unk> of what &apos;s going on next .
"well , the lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to hear now , before i get <unk> ."
"my story is starting right here in <unk> , about two years ago ."
"i was in the <unk> in the desert , with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
we talked about that nothing has changed since the <unk> indian <unk> of the <unk> .
if we were traveling indians back then we were to go into a car and <unk> across the sky .
"now , we &apos;re going to do this with airplanes ."
"at the time when the great indian <unk> <unk> had <unk> , he took a <unk> , <unk> in the soil and water <unk> ."
now we do this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the <unk> that <unk> and magic were replaced by machines .
that made me sad .
i got something scared of technology .
i was afraid i could lose the ability to enjoy that <unk> without the camera and without my friends .
i found that technology should be possible and not kill .
"when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> ."
this piece of 50 years old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
it became a golden access to a world of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and images in my imagination .
i came to see it as i thought our <unk> clocks and cameras were able to dream about .
they were <unk> to become inspired by <unk> .
and so i <unk> myself in the world of technology to see how i could use it to kill magic instead of killing .
and i started to <unk> books .
"when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device that we could connect the readers around the world ."
it can be knowledge about how we think it .
it can know where we are .
"it <unk> images and text , and animation , sounds and touch ."
the <unk> <unk> still <unk> .
but what do we do with that ?
"i just go to <unk> , an interactive app ."
"here is , &quot; your fingers on every light . &quot;"
and so -- here &apos;s &quot; this box is from ... &quot; i write my name .
and it &apos;s made a character in the book .
"and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad <unk> through <unk> -- which i <unk> -- which is really right to me ."
the child in me is really really excited about this as a child .
i &apos;ve talked about magic .
"i don &apos;t mean <unk> and <unk> , but the <unk> of childhood childhood , the ideas that we had all of the children ."
"fireflies in a glass , i always found exciting ."
so you have to <unk> the ipad and the fireflies .
and the light goes through the <unk> book .
another idea that i was fascinated by as a child that can be able to put a whole galaxy in a single <unk> .
and so this is going to be a book and every world that i &apos;m putting here in the magic device .
and this opens up a map .
"<unk> had always maps , but these maps were <unk> ."
this map <unk> and <unk> and it &apos;s <unk> for the rest of the book .
it turns out there &apos;s another book .
i &apos;m going to go in here .
"it &apos;s also important to me to create something that is <unk> , but also very <unk> ."
these are the <unk> .
"we &apos;ve all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?"
"the poor <unk> were caught in <unk> in <unk> , in an old <unk> book ."
"and we bring them back , in a contemporary story , in our children ."
"one story that <unk> with new <unk> , like the <unk> ."
"the theme of the <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids are in their <unk> , sitting in their <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> to ."
"but now with <unk> technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology ."
"in a interaction of the book , you &apos;ll be sent to a search <unk> , you have to go out and turn the camera of the <unk> images of natural objects ."
"as a child , i had <unk> from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ."
so the kids don &apos;t make it more .
this is <unk> <unk> . you need to go out to a chapter of a photograph of a <unk> and <unk> .
in another chapter you have to <unk> a piece of <unk> and <unk> .
so you actually have a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
"a child in london shows the image of a <unk> , and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a <unk> today . &quot;"
"a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkeys . &quot;"
it creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually took .
there &apos;s a variety of ways of magic that <unk> the world and technology .
"the next book we plan to do a interaction with the video that you use , and you see the video of the <unk> , and you see a animation that looks like this , and you see , which is a plant like the house in front ."
there &apos;s a place that <unk> the screen with <unk> .
"you have to do the sound of the <unk> , you <unk> and read the rest of the <unk> ."
we all move into a world where the nature of the technologies of the technology can come and <unk> technology and technology can be <unk> .
we use the energy of the sun .
"we bring our children and we &apos;re closer to the natural world and at the <unk> , fun , and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of history ."
thank you .
this is really an honor to me .
"i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ."
i spend most of my time with the socially <unk> in the <unk> and in places where there are a lot of <unk> .
"here at ted to be here , to hear and hear about how <unk> that is , i &apos;ve given a lot of force ."
"in the short time here , one of me was clear : ted has a identity ."
you can say things that have influence around the world .
"and sometimes , if something comes to ted , it gets a meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have ."
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen a fantastic <unk> .
"i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a <unk> meaning , but the words of a <unk> <unk> are particularly <unk> ."
"as a doctor , you can do good , as a doctor , but you can do more ."
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
"i was <unk> big in a family , a traditional <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> by a <unk> , and this <unk> was my grandmother ."
"she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had the effect ."
she had the last word in every <unk> .
she was also the most <unk> of many <unk> in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia as a <unk> .
it was born by <unk> and the experience of slavery that they were <unk> very strong .
"my grandmother was very <unk> , but she was also <unk> ."
"when i met them as little boy , she came up and <unk> me ."
they were so <unk> that i could barely breathe . then they let me go .
"one or two hours later , when i came to her , she came to me and said , &quot; <unk> , you know , you know , my <unk> ? &quot;"
"and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; no , she would <unk> me again . &quot; if i said , &quot; she said , &quot; i was going to leave me in silence ."
"and they were something that made , you always wanted to be close to your point ."
the only problem was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of your 10 children .
"sometimes , when i was trying to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention ."
my cousins are <unk> around .
"i remember , i have to have been eight or nine , that i went to a morning and went to the living room . all my cousins were walking around ."
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> and <unk> me .
i first thought that this would be a game .
"i looked at them and <unk> , but they saw it very seriously ."
"that &apos;s what 15 or 20 minutes , she <unk> up and came to me and she took me to the hand , and she took me , and she said , &quot; come , &quot; <unk> . &quot; and i have to talk . &quot;"
i remember that when it was yesterday .
i will never forget .
"she took me out and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you have to promise you that you don &apos;t have to be <unk> . &quot;"
"i said , &quot; <unk> , <unk> . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;"
"she sat down , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;"
i &apos;ll never forget that .
"and she said , &quot; you have to <unk> me just three things , <unk> . &quot;"
"i said , &quot; okay , grandmother . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; well , first of all , i &apos;m going to tell you that you will love your mom forever . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise you &apos;re always going to take care of you . &quot;"
"i <unk> my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;"
"and she said , &quot; next to me , you will always do the right thing . &quot; and even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;"
"and i thought , &quot; well , i said , <unk> . i promise it . &quot;"
"and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you need to promise is , &quot; you will never drink . &quot;"
"well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; oh , <unk> . i promise . &quot;"
"i grew up on the country , in the rural , and i have a brother , who &apos;s older , and a year older sister ."
"when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this <unk> beer with <unk> and <unk> my sister and went to the forest ."
we &apos;re just <unk> around the same way .
"then he took a <unk> beer and offered my sister to one , and she took me , and then they <unk> me ."
"i said , &quot; no , no , no . no . no , you &apos;ll do it . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;"
"my brother said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do this , today , we do anything else we do ."
"i had what your sister had what . go , <unk> a beer . &quot;"
"i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do . just do her . &quot;"
my brother <unk> me .
"he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , what &apos;s going on . &quot;"
"and then he looked into my face and he said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not going to do it even <unk> because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;"
"i said , &quot; what are you doing ? &quot;"
"he said , &quot; <unk> <unk> all the <unk> that they are special . &quot;"
i was <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m going to <unk> you a little bit .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
this is perhaps <unk> public .
"i &apos;m 52 years old , and i <unk> that i &apos;ve never <unk> a drop of <unk> ."
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s so radically . i say that because identity means identity is .
"if we create the right way of identity , we can tell people about how to tell us things that they don &apos;t think first ."
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
"of course , my grandmother would tell all their <unk> , they &apos;re very special ."
my grandfather was in prison during the <unk> .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases .
and she believed that this was the themes that we need to take care of .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
"in &apos; &apos; <unk> , <unk> people in <unk> and in prison ."
"today , it &apos;s <unk> million ."
the united states today have the highest <unk> in the world .
"seven million people are <unk> on <unk> , or with <unk> <unk> ."
i think that <unk> have changed our world .
"socially weak and black share of people <unk> and <unk> , because of that change ."
"one of three <unk> black black and 30 is in <unk> , in prison , on <unk> , <unk> and with <unk> <unk> ."
"in urban communities everywhere in the country -- from los angeles over <unk> to washington , <unk> to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of every black young men either either in <unk> , in prison , on <unk> or <unk> , <unk> ."
"but our system is not just being <unk> by questions that have been <unk> with <unk> , it &apos;s also being <unk> by poverty ."
we have a <unk> in this country that you &apos;re getting better when you &apos;re rich and more <unk> than poor and innocent .
"wealth , not <unk> , is affected ."
but we seem to be <unk> with this .
"the politics of fear and anger , we believe that these problems are not our problems ."
we have lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there are some <unk> of these things .
my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to you the right if you &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
"and here in <unk> , <unk> percent of the black population have <unk> lost their right ."
we <unk> that in 10 years the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> will be as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i represent kids .
a lot of my <unk> are very young .
"the united states of america are the only country in the world , the <unk> children in jail for death ."
"in this country , there are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
we &apos;ve been running a lot of the process .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in <unk> .
the question of death is an interesting question .
we think because it has taught us that the real question is that a human being made of a <unk> of crime ?
that &apos;s a very <unk> question .
"but you can also think differently about it , depending on how we see our identity ."
"the other perspective is not : anybody made a crime for death , but is we made it to kill ?"
i think the <unk> .
the death of america is defined by <unk> .
"on nine people we have <unk> , one that we have <unk> for innocent <unk> , and from the <unk> was <unk> ."
an amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent .
i find the <unk> .
"we would never let someone fly with a plane if they could go for nine planes , the <unk> would be ."
"but somehow , we can do this problem , and we can do it ."
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our <unk> .
it &apos;s not our battle .
i &apos;m talking much about these questions .
"i talk about race and the question , whether we have the right to kill ."
"and it &apos;s <unk> because i &apos;m <unk> my students , i &apos;m talking about slavery . i &apos;m talking about slavery ."
"i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time of <unk> , up to the beginning of the <unk> , <unk> ."
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
"but for the <unk> in this country , it was a time of <unk> ."
"in many areas , people had to be scared of <unk> ."
or before bombs .
it was the fear of <unk> that <unk> her life .
"these older people come now and say , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , they talk , they tell people that they should stop to say that we have the first time in the history of history . &quot;"
"they say , &quot; no -- tell the people we grew up with it . &quot;"
"and of course , the terrorism <unk> and decades of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> and ended ."
"and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems ."
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what the importance of our actions have in the historical context .
we are constantly <unk> .
we &apos;re always creating new <unk> and conflict .
"it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not <unk> to approach the process of truth and <unk> ."
"in south africa , people have understood that the <unk> is not to overcome without the willingness to go and to truth ."
"even after the <unk> in rwanda , there were these willingness to go , but not in our country ."
i &apos;ve got some talks in germany about death penalty death .
"it was <unk> , because one of the scientists stood up and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply deeply <unk> to hear them . &quot;"
"he said , &quot; germany , there is no death ."
"and of course , they can never give more in germany . &quot;"
"it was still silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible to kill us again for the <unk> of people ."
"it would be <unk> of us , <unk> and <unk> people . &quot;"
i thought about it .
"as it turned out to live in a world where the german state had <unk> people , especially if there were many jews ."
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
"and yet , in this country here , in the states of the <unk> , we &apos;re going to leave people -- here &apos;s the risk of death , <unk> times higher when the victims is dying , when the disease is black when it is black ."
"and yet , there &apos;s these mental <unk> ."
i think our identity is threatened .
"if we &apos;re not involved in this difficult issues , then the positive and wonderful things are affected ."
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love conversation .
"but eventually , these <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ."
i &apos;m important to combine both .
"because we finally talk about that we need more <unk> , more commitment to more <unk> to be in a complex world ."
"for me , the time is <unk> to think and talk about the poor that are the <unk> that will never be at ted ."
but think in a way that &apos;s in our own lives .
we all have to think of things that we can &apos;t see .
"we do that . so we &apos;re also rational , so we value it ."
"innovation , innovation , and development is not just coming out of our minds ."
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
"it &apos;s the <unk> that i think that i think you &apos;re going to take us , not just to be open to all the <unk> and all the <unk> , but also for the dark and the <unk> ."
"<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politicians , once said ."
"&quot; when we were <unk> against europe , <unk> , we wanted to do anything , but what we needed was hope to be a <unk> , a <unk> , the willingness to be <unk> , sometimes to be <unk> and to be <unk> . &quot;"
and this mental <unk> is the core of what i think is that the <unk> must have <unk> .
"there &apos;s no <unk> of technology and design that allows us to be human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , and <unk> ."
i want to <unk> it . this kind of identity challenges a lot more of us than we don &apos;t think about it .
it will deeply <unk> them .
"as a young lawyer , i <unk> the great privilege to meet pink <unk> ."
"<unk> came back to <unk> , where they had two of their <unk> friends of their elderly women , <unk> <unk> , who had organized <unk> -- an incredible <unk> , virginia , whose white husband , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a white <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ."
"so these women <unk> , and they just <unk> ."
"and then , by <unk> , i said , &quot; <unk> , <unk> <unk> comes to the city . we want to <unk> ."
do you want to listen to <unk> and listen ? &quot;
"and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;"
"i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;"
and i went over and just heard .
"it was so inspiring , so <unk> ."
"one day i sat there , and i heard these women , and after a few hours , <unk> turned to me to come and say , &quot; well , tell me what the initiative is <unk> . &quot;"
what do they try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my <unk> talk .
"i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to do <unk> ."
<unk> want to help people who have been <unk> <unk> .
we want <unk> and discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to <unk> <unk> without <unk> <unk> <unk> for children .
we want to do something about the death of a death .
we want to reduce the number of <unk> .
we want to end <unk> . &quot;
"i gave my <unk> talk , and she looked at me and she said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . <unk> . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; well , that will be very , very tired . &quot;"
"then <unk> woman <unk> to me , <unk> a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so you have to be very , very , very <unk> . &quot;"
and so i think that the <unk> should be <unk> .
"we need to make ways of asking us to get these challenges : these problems , of <unk> ."
"because ultimately , our humanity is <unk> from our humanity ."
i learned a very simple thing in my work .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
that we all are more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for everyone of the planet .
"if someone <unk> , he &apos;s not just a liars ."
"if somebody &apos;s a little <unk> that doesn &apos;t have to tell him , it &apos;s not just a <unk> ."
even who kills someone is not just a <unk> .
"and because that &apos;s like , there &apos;s a fundamental human being that needs to respect the law ."
"i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with security , in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not ."
i don &apos;t think that .
i think that in many places the opposite of poverty is .
"and finally , i think that , even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so <unk> and so <unk> , we &apos;re not measured by our technology , not at the end of the things that we &apos;re developing , not in our <unk> and our minds ."
"finally , a society is not measured as they &apos;re treating their rich and <unk> and privileged to , but as they were <unk> with the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ."
because in this context we &apos;re first to understand the really amazing things that make us .
sometimes i lose the <unk> . one story to end .
sometimes i &apos;m too much .
i &apos;m going to get tired of how we all .
"sometimes these ideas make a <unk> of thinking , in a very important way ."
i represent these kids who have been <unk> to very <unk> .
"i go to <unk> and i &apos;m going to have a <unk> , which is 13 or 14 years old , and the <unk> should be in court ."
"then i ask myself , &quot; how could that happen ? &quot;"
how can a judge <unk> someone into something that he &apos;s not ?
"the judge <unk> <unk> him as adults , but i see a kid ."
"one night , i stayed up for a day , and i thought , if an <unk> can turn into something else , then it must have <unk> ."
"right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> ."
you should have the one that would want .
"and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think i started working on a <unk> ."
"i had a <unk> , poor black young boy as a <unk> ."
"and i started with this <unk> , the <unk> <unk> : &quot; <unk> , my poor , <unk> black <unk> as a high <unk> , white <unk> . &quot;"
"in my <unk> , i explained that <unk> would be the <unk> and the police and <unk> are <unk> ."
"there was a crazy line line about that in this country that &apos;s nothing more <unk> , that there &apos;s only <unk> ."
the next morning i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i had written this crazy <unk> or i had actually written it .
"and to my <unk> , i didn &apos;t just write him , but sent to the court ."
a few months went and i had to forget everything .
"but i decided , i mean , i mean , i have to go to the dish and i have to get that crazy case ."
i went into the car and i was really overwhelmed with it .
so i went to the dish .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard .
"i ended up up from my car , and i went up the staircase ."
"when i <unk> the staircase , there was a older man , <unk> man in the court ."
"when he saw me , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;"
"i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;"
he came to me and <unk> .
then he <unk> me into the <unk> .
"he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;"
"and i have to say , there was the power ."
"it <unk> something very deep into me , identity , the ability to <unk> each individual , to a community , to a perspective of hope ."
"well , i &apos;m <unk> the <unk> ."
and as soon as the judge saw me .
"he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , you &apos;ve asked these crazy <unk> ? &quot;"
"i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss ."
"more people came in , just because they were angry ."
that i had written these crazy things .
<unk> <unk> came in and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
"in the <unk> , the <unk> was full of people who were angry at <unk> languages , about poverty , about inequality ."
and i saw the <unk> on my <unk> .
he looked at the window through the window and could hear it all the <unk> .
he went up and down .
"and finally , this older black man came up with a very <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and sat down directly behind me almost <unk> ."
"ten minutes later , the judge <unk> a <unk> ."
"during the <unk> , a <unk> <unk> came in , which <unk> was in the <unk> ."
this <unk> <unk> over the older black .
"he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;"
"the older man stood up . he saw the <unk> , he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m a <unk> to tell this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal of the eyes . don &apos;t give them the eyes . &quot;"
"i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral <unk> of the universe , but that it <unk> justice ."
"that we are not entirely <unk> as people , as long as we don &apos;t care about human and human rights ."
that our <unk> lives with the survival of every single one .
"that we have our visions of technology and design , with <unk> and creativity , with humanity , for justice and justice ."
"and most of all , i want to see those of you who are looking at this as well , just saying , don &apos;t lose the goal . don &apos;t give you ."
"and you &apos;ve seen a obvious wish of this community , and you &apos;ve heard a <unk> and you can help them and do something ."
what can we do yet ?
"<unk> <unk> : well , there &apos;s all kinds of possibilities ."
"if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring , where it &apos;s about , in fact , a effort of business , something from the <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> to the politics of the <unk> ."
"here , in california , for example , in the next five years , you will have a billion dollars a billion for death penalty <unk> a billion dollars ."
"and yet , <unk> percent of all <unk> don &apos;t end up with a <unk> ."
<unk> percent of all <unk> don &apos;t get in court .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
this <unk> will suggest that money will invest in more <unk> and secure .
i think there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
"and during the last three decades , the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in america ."
this is a lot of times a <unk> of <unk> .
what would you tell someone who believes ?
"now , in fact , the number of <unk> is not very much changed ."
"most of the <unk> in this country , not really found in the class of <unk> instead ."
it was the <unk> helmet against drugs .
so the <unk> are coming up with the <unk> .
we &apos;ve been <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> .
"now we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> that makes people <unk> for <unk> for a <unk> , for the <unk> <unk> good , instead of being <unk> the things that are <unk> the victims ."
"i think we need to do more to help people who have become crime , not less than less ."
and i think that our <unk> <unk> will help not help .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
"<unk> , you really have a <unk> <unk> here ."
they &apos;re an <unk> personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
"am bin laden &apos;s <unk> , a <unk> <unk> ."
two : <unk> <unk> in <unk> . speaker &apos;s three <unk> : king of the police .
four : <unk> <unk> . five . <unk> <unk> .
"six , <unk> <unk> <unk> . 7 : 65 <unk> ."
eight : <unk> . <unk> : <unk> .
different speakers : <unk> . <unk> . <unk> .
recession . <unk> . <unk> . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
"oh , my god ."
"so these are just a few of the <unk> that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it would have been the last six days , or the last six years ."
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative issues because our minds are <unk> at these issues .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
"every second of the day , our senses will start to process more information than our own process of life ."
"and because nothing of us is important as our survival , the first stop for all the information is a part of our <unk> , the <unk> ."
"so the <unk> is our <unk> , our <unk> ."
it <unk> and <unk> the whole information to the <unk> of <unk> from the risk of <unk> in our environment .
"so if we look at the news , we would think of it as to <unk> news ."
"and the old <unk> , &quot; if it <unk> , the demand is very true ."
"now , with all our digital devices that are seven days the week , 24 hours a day , 24 hours of all this negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re <unk> ."
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that it &apos;s always going to be worse .
but it may not be the case .
perhaps that &apos;s the reality .
"maybe the enormous progress we &apos;ve done in the last century has been made by a series of forces , so strong that it will be possible in the next three decades will be able to create a world of <unk> ."
"now , i don &apos;t say that we don &apos;t have big problems -- <unk> , <unk> , water and energy energy -- we have already got ."
"and as humans , we are much better at <unk> problems in very long term , but ultimately , they &apos;re <unk> ."
"so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can <unk> the development ."
"in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has been doubled as doubled , which has <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
child mortality has increased by a <unk> .
"and the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> have <unk> <unk> ."
steve <unk> has shown us that we are now in a very <unk> time in the <unk> .
"and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> has been <unk> in the last 25 years from 80 percent to 80 percent ."
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we keep increasing expectations of our expectations .
we actually <unk> poverty .
"consider that a big deal of americans who live under the <unk> , access to electricity , water , water , <unk> , tv , <unk> , <unk> , cars and cars ."
"the richest <unk> of the last century , the <unk> of the earth , never had any such <unk> ."
"the basis for many of these technologies , and these grow <unk> ."
"my good friend ray <unk> showed us that every <unk> that will be <unk> to the <unk> , on the curve of moore &apos;s law is <unk> , and <unk> <unk> every 12 to 12 months ."
"this is the <unk> <unk> in your <unk> , about a million times less and less than a <unk> <unk> from the &apos; 70s ."
now look at this curve .
that &apos;s moore &apos;s law &apos;s law last hundred years .
notice two things at this curve .
"first , as <unk> &apos;s going to be -- in good times as in bad times , war or peace , depression , depression and <unk> ."
this is the result of <unk> computers that build computers .
they &apos;re <unk> to none of our big problems .
"and despite their <unk> , their <unk> <unk> on the left , it goes up ."
so the <unk> itself <unk> itself .
"and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everyone ."
"&quot; <unk> &quot; , something my friends at <unk> &quot; <unk> , sensors and networks , sensors , 3d robots that allow personal production to <unk> to our planet , <unk> biology , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ."
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> watson at risk of risk ?
that was <unk> .
"i &apos;ve been looking at the <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;ve been looking for the best headlines that i could find ."
"i love this one , &quot; watson <unk> <unk> . &quot;"
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the <unk> of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence would have <unk> to each one of the <unk> .
"four years ago , ray <unk> , and i &apos;m here at ted a new university called <unk> university ."
we bring our students all these technologies to the <unk> focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
"and every year we ask the students , companies , companies and services , services that can live in a decade of people &apos;s lives ."
think about that a group of students today can affect life of billions of people .
"30 years ago , this would have <unk> ."
today we can have dozens of companies that have done this .
"if i think about creating <unk> , then i don &apos;t have a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about making a life full of opportunities ."
it &apos;s about creating <unk> <unk> <unk> .
"<unk> is <unk> , and technology is a resource <unk> ."
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of <unk> to dinner .
"<unk> soldiers got <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> himself ."
"the king of <unk> <unk> , however , was <unk> ."
"and even at that time , the <unk> metal on the planet , <unk> <unk> as gold and ."
this is the reason that the dome of the <unk> of the <unk> was made of .
"even though , <unk> percent of the <unk> is going to get out of <unk> metal ."
it &apos;s <unk> by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology of the <unk> was developed and made so cheap that we use it to use our <unk> .
and then let &apos;s take this analogy to the future .
we think of <unk> today .
"ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet with <unk> more energy than we use a year ."
16 <unk> energy <unk> all the <unk> minutes of <unk> on earth .
"it &apos;s not about <unk> , which is a problem ."
and there &apos;s good news .
"in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , to reduce the cost for <unk> to india 50 percent of the <unk> -- <unk> rupees in 17 rupees ."
the cost of <unk> <unk> is about 50 percent .
"last month , this published a study that shows that , until the end of this decade , in the <unk> areas , <unk> <unk> <unk> per <unk> , will be <unk> at 15 cents in the national average cost ."
"and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;re going to have water in the <unk> ."
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
"do you remember , as carl <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> when it was <unk> , back to earth ?"
he took a <unk> photograph . how did it ?
&quot; a <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered in 70 percent of water .
"yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent , two percent of the <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting to have about <unk> percent of the planet on the planet , but here &apos;s hope ."
"and there &apos;s new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now ."
"it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> ."
"and from a conversation today with dean <unk> , one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , i want to share with you -- he gave me the <unk> -- his <unk> -- his <unk> , which is a <unk> , and many of them ."
"it can produce a thousand <unk> <unk> <unk> per day -- whether it &apos;s <unk> , water , <unk> water , <unk> -- and all that <unk> for less than a <unk> of a <unk> ."
the <unk> of coca-cola has just <unk> a big <unk> with a hundred <unk> in the developing world .
"and if everything is fine , and i &apos;m very <unk> , then coca-cola is going to use this technology to the <unk> countries around the planet ."
this is <unk> innovation that we have today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in <unk> .
"you mean , we &apos;re going to reach the 70 percent of <unk> in the developing world to the end of <unk> in the developing world ."
just remember that a <unk> with a mobile phone in the middle of kenya has a better <unk> than president 25 years ago .
"and if you &apos;re looking at your smartphone on google , you &apos;ve got more access to knowledge and information than president <unk> 15 years ago ."
"they live in a world that has information and communication in <unk> , as nobody would have ever had <unk> ."
"and it &apos;s getting better , the things that you &apos;ve spent and i spent several thousand dollars -- <unk> and photograph , libraries and music , and music , and technology , are now going to be literally <unk> and literally <unk> in their cell phones ."
and the best part is perhaps what we expect in health .
"last month , i had the pleasure of <unk> that so-called &quot; 10 million <unk> x prize &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; ."
"we &apos;re asking teams all over the world , all these technologies are <unk> to connect with one <unk> so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s <unk> with <unk> , you can test <unk> or your <unk> ."
"and to win , the device has to put better diagnosis as a team of doctors ."
"imagine this device in the middle of a country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the staff of the staff ."
"if this device sequenced a <unk> or <unk> <unk> that &apos;s not known , it <unk> the <unk> and <unk> it <unk> a <unk> before it ."
but now the biggest force that we &apos;re going to have is a world of <unk> .
i call it &quot; the <unk> billion . &quot;
the white lines are the population .
we &apos;ve just <unk> the <unk> .
"and by the way , the biggest <unk> is a population of education is a better education and food in the world ."
"in 2010 , we had just connected two billion people online online ."
"by 2020 , we &apos;re growing <unk> from two billion <unk> of <unk> ."
three billion new heads that we never heard before are <unk> to the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what will they consume ? what will you <unk> ?
"and instead of <unk> <unk> , i see one of the biggest economic <unk> of history ."
these people are a couple of dollars that are going to flow into the global economy .
"and they &apos;re going to be <unk> by using the <unk> of the <unk> , and they &apos;re better trained by the <unk> , and by using the opportunity to have the opportunity to be , 3d <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and so much more than ever ."
"so what can be three and three billion growing , healthy , productive members of the <unk> have been bringing us to us ?"
"like it would be a series of new , never <unk> voices before ."
"how would it be that , the <unk> , whatever you are , you &apos;re going to be a voice to make attention and to yourself , to create change , for <unk> ?"
what are these three billion people <unk> ?
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
"one of the things i learned by the x prize is that small teams that are <unk> by <unk> and focus , are able to create extraordinary things , things that could create big , things in the past ."
i want to finish with a story that really <unk> me .
there &apos;s a program that may have known some .
it &apos;s a game called the <unk> .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids can be able to explore how the protein is going to develop .
the <unk> to its behavior is to <unk> the structure and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
so this was a problem for <unk> .
and this game was played by <unk> and so on .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that these people are <unk> better <unk> the proteins as the best <unk> .
"and when these people came and looked at the best <unk> in the world , this was not a <unk> , not a <unk> , it was a man , a woman , a <unk> , a woman who was working as a <unk> and a <unk> in the best <unk> ."
"ladies and gentlemen , what is that incredible trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than we have to do today , to make us a large challenges of our planet ."
we have access to <unk> tools with technology .
we have passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of <unk> .
"and we have three billion new heads that we can work online to <unk> the new challenges , and to do what needs ."
we &apos;re going to expect a couple of extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we have to have something about a <unk> piece of <unk> culture .
"and i think it starts with a <unk> , and i &apos;m a <unk> ."
"and maybe i &apos;m in business as long enough , as i can allow myself to give me a piece of my own wrong <unk> to make this ."
"but before i get to the actual theme of my <unk> , let &apos;s start with a little baseball ."
"hey , why not ?"
we &apos;re the <unk> near and moving to the <unk> .
"we all love baseball , right ?"
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
"&quot; <unk> , &quot; seems to be soon and is about statistics and to use a <unk> baseball team ."
i &apos;m going to get to a <unk> of the one that i hope most of you have heard about .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about 300 when a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that means that the player <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
"that &apos;s called the ball in the <unk> , it &apos;s coming up , and he &apos;s not going to get caught up , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball at the base , it &apos;s not done in time and the <unk> ."
three out of <unk> .
do you know how to call a <unk> in major manifestation of baseball ?
"good , really , maybe a <unk> ."
you know how to call a <unk> ?
that &apos;s someone who &apos;s in the <unk> <unk> .
"<unk> -- like ted <unk> <unk> -- the last major geographic player , who met <unk> over 400 <unk> ."
"let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , which i feel a lot of <unk> or maybe a little bit less about the one that i talked about to you about it ."
let &apos;s have a <unk> and you &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> <unk> whose 400 400 <unk> is in terms of <unk> .
"it &apos;s not like that , right ?"
"suppose they live in a certain area and they have a loved people with <unk> and their <unk> <unk> to a <unk> , whose <unk> is where there &apos;s 200 of <unk> ."
"but , you know what ?"
it &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s on the <unk> .
and it <unk> a <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
"what do you think about the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse , a <unk> , a <unk> , should be a <unk> ?"
"1,000 , very good ."
"the truth is that nobody knows all in medicine , which is a good surgeon or a doctor or a <unk> ."
"what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;ve been <unk> from each of them to me , to be <unk> with the world perfectly ."
"never make a mistake , no one is going to do the details of the details , like this ."
and that &apos;s the message that i took in the <unk> .
i was a <unk> student .
"in high school , a <unk> said that brian <unk> would learn for a <unk> ."
and so it was .
"and i learned in my little <unk> <unk> , in the sisters , <unk> <unk> , <unk> from here ."
i learned everything .
"in my <unk> , i learned the <unk> and <unk> every single <unk> , every branch of every <unk> , which <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ."
i even knew the <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i took more and more .
"and i was good , i was <unk> with <unk> ."
"and i left the <unk> with the impression that i knew everything , and everything , or at least as possible , as close as possible as i could do , that i could make <unk> on the mistakes of mistakes ."
and it <unk> for a time until i met <unk> .
i <unk> on a <unk> here in <unk> when woman <unk> to me in the <unk> of the <unk> .
"so at that point , i was <unk> layer at the <unk> service ."
"and it was my <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> was looking for the <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
and there &apos;s <unk> to my <unk> .
i studied <unk> <unk> and she was in <unk> .
"and when i was doing it , they made <unk> sound ."
"and when i <unk> her chest <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides that told me that she had <unk> <unk> ."
"that &apos;s a state of <unk> in the heart , instead of making the entire blood , you &apos;ll get a part of the <unk> in the <unk> , and it <unk> out , and it <unk> the <unk> came out ."
and that was not a hard diagnosis .
i put them and made me care .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the heart of the heart .
"i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water pills so that she <unk> the liquid ."
"and over a period of a <unk> and two hours , she started feeling better ."
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually did two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my <unk> .
"i didn &apos;t take the <unk> , and i didn &apos;t have what i should call a call with my <unk> to him so that he had a chance to have a picture of his own ."
and he knew he &apos;d been able to get extra information to her .
maybe i did it with <unk> reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
"maybe i wanted to take this as well as well as i &apos;m able to take care of it , that i would be so <unk> and so i would be able to worry about it without my patients without <unk> ."
my <unk> was worse .
"and so that &apos;s what i sent them home , i &apos;m going to be a quiet voice in me , which tried to say , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t do good idea . &quot;"
"in fact , i was so <unk> to the nurse asking me the nurse &apos;s nurse &apos;s day , &quot; do you believe that it &apos;s okay when she goes home ? &quot;"
"and the nurse thought about it , and said in <unk> , &quot; well , i think it &apos;ll be good to go . &quot;"
i remember it as though it was yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and an <unk> and brought it home and brought it home .
and i <unk> back to work .
"the rest of the day , i had this <unk> feeling in my <unk> ."
but i worked on .
"and at the end of the day , i <unk> my stuff , i <unk> the hospital , and i went to <unk> to the car , and i went home to a car when i did something that i didn &apos;t do ."
i went through the <unk> of my way home .
"and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen <unk> after woman , but another three words , and these three words fear that most of the most recent , that i know ."
"other <unk> <unk> the same , but the <unk> is particularly particularly because we &apos;re seeing the patients are just so <unk> ."
the three words <unk> : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients you &apos;d like to go home ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
"so she said , &quot; she said , in this particular <unk> ."
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
"about an hour after that she was <unk> after she had home after i <unk> her home , she <unk> her and the family <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> was <unk> on the <unk> of 50 , the dangerous <unk> ."
they didn &apos;t <unk> and it was blue .
the <unk> <unk> did all the strands .
they gave their <unk> .
they <unk> them to the <unk> .
i was <unk> and <unk> to the inner <unk> .
"and i <unk> these <unk> because they came to <unk> in <unk> , and i <unk> that they were <unk> ."
"and after two , three days , it &apos;s been clear that she would never <unk> again ."
she had no <unk> <unk> <unk> .
your family <unk> .
"and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they <unk> ."
"on the day , they <unk> -- woman <unk> , a woman , a mother and grandmother ."
you say that you &apos;re never <unk> the names .
and that was the first time i learned this .
"the next weeks i made <unk> , and i learned the first time to make shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , not in isolated , not the kind of <unk> of shame you can talk about it because you can &apos;t talk about it ."
"you all know the healthy shame , if you have a secret of the best friend , even though that &apos;s a <unk> on <unk> and then you get caught a friend with it , and you never <unk> my <unk> , if you end up on a <unk> ."
if you <unk> <unk> and you never make the mistakes again .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the <unk> way i &apos;m talking about is that one in the <unk> power .
"it &apos;s the one that says that doesn &apos;t what you &apos;ve done , it &apos;s bad , it &apos;s you &apos;re bad ."
and that was what i felt .
"and it wasn &apos;t the reason for my <unk> , it was very <unk> ."
"he spoke to the family , and i &apos;m sure he <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , i would not have <unk> ."
but i <unk> these questions .
why did i not ask the <unk> ? why do i <unk> you home ?
"and then in my worst <unk> , how could i make such a <unk> mistake ?"
why did i go to medicine ?
"but slowly , it <unk> ."
i started feeling better .
"and then a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke , and i could tell me i could feel better again ."
"and i <unk> with myself , if i <unk> my efforts to <unk> and never <unk> a mistake that the voice could be <unk> ."
and she did .
and i kept working .
and then it happened again .
"two years later , i had service in the <unk> hospital in a hospital <unk> <unk> , and i was <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
it was a lot of go and i was in <unk> .
he always showed up there .
"i looked at the <unk> , and it was a little pink ."
"and i gave him a <unk> for <unk> , and i sent him out ."
"and even as he went out of the door , he showed him on his <unk> ."
"two days later , i came to my next <unk> , and my <unk> asked me to talk to a conversation in her office ."
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the <unk> ? &quot;
it turned out it &apos;s a <unk> .
he had a <unk> <unk> <unk> disease .
"you can do that , but it &apos;s not an infection of <unk> , but the upper <unk> and causes the <unk> of <unk> ."
"and fortunately , he died ."
he got <unk> <unk> and <unk> a few days later .
"and i went through the same <unk> <unk> and <unk> , felt <unk> and <unk> at work and <unk> to work again and again and again ."
"in a <unk> , i have two <unk> ."
"there &apos;s a lot of things that have heard about that , especially when you &apos;re going to work in a hospital that was just 14 patients per night at that time ."
"in both cases , i won &apos;t send them home , and there was no <unk> in their treatment too ."
"in one , i thought he had <unk> ."
"i <unk> the <unk> of the kidneys of my kidneys . when it was <unk> , my colleague , <unk> , <unk> a <unk> at the bottom on the lower right , and i <unk> the <unk> ."
the other had strong <unk> .
i <unk> to <unk> him and asked to <unk> my colleagues as well .
"and that &apos;s what he did , and he <unk> a <unk> on the right side , he called the <unk> ."
"in both cases , <unk> was <unk> , and they went well ."
"both of them were <unk> to me , and we and <unk> ."
"and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake is just in the first five years of <unk> , which many of my colleagues claim , but <unk> <unk> ."
some of my <unk> <unk> in the last five years .
<unk> and <unk> and support .
"here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t leave my mistakes and i can talk about it , if i &apos;m just going to be a quiet voice that really doesn &apos;t tell me what was happening to my colleagues ?"
how can i teach them my mistakes so that they don &apos;t make the same .
"if i was in a room , like right now , i didn &apos;t know what you think about me ."
when did you hear the last time that you heard about <unk> about <unk> ?
"oh yes , they go to a <unk> party and you like to hear about any other doctor , but you don &apos;t hear somebody talking about your own mistakes ."
"if i was in a room full of colleagues and i would ask their immediate support and <unk> to tell you what i just told you , i would probably not be a very likely to do the end of the second story before you would make a joke a little bit a joke ."
"and even if i knew my colleagues that a <unk> in my hospital had had <unk> a <unk> leg , i believe i could look at problems in the eyes ."
this is the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely <unk> of mistakes .
"it &apos;s a system where it &apos;s two basic <unk> -- those who make mistakes and those that don &apos;t make them , those who are the <unk> , and the <unk> with the bad <unk> and the good <unk> with the good <unk> ."
it &apos;s almost a <unk> reaction like <unk> that <unk> a human .
"and there &apos;s the idea that if we make the ones that make mistakes from medicine to <unk> , that we have an secure system ."
but there are two problems in this .
"in my about 20 years of medical research and journalism , i created a personal medical study on medical <unk> and wrong with all of my first paper for a first article i wrote to the <unk> star , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; as a black <unk> . &quot;"
and what i learned is that <unk> is absolutely <unk> .
"we &apos;re working in a system where every day , in which one of 10 <unk> is either wrong or wrong or <unk> , in the <unk> and always <unk> and <unk> or <unk> or <unk> ."
"in this state , <unk> <unk> died about <unk> <unk> ."
"in the united states , the <unk> <unk> for medicine is the number of 100,000 ."
both are strong <unk> because we don &apos;t think about the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
"in a <unk> in which medical care , all of the two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up with ."
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t <unk> it .
"we have a cognitive mistake , so that we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with a <unk> ."
"then i take the same patient with <unk> , i &apos;ll make it <unk> and <unk> and <unk> still make a <unk> , and suddenly the story is <unk> with <unk> ."
i don &apos;t take the same trend .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all these are errors in <unk> .
"so if you take the system as i was taught , and all of the <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s no one left ."
and you know the <unk> of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
"in my show , &quot; <unk> <unk> , black , &quot; i have the <unk> to say , &quot; this is my <unk> mistake , &quot; i would say to every <unk> from <unk> to the <unk> , &quot; this is my <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; i call my <unk> , &quot; <unk> ."
"and then they <unk> their <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> before their head , then they look down and they try and keep <unk> , and they start to tell their stories ."
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
"they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i <unk> . &quot;"
what you need is a environment that you can <unk> in .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
"the <unk> is <unk> a person , knows how to make his humanity , is not <unk> to make a mistake , but it <unk> everything from them to learn so it can be passed ."
they &apos;re <unk> their experience with other people .
they support their mistakes when they &apos;re <unk> .
"and she shows the other mistakes that they &apos;re not to <unk> , not in a <unk> , but in a <unk> , <unk> way that everybody can benefit from ."
"and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that <unk> that people fill the system with life and if that &apos;s so much , people are also doing mistakes of time ."
"so the system that the system <unk> into creating <unk> that make it easier to make mistakes and allow people to do so deeply <unk> , <unk> spaces , where each of those health , in fact , to actually <unk> the potential , to actually address things , and that means that things that the health care of"
my name is brian <unk> .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
"but i &apos;m a <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn <unk> from it to learn to <unk> others ."
"i don &apos;t think what they &apos;re going to do , but i can live ."
"let me close with three words , i remember ."
"i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea ."
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
"and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you about three stories of time to use time ."
"the first story is by charles darwin , one of my heroes ."
you know that he was <unk> here .
"you might think that he <unk> <unk> , but that &apos;s not true ."
he actually took fish .
he described one of them as a very common .
it was a <unk> .
"until the &apos; 80s in the &apos; 80s , it was <unk> in great style ."
"now , it &apos;s now <unk> in the red list ."
"this story , we &apos;ve heard many times of the galapagos or other places , it &apos;s not very special ."
yet we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally originally .
the <unk> they still describe as <unk> .
what &apos;s happening here ?
"the second story is to do another concept that <unk> <unk> , to <unk> ."
because i <unk> it when i studied a <unk> in <unk> .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could be able to <unk> .
"and i got a <unk> <unk> , and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t get from there ."
it was my first <unk> .
"as you can see , the <unk> of <unk> and a few <unk> were <unk> ."
"there were about 20 <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> ."
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> and the fishermen were living well and <unk> in ghana <unk> .
"when i was 27 years later , the fish had been <unk> on half of its size ."
they <unk> five <unk> .
they were genetically <unk> .
they were still fish .
people were still happy .
"and the fish had the happiness , still be there ."
"so it &apos;s not changed , and yet everything has changed ."
my third little story tells me about my <unk> in <unk> of <unk> .
"in the &apos; 70s -- rather , at the <unk> -- <unk> <unk> a lot of <unk> ."
"<unk> is meant that countries that started <unk> <unk> <unk> , the industrial <unk> ship was called <unk> ."
"i went to it , and we did <unk> in the south africa , and especially in the <unk> sea ."
we had no words for what we started .
i know that it was the reason for the <unk> .
"90 percent of our <unk> were <unk> , others , the <unk> that are connected to the reason ."
"the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the <unk> , the <unk> , were <unk> ."
basically the reason the <unk> came up with <unk> and then <unk> .
"these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition is very fast ."
"within a year , you <unk> a <unk> and then you start with the <unk> <unk> ."
the reason is changing . in this case -- a <unk> reason or <unk> corals will be <unk> <unk> .
this is a dead <unk> .
"they were not <unk> ; they were <unk> , because they were dead ."
once we started a <unk> .
she wasn &apos;t even <unk> .
"then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat them well ."
"in fact , this mountain of <unk> will <unk> every time of fishermen , when they &apos;re going to go into areas where they never had <unk> ."
but it &apos;s not going to be documented .
"we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it ."
"we &apos;re <unk> our new <unk> of the new level , and we don &apos;t <unk> ourselves , which was there ."
"if you &apos;re <unk> , this is what happens ."
"on the <unk> , a couple of things : <unk> , number of <unk> , the green <unk> that the green one is <unk> ."
"and the time it &apos;s changed . it &apos;s changing because it changes for people , of course , their actions ."
"every generation looks at the <unk> that <unk> them at the beginning of their <unk> life , as the standard and everything is <unk> ."
the difference then is <unk> .
but they don &apos;t take the <unk> losses .
there &apos;s a order of changes of change .
"and at the end , they just want to get the <unk> remains ."
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing now .
"we want to get things that are gone , or things that are not as much as they were ."
"you could think that the problem is that people who were sure when they lived in <unk> societies , animals and killed after a few generations of what they did ."
"because obviously , an animal that &apos;s been often often often <unk> before it <unk> ."
so you don &apos;t lose animals very often .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and so it &apos;s not that much of loss .
"we &apos;re going to focus on the large animals and in the ocean , these are the big fish ."
they &apos;re <unk> because we &apos;re going to start .
"and there &apos;s a little fish that remains there , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> ."
"the question is , why people accept it ."
"well , because they don &apos;t know it was different ."
"of course , many people , scientists , scientists , tell that it was really different ."
"you &apos;ll tell it because the evidence you &apos;re <unk> in a former form , not as you would like to <unk> the evidence ."
"there &apos;s an <unk> , for example , that the <unk> report of a <unk> <unk> that can &apos;t be used in this area , can &apos;t be used , or not <unk> by <unk> , because he &apos;s not <unk> ."
"so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in <unk> societies , because they don &apos;t trust the past ."
this shows the huge amount of big role that a <unk> can play .
"because <unk> <unk> , we basically <unk> the past ."
"we &apos;re able to imagine the past that people can &apos;t realize , because the <unk> has changed and very low ."
so people can see the people who see a <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> that allows for their <unk> to their <unk> .
"what about the people that this is not possible because they don &apos;t have access to access -- the people in the middle of the west , for example ?"
"here , i think , the art and the film might fill the gap , and <unk> ."
this is the simulation of the <unk> bay bay .
there was a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
"and the <unk> and <unk> , you might remember &quot; avatar . &quot;"
"when you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about it , why people were so touched by this -- except by the <unk> , why were they so touched by the <unk> ?"
because it &apos;s something <unk> that &apos;s lost in some ways .
"so my <unk> , the only thing i &apos;ll give is cameron <unk> so he <unk> &quot; avatar . &quot;"
thank you .
"in the &apos; 80s , in the <unk> , in <unk> , you had to have a <unk> <unk> , that was <unk> by government ."
they also had to have a sheet of <unk> from these <unk> <unk> .
the reason for this : the government could <unk> where a text was <unk> .
"they found a paper with <unk> <unk> , they could <unk> the <unk> of this thought ."
"and we couldn &apos;t understand in the west , as anyone could do , and how much of the freedom of freedom would be ."
we would never do something like that in our own countries .
"but if you &apos;re in 2011 , a new <unk> of leading <unk> and a page <unk> , then the light yellow <unk> <unk> on every side , in a pattern , the side of you clearly <unk> your <unk> ."
this is what we &apos;re going on today .
and that &apos;s no one &apos;s <unk> .
"and this was an example of what our own governments are using technology to us , to use citizens ."
and this is one of the three major sources that &apos;s been available today .
let &apos;s look at what really happens in the world : we can <unk> the attacks in categories .
we have three <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> .
"for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> in the <unk> ."
and the <unk> of <unk> are very easily understood .
these people deserve money .
"they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money ."
"there are several cases of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that made their money through attacks ."
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in <unk> .
this is alfred <unk> <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
"this is <unk> anderson , <unk> <unk> , and so on and so on ."
"these people have come online and they &apos;ve <unk> it by <unk> <unk> to <unk> money from our bank to <unk> , while we were doing our <unk> , or even <unk> our <unk> , the computer <unk> , on the <unk> that we &apos;ve collected on the keyboard ."
"the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two months ago , the swiss <unk> from mr. <unk> &apos;s <unk> here , and on this <unk> <unk> was <unk> million dollars when it was <unk> ."
"mr. <unk> itself is <unk> feet , and it &apos;s <unk> unknown ."
"and i want to suggest that today &apos;s <unk> that we &apos;re going to be victims of a <unk> , as a <unk> crime in the real world ."
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to be worse .
"in the future , most organized crime will be <unk> online ."
the <unk> <unk> that we can see today are not motivated by money .
"they &apos;re <unk> by something else -- <unk> , an opinion , or through their audience ."
"groups like <unk> are over the last 12 months , and they &apos;re on one of the <unk> in the field of <unk> ."
"so these are the three <unk> : <unk> that do it for money , <unk> like <unk> , that are <unk> by <unk> , but the last group are nations , governments that are spending the attacks ."
we &apos;re <unk> of cases like the <unk> .
it shows <unk> what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> of the <unk> -- or it was .
"the last fall , it had to be <unk> <unk> , because <unk> was been <unk> ."
"somebody was <unk> , and had <unk> the system ."
"and last week , in a meeting week , i asked one of the <unk> of these group who asked whether he could <unk> it for possible that , because of the <unk> people had died ."
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
"now , how do people die in the same kind of like this <unk> ?"
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
"now , a <unk> is a <unk> , if you have a <unk> with a <unk> service , you have a <unk> service , for example ."
"now we use all , or many of us , <unk> or a <unk> , but these services are particularly distributed in the most <unk> states of iran , where foreign foreign foreign foreign <unk> can use them , as local government , and they can be <unk> more than the better to trust them as local confidence they"
"you can but , if you &apos;re in a foreign ."
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s what happens in the <unk> of <unk> .
what does it like the arab spring and the things that happen in egypt for example ?
"well , in egypt , the <unk> <unk> in 2011 , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they found a lot of <unk> ."
"in this <unk> , a <unk> was called &quot; <unk> . &quot;"
"and in this <unk> <unk> , <unk> in germany had sold a <unk> company that had sold some programs , with which they were -- in very large , <unk> communication communication system ."
they had sold this program for <unk> government to the <unk> government .
the <unk> is right here .
so <unk> governments are <unk> governments to go to and <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
but western governments help themselves .
"for example , in germany , only a few weeks ago , a <unk> of the so-called <unk> , which was a <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> to <unk> their own citizens ."
"if you &apos;re in a <unk> <unk> , you &apos;re pretty much <unk> your phone ."
but today we are far beyond that .
they <unk> their <unk> .
"they use tools like the <unk> to <unk> their computer with a <unk> that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , their <unk> <unk> ."
"so if we &apos;re going to keep thinking about these things , the obvious answer to people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but i don &apos;t know , because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen ."
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to <unk> . &quot;
and these <unk> don &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be there .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
"and as we today , in 2011 , our governments like trust , but every right now we &apos;re going to be <unk> for forever ."
"and trust , we trust , <unk> blind to any future government , government that we may have in <unk> years ?"
these are the questions that we need to be in the next 50 years .
"it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big <unk> of <unk> ."
the first <unk> were made by <unk> and <unk> <unk> of a simple idea : <unk> out of <unk> with <unk> that fit .
<unk> were very quickly <unk> by the world &apos;s <unk> .
"they were able to build things that were bigger than us , building , <unk> , a rock after the other ."
"essentially , the <unk> was the <unk> of our time ."
"almost a hundred years later , in <unk> , lego <unk> came out ."
it &apos;s called the &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
"and within less years , lego moved in every household ."
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks have been produced -- or 75 stones for each person on this planet .
"they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful <unk> buildings ."
lego lego made it for all possible .
"lego lego basically has the <unk> , the <unk> of the world , and made it out for our imagination ."
"in the same year at the same year , the bell <unk> <unk> the next revolution , the next <unk> ."
the <unk> was a little <unk> that would take us from a world of <unk> building blocks to a world where everything was <unk> .
"as the <unk> , the <unk> allows us to build much more complex , more complex strategy , a stone , after the other ."
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the <unk> was just experts .
"i personally believe that the <unk> that the <unk> of our time is <unk> to experts , and so i decided to change that ."
"eight years ago , i was at the media lab and i started to explore this idea how to make the power of engineers could put in hand and <unk> ."
"a few years ago , i started developing <unk> ."
so let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic <unk> that have a specific function .
"they &apos;re <unk> , light , <unk> , engine and sensor ."
and the best thing is that they connect together with magnets .
so they can &apos;t <unk> them out <unk> .
the rocks are <unk> .
"green is a copy , blue is electricity , pink and orange is wires ."
"all you have to do is have to connect a blue and a green one , and you can build a very quickly <unk> ."
"you add a blue blue , and you can do light ."
you can switch a switch in between them and put it into a little <unk> .
"take the switch out to a <unk> that &apos;s here , <unk> , and they made a little <unk> ."
"and they add these <unk> to an extra effect , and they made a <unk> effect ."
i &apos;ll stop that .
"and beyond the simple games , it &apos;s actually <unk> ."
"instead of <unk> that you have to code , or <unk> , you allow <unk> to <unk> with simple gestures ."
"so to slow down the <unk> , or slow , just turn it on the button and make it slow down faster or slow down ."
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring each individual interaction into the world in a <unk> rock .
"lights , <unk> , <unk> , motors , motors -- everything should be available ."
we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> kids and they &apos;re seeing playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful is how you start to understand the electronics that you &apos;re in your daily life and learning that you &apos;re not in school .
"like a <unk> works , or why the doors of <unk> , or how to <unk> a <unk> ."
we &apos;ve also brought <unk> <unk> .
"so we had designers , for example , with no experience in electronic things that started playing with <unk> as material ."
"here we see , with <unk> , paper and <unk> , like <unk> ..."
"so a few weeks ago we brought <unk> <unk> and gave them some <unk> that had no <unk> experience -- wood and paper and paper -- and paper -- and they said , &quot; what does . &quot;"
"here &apos;s an example of a <unk> that they did , a <unk> <unk> ."
"but wait , this is really my <unk> ."
"it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , <unk> in the darkness ."
"for those <unk> , <unk> was another material , electronics became just another material ."
and we want to make this material available for all of the things .
so <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
"you can go to the <unk> , all the <unk> and make them make them ."
"we want to <unk> the world of <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the world , the world we live in , the <unk> world , is <unk> us ."
"so , they go and they start to invent ."
thank you .
