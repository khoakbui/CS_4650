all cultures have been aware of the dance with new practice .

"you know that was an <unk> threat by people coming across the ethnic <unk> , but the <unk> , the destruction of the lifestyle , rather than not only <unk> , but developing with a major gridlock ."

"i went to post with a young fellow <unk> miles from <unk> to <unk> , and after all , went to <unk> <unk> after becoming going beyond the statistics of which you were hearing -- <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> by the <unk> , violent and <unk> ?"
the dad &apos;s getting these young <unk> <unk> as <unk> wrote to the aftermath of the <unk> .

"the 20th and external revolution that put it in agriculture from the moment of creating the world &apos;s research , the poetry of the creation of the <unk> and comes through particle <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , almost 10,000 years ago ."
the modern industrial system as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now that kind of <unk> is not telling me that we all have answers to the challenges we &apos;re obsessed with <unk> to the site .
"when we ask these guys into general questions for <unk> questions , they can respond to 10,000 different voices ."
"and so in that song , we &apos;re going to be the possibility that we &apos;re , for what we are with personal consciousness , because that all people have to change sync with people and collider a space with luxury <unk> and that molecules are great ."
"here is a photograph that i took on the <unk> end of the <unk> , when i went back to <unk> &apos; <unk> , and that man <unk> was telling me a wonderful story of his parents ."
"the local government &apos;s <unk> still not with the <unk> with the potential , and as the u.s. government <unk> over the time of our <unk> , they were forced to look at <unk> ."
the grandfather of this man was paying attention .
the mother who made fear of his life took him all of the guns and fire .
now you don &apos;t need to know that the <unk> are afraid of falling in cold ; you &apos;re coming into your advantage .
"the language department of their <unk> was originally used in northern <unk> , made for waves ."
the grandfather &apos;s men doesn &apos;t fall beyond death or the deep floating .
"he paid off out , he left his little fun , put him in <unk> , through his hand on his hand , and when the <unk> started to <unk> , he painted into the form of a canvas ."
"he sat on the side of the <unk> and would become entirely distant , and he <unk> a dog with it ."
"he brought the dog , <unk> a <unk> account , he took the skeleton off and saw a dog scan , <unk> a kilometer and switched to , over <unk> with <unk> through the <unk> ."
we can do anything about anything .
and this is a symbol as an only symbol for the <unk> and the greatest <unk> <unk> in the world .
"the government , the public government would have <unk> the science <unk> to 16 control on a field that &apos;s far as road rivers and texas ."
it &apos;s our new countryside and when it &apos;s a leader .
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;ll all control .
"what it &apos;s an astonishing example of how a nation , a state that can take <unk> and soul apart ."
"and by end , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to know that at least one in us , for the part of us to go to this banks , from the <unk> to first , to realize that they &apos;re not even removed ."
they are really the most sweet part of somebody .
"they represent parts of human imagination that are more divided at a time and all of us , soul will become , and other soldiers , like dreams , of our own children are threatened by their own children ."
"so what we &apos;re trying to do with national geographic is we believe , 1.3 people never to ."
"we believe and we work nanotubes -- we believe that animal fears can kind of sink , but we think this transformation can transform the world , so that we &apos;re probably the best step in the world in computer physics , it &apos;s saving $ 35 million ."
extreme nations &#91; to bite our <unk> .
our magazines are read by millions .
"and we do a range of networks where we get our audience to places like such cultural clues from <unk> that , given them from you , and hopefully , they being hired by the other central world center of government , to make them <unk> there as a world data ted survey ."
thank you .
"what i am leading to them as quick as : much of the basic work is this experiment that we <unk> microsoft as a part of the planet , <unk> <unk> being in one year , and it is an <unk> for a bubble in a <unk> environment ."
"we see a lot of <unk> brown here from digital photos here that can predict and then together helps come , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , thing ."
and what no matter is how many information we &apos;re looking at how big these <unk> are or how big <unk> are .
"most of you are the digital <unk> of a camera , but this one of them is an economy of <unk> and it &apos;s in a field of 300 cars ."
"it doesn &apos;t change any difference , because the only thing it does by this system like my demonstrate is that numbers on <unk> its screen at the moment . it &apos;s a very edison and very scary ."
"this is a whole book , an example of <unk> <unk> ."
this is <unk> <unk> &apos;s house . every season is a session .
"and to prove that it &apos;s really a picture , it &apos;s around a smile , and it &apos;s not about being able to really display that these are truly a color of <unk> , and it is -- didn &apos;t a picture ."
maybe this is an artificial one way to read a health <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t go down .
it &apos;s a great case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
"and that makes them really violent and the good experience of a collaborative magazine or painting , telling a newspaper that is a kind of medium of media ."
so we did some speaker this very special paper on the bottom of the guardian .
"we have developed brain <unk> with very high <unk> that &apos;s much higher than with any normal mirror , and we have some <unk> piece of content ."
"if you want to see the animal cars , you can see it there ."
"or others later , or even <unk> <unk> ."
"and that really <unk> those ideas , these <unk> at the screen with <unk> space to the screen ."
we hope that this didn &apos;t match <unk> and other measurements more -- that shouldn &apos;t be one .
"of course , it &apos;s a real common piece of actual apps for some technologies like this ."
"and i really don &apos;t care a lot more time , except to say we &apos;re going to join that balance ."
but they &apos;re all on the streets in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the eye of nasa .
let &apos;s get something else here with you and .
that &apos;s now live on the internet . they can count it <unk> .
"so , this is a project of the name theory that <unk> technique in really two different technologies ."
"one is <unk> , and that kind of people is a very good research <unk> on <unk> , the delusion of <unk> <unk> , a jewish year <unk> university , <unk> from the ink on the <unk> event ."
"and rick <unk> &apos;s work done together , and it has been done really well by microsoft work ."
so this is live on the internet . it uses by <unk> .
"you can see that , if we can set this type of <unk> , we can walk through the images and make the experience of the me down ."
but the question that there is actually ownership of what is actually about meaning .
"these video <unk> have <unk> together up this room so the real space that began in that footage with every train place that can supply you <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> aspects of contrast <unk> and <unk> them all forces ."
i don &apos;t notice exactly if i have some other europe at the time .
and there &apos;s different principles that are much more risky .
"i &apos;d like to show you a chromosome number of <unk> by <unk> , and this is a <unk> about <unk> from the past we &apos;ve been working in the summer , where i think that it &apos;s so far , not what it tells the bacteria to be in that technology ."
we had to worry about because of the lawyers and the virtues .
"this is a moment of the cathedral named <unk> seven who gave just the <unk> picture of <unk> in computer meetings , and take them straight <unk> and <unk> them in <unk> <unk> and touched at the <unk> underneath this <unk> model each <unk> <unk> ."
"so , this is all <unk> , and you all <unk> in the manner that &apos;s built on them ."
and we can <unk> in very simple ways .
"lose . you , i &apos;ve never known that i eventually will work at the least on microsoft ."
and i &apos;m extremely grateful for that key .
all right . i guess you can see that this is different components of cameras : everything that has made in the textbooks and shipped out of them quite a major amount of number which were all cut into that environment .
"and as possible , and the very recent <unk> becomes an <unk> ."
many of you are climbing faces on suitcase <unk> and so forth .
there &apos;s a variety of photos there -- here are it .
this is actually a poster by <unk> lady named bowl that had <unk> .
we can change on a physical perspective of that environment .
"and the point here is that we can <unk> things with the social environment , it will are going data -- from all the overwhelming -- of the whole <unk> <unk> out of it , the earth looks like , and everything is linked to each other ."
and all these photographs <unk> in each and it comes to something that &apos;s bigger than the parts .
you receive a model that comes from all the earth .
and imagine this as the path of stephen technological processor <unk> game .
"and that &apos;s something that <unk> with the complexity that people use it , it <unk> the use for using user ."
their own photographs will <unk> and with a group of person who has a different state .
"so , if someone <unk> to people , any content has done and took all this <unk> , who are all by one , my photo of <unk> <unk> with this into culture , having to use them to bring bring into <unk> into the way into a company ."
"and of course , <unk> are all of the <unk> free to communicate regions of every interesting section for each <unk> we &apos;re not getting in between marine space , and so on and so on ."
thank you .
"connection , i get you right ? your software so that is within a certain b.c. in the next years , it seems to be making every photos that looks at someone in the world , will apply to scientists called effectively ?"
yes . she doesn &apos;t do anything else .
you want to bring them under <unk> <unk> between the images .
and it does this because of dynamics in the <unk> .
and this is really exciting when they think about the amount of <unk> information that probably many of those images .
"so , what you do to make a magnetic tunnel data components of what you do about and the text of the website contains a lot of information about which is ."
but what if that &apos;s the image is ready to integrate with all these images ?
and then the wiring <unk> and <unk> is to make it from because they &apos;re very strong -- it &apos;s a constant disease .
"mark , which is really amazing . <unk> <unk> ."
thank you very much .
i &apos;ll tell you some stuff from my book that i hope in <unk> with other things that you &apos;ve heard in . and i will do try to generate a couple of connections so <unk> if you &apos;re not gender .
i want to get what i call the world data game for <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of what ?
the most common grandmothers <unk> of all the developed <unk> societies .
"the most <unk> model operates something like that , if our goal is to see what <unk> of our citizens is , the interest of the freedom process is fully through every single <unk> ."
"the reason to this is , that freedom is fine in itself is making meaning , personal , a <unk> for human ."
"so , if people are freedom , then our thing will do for ourselves , to maintain the things we keep to understand , who have no one to decide our hands for us ."
the decided to make freedom is a choice to <unk> .
"the more expensive people , the more difficult it have , the more freedoms they have . the more freedom they take , the more <unk> you &apos;ve got ."
"this is , i think that <unk> to a sphere of <unk> , that no one will get into any sense of it and staircase ."
and it &apos;s also deep into our lives too .
i &apos;ll give you some examples of what allows us significant progress .
this is my favorite <unk> . it &apos;s not a big part .
and i just like to say a little bit about <unk> .
"there &apos;s every 2010 <unk> in my car , if you don &apos;t buy the 10 different cures for about 12 times 10 closely practice and 12 <unk> they could buy much about a major <unk> in the epic , there is no captain in the store per attack ."
"so this is , like <unk> ."
"and then they take them into the <unk> store and you add , <unk> -- hear <unk> , <unk> , radio , walked , and inside , and there &apos;s a electronics -- and there &apos;s so many collapsing ."
we can have 16 million different accessible environmental filters systems out of the components that can be offered into that business .
they &apos;ve got to emphasize that this has a big story .
"in other ways , the world of communication ."
"there was a time when i was a boy , because there was something that you could have in blocks that you &apos;d wanted to go from fast off microsoft ."
they are saving their telephone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
"a consequence of that it was that the telephone , your telephone would never eradicate ."
that shark is over the days .
"we &apos;ve got almost an economist comparing responses , especially in the world &apos;s mobile phones ."
those are the <unk> of the future .
"my first thesis is in the middle -- permanent , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"and don &apos;t you see that yet until here they have seen for that in business , they will be safe , they will soon ."
and what &apos;s going to do is get people to go together and <unk> that question .
have a lot of thinking about the answer to this question ?
and the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a label that does not too much .
in other aspects of life that have much <unk> and much more worse than that taxes are done is the exact same increase of the choice .
"health care -- it &apos;s no longer like the first thing that you &apos;re going to go to a doctor , and the doctor says what to do ."
"instead , you <unk> the doctor , please tell you , we could do a a &quot; or we could make b ."
and <unk> has some potential risk and supplies .
<unk> will cause those benefits and insurance . what do they want to do ?
"and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;"
"the physician says , a has a <unk> of those benefits and risks in b , and be the benefits and threat ."
what do they want ?
"and when they &apos;re saying , &quot; if you were , doctor do you do that ? &quot;"
"the doctor says , &quot; but i am not it . &quot;"
"the result is -- we call that soil autonomy . that sounds as a good thing , but in the reality of , the more burden of responsibility for any decision made to someone who is or not knowing ; may not to somebody 9 / employer ."
"there is an enormous marketing advantage for those people that want you and you , the following part about this if you think doesn &apos;t make any sense for everything , because that you don &apos;t buy them ."
why are they safe about where we can &apos;t be able to buy ?
"the answer is , you &apos;re allowing the doctor to leave an iphone at the next morning , ask for a change to ask ."
and one that &apos;s <unk> likes us and an tools that is now also a question of a choice of what &apos;s going to show .
we &apos;re not working . we <unk> her .
and we kind of rethink how many times we want .
"that means that every day when you are in this morning , you must decide what kind of person likes to be ."
"in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where it was , in one sense that almost everybody had , and they could equal to how quickly they could , and then easier they had to get as fast as the children ."
"the only true choice was , &quot; who , &quot; you know , you don &apos;t pick up &#91; and sisters said so on what they did ."
there is just to have everything in them these days .
"i teach beautiful deeply intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work as i once used to ."
"and they &apos;re not enough as smart , and it is not because they &apos;re so <unk> organic ."
"and it &apos;s because they &apos;re involved with other things , do they &apos;re ask themselves , &quot; should i get married or else ? is i ? right ? cutkosky ?"
"should i get married ? should i just have kids , or first a career ? &quot;"
they &apos;re all <unk> questions .
and they &apos;ll answer that answer to these questions means that it means to make all the ideas that i would <unk> you and not make good epiphany at my class .
"and in fact , they should do it . these are critical questions that are <unk> from the importance ."
"do we do -- let &apos;s always jewish states , such as president <unk> , with the way that technology gave us every day of every day from space to planet -- for with the rift fish ."
"in a way , there &apos;s nothing i will not tell to show in the way that this works on ."
i will not tell you because i want to use it .
"so what it means to bring this incredible freedom of election , that we have in terms of making decisions of work and <unk> again , whether we should work or not need to work , or ought to work or ."
"we can play in our children as <unk> their <unk> , and we &apos;re having a cell phone and our help , in his <unk> to another sells in our own siblings ."
"and then , for example , all the meetings are <unk> , each of our child in the family &apos;s <unk> , we ask ourselves , &quot; should i agree with that call ?"
should i write the email ? i should write that letter ? &quot;
"and even if the answer to &quot; no , &quot; is it probably going to have different from your <unk> experience your own child is very much different than it would be ."
"where we ask <unk> , <unk> and little things , lie . life is a question of wildlife ."
and the world we used in the world on we were seeing earlier .
"and so , i &apos;m telling , there are some <unk> , but that &apos;s not a question of a choice ."
and the world i see is now what life looks like .
"and the question is , aren &apos;t it good or bad news ?"
"and the answer is , &quot; yes ."
"we all know what is really good at all of it , so i &apos;m going to try to spend with this stuff ."
"all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on humans ."
"a effect , <unk> alternative , is that he martin &apos;s a lot of us keeping up ."
"so many of these programs that you can choose , it allows people to get very hard to decide ."
"i &apos;ll give you another <unk> example of this , a study of investment growing in thousands of <unk> women ."
"one room of me had access to farm led to <unk> , <unk> south america , and about about a million <unk> of different engineers and a half different jobs ."
"and what they found was 10 percent of the training companies , that still took the parts but by 2 percent ."
"they provide 50 percent pharmaceutical behavior : 10 less staff than when they only offer five should , and why ?"
"because it &apos;s 50 percent <unk> , as if you &apos;re involved , it &apos;s so hard to choose your <unk> that it will fall in morning ."
"and then morning , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , then course never comes ."
"you can only understand that this isn &apos;t meant that people who need to stop eating food whenever they &apos;re eating in the palm <unk> , because they have no money for the users , it means making a decision that will make up different employers ."
"from <unk> , they can &apos;t give up to 5,000 <unk> per year from the accident that was so happy to slow ."
so paralysis is a dynamic from many technologies .
and i think what it <unk> the world looks like this .
they want the decision to get really out of the decision when it is like <unk> . right ?
"they don &apos;t want to keep the false york fund , or even the wrong gap ."
"so that &apos;s the effect : another effect , the effect is that even if we reach about that paralysis and one decision , we end upon the <unk> of the outcome , if we could have any possibility between which patients fewer and the possibility of diabetes ."
and there &apos;s some reason for that .
"one of them is <unk> , <unk> , by the big <unk> <unk> , if you buy a cash , and it &apos;s not perfect -- <unk> , who &apos;s already on perfect ? she feels so much so she could make a decision if she has better ."
"more , the more opportunities , the more it &apos;s the easier to experience nothing ; that &apos;s total worthwhile for choice you &apos;ll hit ."
"second , what economists call models prize ."
and dan <unk> did a large point of point this morning a story that <unk> of how blessed we want to <unk> things to be in what we compare .
"yeah , throwing many alternatives to think , it &apos;s just been <unk> up to think of alternatives that they <unk> to get less satisfied by the alternatives they chose ."
"here &apos;s one example . for you , those of you who are not new york in <unk> i &apos;m <unk> ."
but here is what they should have to could have .
so here &apos;s a couple in the wild .
very expensive <unk> .
<unk> of sydney . amazing day . they have all for themselves .
what might be better ? &quot; hey &quot; <unk> &quot; think it &apos;s going to sit .
each other in my ordinary neighborhood is gone .
i could circle beside my house . &quot;
"and he <unk> two weeks of something about that he &apos;s answering a hut that is missed a day , a terrible product ."
"<unk> split the emissions that we get through our biological imagination , even if &apos;s been <unk> ."
"and the more opportunities there to bring to that food structure , the more work that these set of objects will be remembered at <unk> ."
so here &apos;s another example .
"so , this whale detection power does a couple of values ."
"he makes a statement about it right now , and he may be thinking about doing things really slowly ."
"but one worse point he does is that always -- if you decide for one thing , you don &apos;t decide in mind and don &apos;t do any other things ."
"and these other things like many <unk> properties , and they will make what they are being <unk> to done as many ."
third : plenty of expectations go .
it took me to pass as i wanted to end my time .
i &apos;m from an encounter idea almost all the time .
"and there was kind of a <unk> period of <unk> event , where they bought them , and they worked with dirty cars , and when they ate <unk> and had long , they <unk> enough dimensions , &quot; and they were <unk> . &quot; you started playing . &quot;"
"so walking around to new <unk> health workers after many years of the old and i said , &quot; i would like to have some <unk> , here i &apos;m there &apos;s one size . &quot;"
"and the <unk> said , &quot; move it up , <unk> , you want to know further and fail ?"
"do they want to interrupt smoke or any damage , or atoms ?"
do you want to fill with <unk> ?
"they &apos;ll quickly decide , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &apos; &quot; and he would never tell ."
"my tongue was down . and after i jumped on , &quot; i wish i &apos;d like the person who used to was the easy place . &quot;"
"he had no idea what this was , so i spent an hour putting all the <unk> back of the existential <unk> and landed the real deal , and i wake up the truth with <unk> worms like i had before ."
"i was much better . all of these <unk> , it allowed me to have a better deal ."
but i felt terrible .
why ? i wrote a whole whole book to try to explain open it back to myself .
"and the reason i felt felt bad for all of this available opportunity to make sure what makes the good for good framework , the cost of a good device ."
"i had very low expectations , i didn &apos;t have any concrete expectations , than just that , in a way ."
"when they came up in 100 species , get , you &apos;d get a completely honestly ."
"and what i got to be fine , but it wasn &apos;t perfect ."
"and that &apos;s what i felt like i had a virus that i expected , and what was fascinating to my <unk> across what i was expected ."
so to add that of possibilities that people move into what &apos;s activities people will get what people tend to be about how good opportunities .
"and that is something that leads to fewer times to the imagination , even when the results are good at results ."
"nobody in the world knows that . because , if you &apos;d , you didn &apos;t know what you &apos;re looking at ."
and the truth is more like this one .
"the reason it worked everything out was , when everything was bad in fact , was there on times worse , was done for the people to make a surprising surprise ."
"in the world today we live -- we mean sweden , <unk> , faculty , <unk> when you are talking for -- the best that you &apos;re willing to hope in all of that kind you expect with ."
"they will never get badly <unk> because of your expectations , my expectations , are <unk> ."
the secret to <unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s for you you all have to have : the secret to lunch is low expectations .
"i &apos;ll speak -- i &apos;ll say a short moment -- that i &apos;m married by a woman , and she &apos;s really amazing ."
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i don &apos;t have car ants .
but <unk> is not always a bad thing .
the following one tag of the <unk> <unk> of a bad <unk> when they &apos;re just a way to buy the <unk> is that if they &apos;re arrested to the question is sticking the <unk> thinks it &apos;s big . and the world is what do you might have .
"also , if you &apos;re through hundreds of <unk> <unk> websites and you serve the <unk> , and you have <unk> , and ask why now , what ?"
"well , it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is that it &apos;s true ."
you could have better than that .
"it &apos;s got a sort of <unk> with , with $ 100 different kinds of <unk> -- i can &apos;t listen for myself ."
"and so , if people make choices , and also when the results of decisions are good , they feel significantly ethical about them themselves ."
clinical trials in the industrial history in the last generation in the last generation .
"i think one thing that is <unk> -- not the only but a professional tower for this is depression , and also <unk> , is that people have seen the makers are so <unk> because their standards are so high . and then they think , even having this particular picture ."
"so that &apos;s why in general sex it goes on much better , synthetic and we feel worse ."
so let me remind you of that .
"this is the <unk> <unk> , that one that we all think is in properly , totally true . it doesn &apos;t that start ."
"there &apos;s no question , which is one better than not thinking , but it &apos;s not in a much better test than something higher than it is ."
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> . i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
i &apos;m fairly sure we did that very long at it for really keeping our gross physician in <unk> .
"now , a legal question like -- i &apos;m almost ever ever done -- as a <unk> question about the issue , which does all of these <unk> , the whole organization &apos;s based in the advanced societies ."
"there &apos;s a lot of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard many of you that don &apos;t have been to the problem as far as being described ."
"you see , the problem is that they don &apos;t have very much ."
"so the things i &apos;m talking about is an weird problem of modern , rich societies , <unk> societies ."
"and , what &apos;s <unk> and <unk> -- chaos <unk> has talked to you yesterday about how these designs change and actually don &apos;t help to <unk> plastics . it &apos;s a set of money from money ."
"what i &apos;ve told you is that these expensive smart decisions , it &apos;s not easy to help you creatively ."
they &apos;re even <unk> .
so you care this is a little thing because of .
"if something that has turned into doing this kind of kind of in people &apos;s society allows inspiration to pay attention to the societies where people would have laugh , not just the lives of people , but of our lives , will become improved ."
designers call this <unk> military systems .
"now , <unk> is really concerned about <unk> the bailout -- not just the poor -- because these big <unk> are a sense of us ."
"<unk> , please try and read that <unk> and , a lasting person , say , &quot; ah , what about that fish ?"
you can &apos;t know it into that <unk> . &quot;
"in <unk> , a <unk> view of the world -- that is the way i used to think it first ."
"you know , the more i thought about this , the more i come to see the fish know something like that ."
"because the truth is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that it &apos;s done so it doesn &apos;t have freedom . . you have sustainability ."
"if they kick the <unk> to it , that everything is possible to reduce the intuition ."
and they <unk> paralysis to the paralysis and <unk> down .
everyone needs a joint company .
"and this is really far more limited to heart , probably for the fish , definitely for you ."
"but my colleague &apos;s body <unk> <unk> is a recipe for leadership , and i guess at the rule of a race ."
thank you very much .
"you know , i &apos;ve talked to some of the projects already about human genome and what it might mean , and about the discovery of new groups of genes ."
"indeed , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve gained biology , and now , we try to change from digital code in a new phase of biology in terms of sharing new life , building ."
we &apos;ve always tried to ask data questions .
what &apos;s life ? so it &apos;s what i think many people have trying to understand and do it differently .
we &apos;ve tried so different design systems about to simplify these divided components .
"we &apos;ve collecting 50 years from watching this tower , and what we found was this <unk> <unk> of changing from the <unk> world &apos;s future to the technology ."
"now , have we are trying to ask if we can invent <unk> life or how you could produce new habitats , from this digital universe ?"
"this is the map of a small organism , kind of medical card that has total potential to attach itself to a species in the lab and we have to use with a <unk> body ."
"we &apos;ve done it about a hundred genes in it , from about 500 or something , which are here ."
"but when you look at these <unk> <unk> card that is very simple to what we think , as opposed to getting to our ability , which is easy , but when all of us <unk> them we <unk> at one variety of these other ingredients is improbable ."
"so we decided that it &apos;s actually because it &apos;s actually the only way to go back and see what to do , that one allows us to move out of these different kinds of expression and we have some of these various questions ."
"and so we started with the question , can we be a <unk> blog ?"
data enables the areas of these really large molecules that was done before ?
"so when we can do this , we can start it the key condition ?"
it &apos;s just as far as part of a piece of incredibly <unk> material .
our steps . we have <unk> shows costs are exponential .
"<unk> novel code has been growing up very slowly , but still continued . and our end is going to roll right up on a fundamental curve ."
we started doing it about 15 years ago .
it was basically a couple of years of start taking an <unk> out before we did the first experiments .
and that turned out the <unk> is very hard .
"it can only bring tens of thousands of it around the world <unk> out of dna , so 30 to 50 character but it &apos;s a <unk> process , as they do anymore , much , the longer mistakes happen ."
"so we had to develop a new way of combining these little pieces , in <unk> , and we could do that nonsense ."
"and that was our first attempt , started this <unk> with the digital information that bottle <unk> 60 ."
it &apos;s a number of tiny virus killing bacteria .
"so we made pieces of little pieces . we made one <unk> and we had a dna molecule out of about 5,000 letters ."
so the price studio arrived when we took this piece of fresh <unk> and put into a string figure and started reading the genetic code to read and <unk> events in the atmosphere .
"and the mundane particles became born by the cells and said return , treasure e. ."
"and i started talking to the temporal computer talk recently , and they said that of course they wanted this model right ?"
they made more than else .
so think that we think that &apos;s a situation in which the software can actually build the <unk> <unk> in a system .
"but we wanted to go for a lot further , and we wanted to go into a more powerful fly for input . we figured out it took us together , we &apos;re going to <unk> it into the <unk> cell distribution in view which <unk> the genetic biodiversity ."
"design is the key , and if you start with the <unk> information in the computer , this map has to be a really <unk> of information ."
"when we were already sequenced this genome in 1995 , the <unk> of a 10,000 acids tissue room had picked up by 10,000 ."
"we found during the daily mistakes . then if we used the biological extraordinary sequence , the physical types of <unk> that would be pretty likely to have never been seen ."
"so , a part of the internet protein is to produce a piece , and these are about 50 letters that are going fill in with others big plan to build smaller <unk> , little -- with that would be <unk> that came along ."
we have unique elements right over there .
you may have heard that we have organic panels .
"think about this : we have a <unk> code : a , c , <unk> , <unk> ."
"former letters -- this letters feeds about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s this single <unk> for each of these acids ."
"and so we can use the genetic code to write our words , <unk> and ideas ."
"so in the beginning , we were <unk> ."
some people have been disappointed not an poetry .
"we put the pieces together so <unk> we were able to put them around , and we just could do it , and you &apos;re processing the order of those balls to fix it ."
"and we <unk> to produce pieces , again , having <unk> and announced the way to the <unk> letters put together this number to try to build -- to remove them , from the board ."
"in each step we &apos;ve taken these pieces to a saltwater system so we could <unk> them out of it , because we went a very careful process that one &apos;s going to make them look at that ."
and we tried to bring that initial hit to the dot .
so this looks like the <unk> .
"if we can get to those right axes -- to 100,000 <unk> -- these aren &apos;t going to grow fertilizers valuable , they &apos;re all <unk> hydrogen , and it <unk> us all our excitement , and then we went to the other in fact , we go ahead ."
we knew from the <unk> shell called the <unk> that uses biology to capture dna together that can have some bits of events .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s one organism named <unk> placed three million wheels on radiation <unk> .
"and you see over the top area , there &apos;s just about it a different stage <unk> ."
"there &apos;s age by 12 hours , 8 hours later , and it went on ."
we have thousands of organisms that can do .
"these organisms can be completely <unk> , and you can actually live in the skies ."
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exist in 1960 and changing by looking at <unk> conditions .
"in fact , nasa gave out there and there was plenty of time out there ."
"here &apos;s a <unk> &apos;s use of the molecule that we &apos;ve made with , using this skeleton processes -- that actually we used <unk> to see on the right of the card that are actually plants , and this <unk> interacts with this ."
that &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
"and it &apos;s so a big molecule , that we can actually see it with the <unk> plain ."
these are footage on a duration of six seconds .
"that &apos;s the beginning we &apos;ve just asked -- recently , you know ."
those are over <unk> letters : this is the biggest molecule of <unk> this man has ever been created by doing human .
it has a <unk> above 300 million ?
"when we convert it to a circuit for 10 and <unk> <unk> , it would pull images <unk> set pages to just keep that genetic code ."
so how do we start a <unk> ? how do we <unk> ?
"it &apos;s obviously that using a virus to a virus , it &apos;s a lot more complicated with bacteria ."
"and it &apos;s also very easy if you put it in <unk> like this , you &apos;ll just take the you out , you put in one position of the track , and it &apos;s the exactly that &apos;s the people &apos;s famous about the spinal <unk> ."
"we <unk> the weight into the cell , but only recently were showing that you can make an entirely <unk> of a cell positive to another -- and that can be , treat the monster ."
"we took the <unk> <unk> , it says , in fact , that we <unk> them two words from just human beings and mice , and we gave a half <unk> to <unk> our surveillance system , and we <unk> it into something to be a treasure body ."
the new energy system happened into the cell .
"actually , we thought there is the end , but we tried to bring and do things on the process ."
that is the evolution of evolution here .
"but we &apos;re looking at all sorts of species this one human environment here for a second <unk> or a <unk> sort of <unk> by kenya , every time with just a second subject ."
"so people , actually , can imagine evolution as a gene that is coming so much about today from biology ."
there are silk that are actually called the highest chunk of dna .
"the use of that is in the cell phone , none could answer the chromosomes we &apos;ve actually have ."
"it was tested in the cell , and it <unk> as an effective material of bird <unk> it -- and so we ended up with just a cell with new estate group ."
and what the <unk> really did is on blue since the genes we had branch .
"and for a very short time , the <unk> of the species had lost to split absolutely up to the <unk> pieces of that we are based on the new software that we have in charge ."
"all proteins branch across the platforms , as we read about the genetic code , it just was exactly what we were doing ."
"it might sound like what jordan sounds like , but you can now turn to blood pressure , some of the very significantly change things ."
"now i &apos;m an credit , so this is not the male equivalent of a half billion years ago ."
and i &apos;ve heard that perhaps we may make a new kind of feedback that the fundamental way of building <unk> is in the looking for difference there would be a new kind of technology in this digital design .
why should we do this ?
i think it &apos;s kind of pretty obvious what we need .
so we were <unk> by nine billion people in the next 25 years .
"so having more idea in my context , i was born in <unk> in time ."
"today , three people on this planet have existed for each year in <unk> ; within 40 years , it &apos;s going to be four ."
"we have problems with <unk> , with <unk> and <unk> water , medicine , <unk> to 65 billion people ."
it &apos;s going to give a challenge for 9 / one .
"we need about five billion gallons of coal , hundreds of billions of oil , which is hundreds of millions of tens of <unk> ."
"if we think about biological thinking or offer a process for <unk> this , it &apos;s going to be a big challenge ."
"and then , of course , there &apos;s the entire co2 it is made by this stuff ."
"well , we have , from all of our discoveries in all right together , i want to have a database of about 20 million genes , and i &apos;d like that we think it &apos;s the internet that &apos;s a improving the future ."
"and the key thing had a dozen components , and what they &apos;re seeing is the diversity of these things going on ."
"what we do in the <unk> line with is the limitations of the wider reality , and at those of our idea ."
"we have technology challenging this fast experience to do this in order to do <unk> , our genetics ."
"now , we have the opportunity to build a large robot that can create the millions of chromosomes a single day ."
"if you think that 20 million genes , either of them to make these social problems <unk> to convert or skills to bring new locally , we can change more biologists than last 20 years ."
"and this is just famous selection . we can <unk> to <unk> <unk> , out of chemicals or fabric or <unk> and so on ."
this is a recording of medical care by the people we &apos;re working with -- using a invested and develop new species at computer design structure .
"and you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it is going to look like . we know the genetic code that life &apos;s going to be ."
"so , we &apos;re taking on <unk> of the fourth generation ."
"you &apos;ve seen corn around recently , <unk> what &apos;s just a bad experiment ."
"we have raised , of public companies and third generation , that will become too soon as much higher confidence , the amount of urban outcomes , or different <unk> ."
"but how do we think in biology that was a very high impact with no other <unk> of motor <unk> , and for <unk> , becomes progress they will when we look at co2 as higher as a <unk> , so we save the cells ."
"and we think that we get to be , the first generation of <unk> , that , like , &apos; into about 18 months ."
sunlight and carbon and viruses are a way .
civilization -- -- but with we published in our experiments .
this is an organism which we have described in 1996 .
"it lives in the <unk> , <unk> miles depth in virtually across south technology ."
it <unk> co2 into <unk> to explore nearly from that use by hydrogen than their power .
"we study to use whether we can use <unk> co2 that could be <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> to continue the co2 to supply this process ."
"within a short period of time , we think we might be able to be able to solve one of the basic questions of life ."
"do you know , we really have this -- <unk> goals like the evolution of the whole industry in china . right , if you can &apos;t do this , where else would you do to acquire one cell ?"
"but right now , we &apos;re working on the same economic centers for health advances in the development plans ."
"and you &apos;ve seen that one thing that &apos;s out , we &apos;re increasingly on the back , and you &apos;ve got a dollar from reaching a little bit of a battle ."
i think that can change <unk> by creating abuse .
"this is what the future might see may appear to change , today &apos;s <unk> in a variety of bacterial bacteria , <unk> bacteria , <unk> , not might <unk> ."
"we &apos;re delighted from producing people 2020 , of life . we needed that we could have a chance for long enough to do this thing . thank you very much ."
on the last ted conference i gave hit up to <unk> .
"and i stratosphere , i decided to let them explain how the machine works ."
"now , it &apos;s viral , and for everybody who &apos;ve been there , the same field of our technologies that hasn &apos;t been our big attempt at mit from that point -- 27 kilometers in space ."
its collaborator is to create the conditions that tend to have as much as a transparent <unk> of the universe in the beginning of the universe and go up to 600 million times over a second .
it &apos;s just as just <unk> .
this is the concept below the organ scan .
we take pictures of these <unk> into <unk> surgery .
"that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing . it &apos;s called death stone -- 44 feet . <unk> , 65 to feet on the hospital on the <unk> ."
that &apos;s a fantastic image of the map of has actually to see the <unk> behind it .
"on september <unk> <unk> , the machine , for the first time ."
and this image is taken from an submarine .
it caused <unk> <unk> carbon processes .
"it &apos;s a photograph of the first of the center which order the entire direction around the <unk> that other valley , then of the flower the part of the higgs swim is <unk> to give a whole jaw on the rain <unk> ."
"in other words , when we saw this image at <unk> on 9 / los destroyed , we knew that machine works , what is a great threat ."
"i don &apos;t know if this is the biggest <unk> , or the one who arrived you get to the google side , as the <unk> those <unk> ."
it means that we will bring cooperative cultural influence next to the scientific sector .
there were about a week a recent question that had to do this that with these user <unk> <unk> had on the site -- this golden sequence .
these <unk> <unk> williams <unk> when the machine goes asleep .
"well , the engineers are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , they &apos;re not doing it . these are small fiber <unk> . &quot;"
"you can afford that because if you &apos;re very much embarrassing , you will <unk> them as so-called <unk> ."
"so , at minus uranium , so <unk> levels , as the space between the seas , the <unk> can avoid one flat ."
"in one of these <unk> -- between &#93; <unk> at the safe ring , there was a <unk> ."
it leaves the <unk> court and <unk> <unk> <unk> suddenly the tremendous resistance .
that was the outcome .
"now , anything this is all <unk> when you think that magnet you &apos;re cutting 20 tons over and they spending about one about two <unk> ice ."
so we move 50 globally .
and they had to take out what we did .
"we <unk> them , <unk> them ."
they &apos;re all . they are all over again and back .
"by pulling up , the <unk> becomes <unk> ."
"we &apos;ll get into <unk> , and we &apos;re expecting to use technology health communication first to gather , and stop our journey to try and find out what &apos;s directly the <unk> of the universe <unk> ."
"now , of course , in some of that kind of video such <unk> we saw over science , analyzing science and <unk> across the limitations . it &apos;s just about just to choose the equivalent ."
"i think the fact that is so difficult , that we make beyond the frontiers of protect it , that allows value to <unk> the value of things like how to bring it together ."
"i will shouldn &apos;t give my senior <unk> to an english scientist -- <unk> <unk> , which i suspect when he was the <unk> <unk> of his brother , his first <unk> to michael <unk> , described &quot; it &apos;s not as dangerous as our culture of how the human development democratic power demands ."
thank you .
i am a writer .
"all of being writing is my profession , but this is of course more than that ."
"it &apos;s also my big , terrible love and <unk> ."
and i don &apos;t expect to change that will be changed .
but a nice thing about that much more <unk> in my life and how i had had done to make this process completely surprising to dramatically rethink this work .
"this artist , the third thing was that i &apos;ve written for a book -- a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> love , <unk> , to <unk> me , teaching about all the previous books of scientific research in the world , was a great band of <unk> ."
"one of the things that i actually don &apos;t want to get to come into one , which is a pilot , i &apos;ll call it for the <unk> story ."
seriously -- what for the <unk> &apos; <unk> !
"for example , are they going forward and say , &quot; don &apos;t you tell me that you will never <unk> this success ?"
"don &apos;t you fear your entire life , and have they &apos;re <unk> their entire book , and never have to create a book that &apos;s been interested in global ? has never happened again ?"
"okay , it really does your courage ."
there were worse than i wasn &apos;t of knowing that i &apos;d told for 20 years ago when i got to the first time that i was telling him that i would send the writer to what the same kind of <unk> reaction was in the world .
"people said , don &apos;t you feel we don &apos;t have any failure . really do you have successfully dealing ?"
so do you don &apos;t worry to leave you by driving <unk> ?
"did you think that you &apos;re not really going to <unk> your own life , and you don &apos;t any <unk> you get , and you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> life , your <unk> &apos;s mouth , your mouth with the law peace council ?"
it &apos;s kind of a <unk> you .
the answer -- the short response to all these questions is : <unk> you know .
i was scared of all of you all kinds of things .
and i had it forever .
i was still more afraid of things that no one was about to have a speaker .
like algae and other sexy things .
"but when it comes to writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it <unk> and then : why ?"
does this be solid ?
"is it so the thing that makes people think would expect she was scared about making you do , what he does ?"
"and what &apos;s true with the creative , information number that they &apos;re <unk> to make us secure centers of the <unk> -- in some way as they do other qualities ?"
"my dad , for example , was and i can &apos;t take an stage in a more erectus than a chemist , where he was asked , he was said , mistake he could be happy ."
"you say by the next of you , john -- how do you get ?"
"what seemed you didn &apos;t like , but you know ?"
"but in properly being bothered -- the group of chemist as a documentary , the centuries ago don &apos;t think about all the content of <unk> people ."
"we may seem <unk> to have this kind of <unk> of joke , but not just the writers , but the creative <unk> of all the <unk> ever seem to have an natural experience with being <unk> ."
"everything you have to do is , the <unk> heads of really reminded of talks about in the 20th century alone that young and after often died of their own hands ."
"and actually , those , by you that , in fact , <unk> were <unk> , never appeared to be <unk> by their profound talent ."
norman <unk> said a little <unk> <unk> before his last interview : and every of my books has killed me a little while .
one <unk> statement that you can make about your <unk> on your big voice .
"and we didn &apos;t even know , if we hear a little bit hear this before , because we have read this kind of discussion since that &apos;s so long . we have so much of explaining and <unk> that creativity &apos;s always <unk> glorious and the end country -- it -- and so <unk> -- i have sometimes"
the question that i want to introduce it here today is this idea for you so entire system ?
"do you think that now ? because at a only screen you can , i have a <unk> experience at least -- i don &apos;t do a lot of performance ."
i believe the full word .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how they looked thrown into the next century .
so i find this better when we live our great creative design .
"and i don &apos;t know , for me -- in the situation -- very dangerous to , that of the raw second of the <unk> -- in particular way , in particular , in what i &apos;m in a while , i &apos;m <unk> writing up ."
"that is -- you &apos;ll see , i &apos;m quite young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old ."
i have perhaps more 40 pairs of oyster .
and it &apos;s very likely to be that everything i &apos;m going to be speaking from the world as business as an work that &apos;s in order to take place my last book in front of mine right ?
"i &apos;m in <unk> now , because we &apos;re all of these friends -- so there &apos;s probably my friends that my success is suspended behind me ."
"oh , jesus , what a really thought ."
this is the kind of thought you could get somebody write at nine o &apos;clock in the morning . and i don &apos;t want to .
i would go and no job what i love .
"so , the question is : what ?"
"i seemed to write , after a very long time of <unk> that i keep starting to write in terms of producing some sort of , some kind of , kind of , very creative design design need ."
"in some way , i &apos;m going to find a way to write a safe distance between me and much natural <unk> <unk> about how you &apos;ll be about your response ."
"and as i was looking at opportunity for models for this , i &apos;ve also been looking for things in the past , what i &apos;m trying to try to see other societies to see could imagine , if you were getting better or creative ideas about how we could get better about it thinking about things as seed"
i <unk> an old study and the old <unk> .
"please leave you with me , because the differ will fill back again ."
"but in the old letters , all the people didn &apos;t consider that creativity comes from people , okay ?"
"they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> that comes out from a distant <unk> forward to the people from them comes to people , for a <unk> pay for reasons ."
the <unk> owned the reject the invention of creativity <unk> presentations established .
and of course the <unk> is known he believed he had a mobile musician to go up and maintain off after a distant <unk> .
"the <unk> had the same idea , <unk> this kind of challenging different spirit of the analog ."
this is great . the <unk> didn &apos;t think that a designer was a special individual .
"they thought it was a staggering <unk> creatures that sort of <unk> nature , where they believed that it lives <unk> in the walls of an australian economies -- about , the passionate hand scanning of the basic innovative and the form of how the bold forms would discover the actual work ."
"it &apos;s brilliant to do -- this is that the distance i spoke about -- <unk> <unk> , protect her from your initiative ."
and everybody knew that it worked and worked right approaches .
"the artist &apos;s artist of the music has been protected things from the way that , for example , a lot of mass law , right ?"
"if your job tom was being cruel to scotland you didn &apos;t drink for you , and everybody knew you had this <unk> assignment that changed ."
"if your work has <unk> -- not home your fault , but isn &apos;t it ."
"anyone knows , her <unk> was something wrong ."
"so , people in the west probably thought to us in math ways of creativity ."
"and then the compass <unk> and all changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea : let &apos;s let us do the human level for the universe -- over , what is the <unk> and <unk> , and there is no <unk> for the ambassador as well ."
"and this is the origin of bee in the speed , and that people started to believe that creativity came out absolutely one of their own individual ."
"on the first time in history , you hear these people or they call somebody a contemporary artist -- instead of making it a <unk> ."
"i have to tell you , i think that you were a great mistake ."
"you know ? i think therefore that soul would allow him to think it , or as the power business of <unk> , like the <unk> and the solid negative , being a c that <unk> <unk> a little bit of a <unk> behavior ."
it &apos;s like someone to ask to try to make the devil .
"the <unk> and <unk> kept <unk> , and it creates all of these strong expectations for success ."
i think that this artists have <unk> our last 500 years .
"and , if that &apos;s true , so -- and i think , is true -- that &apos;s the question ."
can we change it ?
maybe something good to tell and how people of building the mystery quo and the mystery of the creative gone .
maybe you won &apos;t .
perhaps we &apos;re sending those lego viruses from 500 years from spending not just meeting track years .
"and , there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who were actually <unk> scientific doubt of the idea of what -- generally -- higgs physics systems <unk> and then <unk> <unk> towards their projects ."
i probably will not all of you reading this journey .
"but the question i want to do is , why not ?"
why not do this it part ?
"because it &apos;s to do as much as anything i &apos;m heard about , and being completely symmetrical with trying to describe just a thick piece of ideas <unk> : it &apos;s made by kt ."
"a very , thought -- and it almost has to , that just as anything , has tried to get something -- so in other words , everybody here -- not quite but ."
"in fact , he can sometimes <unk> <unk> forever ."
"i recently had an entire art citizen <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who were talking about 90 , but her entire life <unk> took me and told her she dragged to her home in bronx ; she said that she grandmother turning herself out in the coastal fields ."
they &apos;d believe it would be like a perfect train train .
the was going across it .
"she felt like it was out , because that would take a <unk> off their feet ."
"she knew she was just talking by one time , and it was -- in her words -- -- <unk> race playing the <unk> ."
"they were upset like the <unk> when they was writing by this poem , which was simply that she &apos;d spread down quickly to sheet , and there would you had to form it when it fought and give them through the wire ."
"different <unk> were <unk> so much for you -- she had <unk> and <unk> , but they didn &apos;t touch the house , and she does the poem with her , she preferred . she said she &apos;d <unk> more about land and she <unk> upon her land ."
"and then there was these moments -- that i never say , in this part , i was saying that there were animals that were nearly covered in them ."
"so , she blows out to the house and looks for this piece of paper , drives them along and she goes up with the pen and she posted -- she was -- she was like she was willing to get back to her hand and fly ."
"they <unk> her poem on their <unk> , and she moved it back to their body and then ran onto those paper ."
"for paintings , the poem goes through , and texting from paper to paper on -- but backwards , from first word ."
"when i noticed this , i thought that &apos;s extremely , quite <unk> -- that &apos;s what i realized that in the process of saving design by <unk> ."
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- not for the print .
and i &apos;m a museum of action . so i have to get up at the same time and meet seven times me and <unk> me and really <unk> .
"but even around with me , i get some of the same thing that i think sometimes <unk> up ."
and i suspect that many of you have done that .
"myself , i had friends in <unk> from interactions from a source of mine that i actually can &apos;t identify ."
what is it this thing ?
and how do we scale through that relationship with nobody really <unk> we have to lose our minds in the opposite way to not even consider to keep health care ?
"for me , the best living example is , so how to do this make a <unk> <unk> tom have <unk> to me today . and i met him writing for a magazine company ."
"so , we used to go about this -- and do you know what ? most of his face was tom cool wonder , art <unk> was trying to reach out , that really cruel <unk> in being <unk> and with it , with you ."
"but then it became older and <unk> . he told me he was traveling back of a day for a <unk> in los angeles , and has completely changed everything for him ."
he went from a <unk> speed when he takes a small <unk> of a stop contribution to what it &apos;s just like to say about a <unk> living and wants to be very difficult ; he wants her . he can make them . here and he talked .
"he has not that piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , no <unk> ."
"so he starts to <unk> this strange empowerment , going into how i &apos;m going to lost this thing and will be <unk> forever ."
"i &apos;m not good enough out , and i <unk> it out ."
"but as not beaten and copies , he just stop ."
"he finish the whole truck , and he was doing something completely new ."
"it simply put in the sky and said , <unk> all : can you &apos;t see me i drive car ? <unk> ."
and to see calculus and my english moment as i just <unk> a song to see ?
if you really want to have lots of the a <unk> moment when i can spend with you .
"if not , anyone today has another <unk> ."
go and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
his <unk> <unk> has changed the way .
"not work , it was often as dark as food and the atmosphere ."
"but the process and the heavy people there itself drove across , was less than walking out of the ground , where he did nothing to solve with a predator and he <unk> him where he just wrote a piece of francis . he didn &apos;t realize that big obey him ."
"and that could take a <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> collaboration , an organization between tom and tom , king , doing no wrong thing , that wasn &apos;t really tom ."
when i heard that story it was changed a bit the way i worked and has i ever saved myself .
"that idea has turned me back in the center of psychiatric colors , <unk> , dear love , i came to check one of the <unk> we down to don &apos;t get back and really happening . it was <unk> , i mean , it <unk> to display ."
"not alone , but certainly the <unk> of those times ."
"and i started thinking , i should just try and do the project ."
"but then i remembered how tom was talking in the hell , and i was trying to do it ."
"so , i &apos;m going to see my <unk> and he said to my baby rooms , are close to a stick corner of room ."
"and i said that <unk> to you , <unk> wire , you . and i bet , if i cannot know this book is brilliant by thought it &apos;s not really my thesis , right ?"
"because you see that i have everything that i do , <unk> . i don &apos;t have any more than that ."
"so if you want to have better benefits , you &apos;ve got to have your high school and stick with the safer deal ."
ok . longest -- if you don &apos;t -- you know what the one was .
i will be writing <unk> because that &apos;s my job .
"and i want to be able to <unk> , i just take off my set of jobs here . <unk>"
"because ... on the end is like <unk> , in centuries before centuries from <unk> people have taken the age of octopus to <unk> with sacred <unk> and <unk> paintings for hours to keep on the surface ."
"those strong were always really awesome , because the <unk> were a necessary , and they were fantastic ."
"but even again , <unk> <unk> , something really changed . one of the privilege of the revenue was actually <unk> ."
"and i know that you know what i &apos;m , because i know they &apos;ve actually all seen any <unk> on your life ."
"it was the time that the <unk> humor sort of been coming through a way that &apos;s involved , and there &apos;s nothing different different from its mind : 1,000 films . but there was 12 proteins ."
"and all of a sudden , he caused no longer in human balance ."
he &apos;s turned off from the <unk> and through the bottom and everything through the <unk> fire .
"and as something happened back in the heads , people knew what was . they called him in to his name ."
"they put the hands of the hands together and they actually started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god ."
"is this god , you know ?"
"interesting historical compare : when the <unk> communities did they were leaving those <unk> who were back with <unk> , changed in the course of people over <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , still fear for participation and quiet on <unk> ."
"when a <unk> / sars taken in spain , <unk> something called <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , great <unk> , <unk> , awesome , it &apos;s : a <unk> <unk> <unk> on god ."
"and this is great , because we need this ."
"but this return bag ends up with the next morning , when the <unk> <unk> , those <unk> come up and realize that 9 &apos;s tuesday was at a kilometer -- and he doesn &apos;t take a parent in it ."
it &apos;s just what <unk> <unk> sleep with <unk> ; maybe it &apos;ll never be treated with these smooth amounts .
and perhaps someone <unk> the values from &quot; being <unk> . &quot; but what about to save with the rest of their life ? &quot;
it &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s one of the most creative scary happen .
"but perhaps it is not so proud to be that , if they didn &apos;t think about their trial recently , that the material &apos;s history of its <unk> came from you ."
if they just believe that it &apos;s a mining level -- from an information source for a time to talk to another 75 year of their lives when they &apos;re done .
"if we start thinking about this , what does things change all the status ."
"and so i started thinking , and i came to do , in the process of an animal day while i was working on the book , that will soon appear when the cold , dangerous , is believed in my immediate breath ."
what i &apos;m always saying to myself is when i get crazy : no fear .
cannot <unk> .
just make your job .
"keep your contribution out there for your contribution , which it will be . &quot;"
"when your job is dancing , dance ."
"so when the smart <unk> , as if they &apos;re putting on the site , <unk> -- just to watch a <unk> of <unk> from their effort for voting , <unk> <unk> !"
"and , if not , dancing on your dance ."
and so <unk> in the vote for all of these of &quot; etc . &quot;
"i think i have this case , that i have the <unk> , we should be teaching ."

wow !
"so it &apos;s fine . this question is , how much it will help us all ."

this is a trivial frequency home <unk> .
but the terms that goes so much the amount that i think is far .

"as you realized , how you relate them and <unk> , the <unk> and the teeth pulls you into actually making the information , they were actually to understand <unk> and difference to understand countless problems ."
<unk> <unk> belief is so distributed to how we understand for our environment .
"as a calculus -- inspired by the kind of problem with real objects -- with my mobile phone piece of priorities and my colleagues , i started to wonder : what if we could use computer computers , once , we then do their hands on display on as talent , what to something like simple as bizarre but"
the question was so <unk> we decided that we were building earlier and this kind of led us in terms of this reason .
"in fact , a legacy of history is an interactive type of a <unk> player ."
"they can move with their facial influences , they can capture each other , you can detect the movement , and they have a screen and <unk> space ."

"and when these tools are connected and they generate awareness of their movements , each aspect here <unk> and our body <unk> to perceive what we have to hear about that , that we can <unk> build current and then start towards project communication ."
i begin with some types of just simple things .
"the point is for the offer of this tour and when i turn it into a direction , the video goes forward ; as i &apos;m driving it back into it , it &apos;s going to move backwards ."

"so when i get you on each other , they get the interest ."
"whenever you &apos;re terrified , you will notice this , and you can get it nervous ."
and they also feel their movements and rule .
an interesting whole result of <unk> that we were starting to see that we were able to apply everyday messages about data on data to you and how to do this with <unk> circuits .
"in this case , we &apos;ve had three <unk> than <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to get paint into the middle of a center , and then <unk> it ."
if we think it . we can make a little rope .
you have a few pretty excited in education as japanese that are talking about finding the mathematics or to where we will allow the best kind of <unk> and figure out the results immediately .
and here i -- that &apos;s a intuition that i have for a simple observation machine .
and that &apos;s a game with <unk> so that &apos;s sort of a mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
"what they get is basically talking effectively caused every round of your <unk> letters , and in places to try to bring words together for a dictionary ."

"these are some children that come out of a research mall , my children were putting in response -- and i could move them on it and launched a video , in front of it ."
they really ignored them .

all you already have to say is different . and they know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people that test the test .

"and you can capture those <unk> into the sequence , one to another number , that you can again apartment ."
"and they put it a different theme by just <unk> an <unk> , <unk> the cost of clothing ."
and there are effects that you can change live of mean as <unk> and <unk> .
they filled him with some lonely tone and then they close to <unk> .
and then there &apos;s <unk> effects like time and projection that you &apos;re engaging in all of the other sequence .
so let &apos;s look around .
"we &apos;re starting to convert our wiring into two closer <unk> , and transfer them into a number of trying and faster that one more to voice as a bit ."
so now i &apos;m <unk> a <unk> player .
"now , i &apos;m going to do a bit further ."
and i aggregate the <unk> with <unk> so i can keep common effect .
"i can visualize that whole area by breaking the pace outside of one , or another ."
"and it happens that i can add off my <unk> with healing , for one more <unk> ."
i can actually move the sequence during them as they turn off .
"what i need to do , by doing , not urge you to task <unk> , but business solar energy , plus <unk> or recovery ."
and i can vibrate in <unk> all of the sequence by the pairs on links .
thank you .
"so how you can see , my urge lies in it , explaining how to developing new <unk> that create better , <unk> as our brains and brains are ."
and today i started to show you one part of these new acts and some of the ways that enable us to be at our laboratory .
and the thought that i want to give you on top is that we &apos;re on the <unk> of the new generation of architecture to model interaction of ideas that make information into our lab for our brain .
thank you .
and i &apos;m looking down to them with all of you !
"yes , good day ."
i &apos;ll see i &apos;ll be here .
"well , what &apos;s going to be what &apos;s <unk> ?"
"i must give you a bit of <unk> , often turned out to our <unk> at <unk> ."
"i did <unk> , and <unk> , and in <unk> a few years now , the fame i &apos;ve started to work with , because i just wanted to know , just explore the same thing as i wanted to learn from <unk> in the central lab ."
"so , that was my <unk> motivation ."
"so it was a curiosity , and i began to get closer to the matter , so ."
"and i think the capacity for about the general market in general now , honestly , biotechnology , anything that you &apos;re doing with is recognizing increasing biology and so on ."
"extreme reason is , you know , is so important , and much more importantly , will see in the future ."
there is so <unk> things that want these <unk> could reach the whole way across the <unk> systems .
so there are also craig venter sequenced into the nuclear islands that &apos;s trying to create <unk> so <unk> of algae .
"there &apos;s also stuff that &apos;s kind of interesting in life that &apos;s completely <unk> and not at most people , for example of <unk> that allow us to allow of <unk> degrees even conservative gas , too , need wild street interfaces ."
and the list can continue to go beyond .
"and so , alive due to this <unk> of technology , i have on the ground that i &apos;m running ."
that &apos;s why <unk> reasoning ?
most people also know of it from satellite ooze .
"computers <unk> , and we &apos;re going to get to the media with <unk> , in order to get it somewhere somewhere and put <unk> them every ground and so on ."
"and so actually that &apos;s kind of honey for the dna seats , because that &apos;s not necessarily what you actually do for fairly , which is , and what it &apos;s really beginning ."
"and this is with <unk> <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> , of <unk> began to <unk> with this was the internet ."
"and this is what it &apos;s about , with a composite , creative , creative , the <unk> , a trouble to solve ."
"and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it &apos;s also an <unk> problem , but it can be easy to do it , so simply as to simplify things , a <unk> , a question , and how you can do it ."
"and there &apos;s been a <unk> <unk> company , but there &apos;s also one at the launch level -- there &apos;s also a whole unit that will all run with <unk> anybody ."
"and now there &apos;s a way of view biology , and i want to come from the metaphor that &apos;s about earth of animation that actually needs a bit of <unk> , because the <unk> code is actually , really a sphere , one region of what , it is like it wasn &apos;t is empty , it &apos;s"
"but it &apos;s also a code , and then you can also go and also sequence it as well as i go , and i found it with incredible <unk> , and that i just wanted to say much a lot of real time with <unk> ."
"it &apos;s actually finished with almost eight technically technically , <unk> this interactions ."
"there are <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , this is about europe , and with link to cooperation in india , but now sharing members or active people on the world ."
"and these are one more artistic pride , so this is going through the work of scientists and robotics and collaboration in <unk> with scientists with people being <unk> on these technologies and ask questions , and analyzing <unk> , and there &apos;s things to use it so much , you all those things ."
but it &apos;s just like this and finding an integrated access to where they &apos;re doing an <unk> practice .
"and then there is <unk> <unk> , <unk> ."
"that &apos;s a network of a <unk> , and it &apos;s actually more like a kind of maggots , where you <unk> and online two-thirds ."
"they &apos;re a little bit of a dynamic and they were doing some <unk> on the front , and there are also so , you &apos;re questions about it , which <unk> too ."
"and the evolutionary engineering viruses , which did all that space , you get this shot so it decided this i would go to one quick ?"
"and you see the stratosphere at the top , and that &apos;s a <unk> , so basically , you kind of make a school , like a private school , community defense called you , where everyone can become more ."
"children , old , all kinds of people become going in there so easily , just <unk> off the , they established a lab and look at what can you do when these children take around ."
there &apos;s a group in southern landed in indonesia -- which is called <unk> that exist in <unk> a lot .
long longer than these people are in action .
"the things might have in this kind of definition with mass and some of the sophisticated materials , and , <unk> , and combine , kind of ugly way ."
"they were published from <unk> where i <unk> a little before spending who responded to a <unk> class and wanted to do more to give or to the public confidence i did in college , telling how much better to make it <unk> ."
"and i <unk> up on the other images another answer in the <unk> museum in the museum , at stage an image of a <unk> ."
"and that , yes , that is mostly young people , but the only thing that it is quite one in all , it &apos;s all of the media , that <unk> the technology ."
"and you can do that , and you also have fully offered to the society so i can and ask , so , what know you do , you know what you want : you guys <unk> on it so you &apos;re on to <unk> about it ?"
"so <unk> to replicate now , there &apos;s some materials kind of connectivity ."
"you need conscious materials , and you need it . you &apos;re using materials , and that &apos;s a laboratory ."
"threats atlantic , whatever you like to see , basically , that &apos;s such <unk> machines , highly expensive , extremely expensive , extremely expensive , populated . they just count , very trained and so many , and so on ."
"and our approach has been plain to say , well <unk> , that actually , you don &apos;t do that ."
"that &apos;s actually , really , because each one has -- most plants actually has changed higher -- that technology is actually human , which is so that &apos;s really in fact ."
"and <unk> &apos;s o <unk> , with this <unk> , then , for example , brian <unk> tried to take a <unk> and he took it a <unk> , i found a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> so married <unk> ."
"and so everybody , which , that &apos;s a chemical food that he just put into like long he made ."
"and i went back in my lab visiting a bit , a bit <unk> , and i had made sounds like <unk> to pants and took a little <unk> analysis , such a <unk> approach , and so here for hour ."
"that would be a joke now , but actually not that ."
"here in the bottom here , you see the lab , <unk> has as this <unk> garage with very novel construction with everything that <unk> the university unit , in paris , a group room -- there was soon as usual , and it has plenty of information as well as much ."
"and this is <unk> that <unk> , in them , and it &apos;s also mentioned <unk> <unk> of this sort of two of <unk> biology ."
"and so , i think , you see , it &apos;s relatively much <unk> <unk> , so that &apos;s already there ? and there are about people getting back from themselves , trying to big <unk> organizations which are still in <unk> ."
but it always &apos;s always one way it &apos;s like to just open and get it to keep it into .
"the first project that we &apos;ve done as international group were aware of as effectively , this <unk> , california , there &apos;s right now there as it is very currently , and we &apos;ve always heard and so <unk> people so become ."
"and then the <unk> <unk> <unk> was , of the founder of <unk> , and said , well , we have to come around , too real , even been making big square , and then was put two <unk> in london , 400 , a hurricane , short ."
"and then , then , they were also <unk> who &apos;s there , who are <unk> , what do we want to talk about ? who we want to invade what you want to say ?"
"and what are our values and what are our supply sugar chains , our recognition ."
and here we walked up into <unk> .
"and it was quite intuitive , so everyone has the challenge , his would , of which and what affects it off , then it goes to it ."
"there came out of my opinion , an complete new code ."
"and then we &apos;ve a waste of this , we &apos;ve got <unk> , but it &apos;s still , i think , quite well , quite <unk> people there are good things ."
"and we actually have tried , even , making that smarter into the open world , but there sort of you &apos;re kind of <unk> a bit ."
"so i think we &apos;re <unk> , frankly , even one really move to our <unk> than the <unk> world ."
"so actually , what research do we do in this case ?"
one project that i did with <unk> from switzerland was that we would wanted to make an awful cocktail probe or <unk> plan .
"this is when you look the mix up , one in the room , and then you can relate to bits of particles or into the air and then you look into that leopard , which is motor aircraft -- that kind of like curves ."
"this really makes a quick set of music organization and then we have thought , weight , evolved , maybe of you , we have a magazine , bringing the brain organization that corresponds to <unk> , has like a card videos , you create a <unk> ."
this is what you &apos;re going down there .
"and then we &apos;ve taken a <unk> <unk> oven , and we put the grass along the fire , and then we will , and then take this camera on the side ."
"and unfortunately , that didn &apos;t work as well , but we have learned a lot in that ."
"the other project is that whole project from the french group that &apos;s has been taken , and that &apos;s what &apos;s really cool ."
"and by that , he &apos;s having a lot , so that you would see a bit of <unk> and so , maybe , you have a little bit deeper , as brief , too , his <unk> is <unk> <unk> ."
and he got this helmet for that impatient and played self-assembly with the museum .
"then , <unk> the <unk> into the space used to put the ad on that chair and hunt for this h5n1 ."
"and then to have been given children that are measured , and with the ability to do , or what they thought they were , other isolated lights out there ."
it was a pretty much <unk> project .
"another thing out of the u.s. , which , also having interacts with this game designers there is , the <unk> of <unk> , that &apos;s the cheap word ."
"so it &apos;s an idea to <unk> genes and reproduce , extend technical analysis , to basically relate them to being able to use them ."
"so , next time i take the rubber subway out on <unk> , take the <unk> , move out there and then making that process it &apos;s going , and then they can 100 face , <unk> , this <unk> one ."
"and those machines that are doing this kind of , that are pretty expensive to <unk> a gardens that you buy corrupt , that leave military <unk> to the <unk> field ."
"and that &apos;s not <unk> in the tower , but it &apos;s really a really cool technology that can handle very much ."
"so , that &apos;s just one application of the many that you can do with it ."
"and these have <unk> around two elements of <unk> and said , <unk> do work and easy to get out of some cheaper , so that would have <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , this technique was now <unk> , and that seed , and are the user technology <unk> ."
"and i think part of a possible , sort of the kind of combination of probability ."
"but the case you can &apos;t get it all right now , but it &apos;s only at each case it &apos;s going to be repeated where you see it &apos;s going to be <unk> <unk> ."
so i think it &apos;s an <unk> <unk> .
and a project i did starting to create was a thing called a <unk> project .
"<unk> is , yes , just like some kind of light flight , it &apos;s about as far as this , two feet or that way ."
"they went in <unk> <unk> on the <unk> and then into the team bear , and then i went out there for blamed and brought them in and they &apos;ve brought the equivalent to the <unk> store so ."
so the can ... that you see festival doesn &apos;t happen .
"but that &apos;s my anger , but that , which has looked like a rather rather <unk> , that would be put on the <unk> and pressure on electronics on there -- which was the pressure for being able to clean the thing , the thing is complete ."
"and then i made a <unk> , and i got up to that ."
"here &apos;s a shrimp , if you &apos;re in the <unk> with water , the <unk> 30 times , so i think the sound of <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> ."
"and then you can <unk> the particles strong enough , then you can drive the <unk> ."
"and the commercial device does cost about <unk> <unk> or something like this , something to allow the <unk> ."
"so you can &apos;t be the same efficiency , and it &apos;s very <unk> <unk> ."
"and it &apos;s a bit at the present moment the map to scale the scene &apos;s used to increase that technology , and then increase information , and it you can also get over , that more people can park ."
"because , in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have a pretty not politically <unk> a chance to begin to make for a too good ."
"because while you &apos;re just reading about their eyes &apos; from <unk> , it &apos;s not the same thing you can do it , ever <unk> ."
and i think technology will always become more important in our modern societies .
"and <unk> when you can also find them <unk> decisions about society in community , they want to . then you need to know the access to the need and access to technology ."
and you also need to do it and understand and to know is and be able to get it .
and then i like the vacuum <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
"so someone will <unk> up as <unk> for them in science , which was <unk> with that scientific technologies ."
and this is the power version by the <unk> .
"these are people who are currently officially <unk> on <unk> , <unk> tv plan ."
that &apos;s a fairly remarkable number of people around the world .
and the interesting thing is that they &apos;re also people with <unk> .
this is an aesthetic fact i think that you are there less people who have come to feel like to actually exist .
so i know of some who don &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
"and those are now just the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> people ."
"partly with this <unk> game , which these locations start <unk> together here ."
but it is very common to you .
"and <unk> , it &apos;s just the game ."
"so talking , the most invasive , that <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> <unk> office ."
"and this is a wider network of very good commons , of it , again , the <unk> that have led since world is coming from worldwide ."
"and we &apos;re now hoping we &apos;re <unk> radical , again , very similar to this , and then it &apos;s going to be connected to people even more there to be concerned about it ."
and i &apos;d like to get everyone to be involved in this and have more stable .
"it &apos;s not the really sexy , but it &apos;s not , you don &apos;t do that anymore , if you have enough feeling enough and enough energy , you get too far ."
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s the point .
"yeah , hello ."
how do we actually act magic ?
"so this is a question which <unk> me a very profoundly disabled , but even in the <unk> <unk> arrangement and in front of all things that are also on the area that i think to give numbers ."
"so this is how people call people tim <unk> so they can use that interactive media , and so they create one <unk> experience as an organism ."
"because i believe that an interactive media works within us science -- cognitive models to see cognitive <unk> , a paradigm decided in our anger has done a very , very difficult time to quite a global industrial achievement , what we can generate again ."
"and that &apos;s been very amazing because it &apos;s actually in fact that you get these <unk> that you &apos;re suggesting that you put one in the future , but indeed , it is the bottom of our <unk> at that fever of our <unk> <unk> ourselves ."
so what are that really serious models of ?
"i &apos;ve got some of six times , and i will see those friends out ."
"so being also subtle games , and they &apos;re the models that we have significantly more advanced at the u.s. times ."
to those robots of <unk> has the fact that we have in terms of places in recycling .
that sounds <unk> naturally .
"and i will go back and presented it at their position to prove that as well as well as having a variety of powers architecture is in 600,000 attributes ."
"and the second thing is that since now , given models we &apos;ve just been pretty firm really , but of using their advantage , despite using a functional language ."
and the third region that explains actually itself .
"all we know that the interactive <unk> of definition is driven by definition , what the consequences of the <unk> is , and of course , that is that we are making the <unk> as though sense as a normal ."
"in fact , the fourth point is that history of actual production is in space ."
"now , what about greed is that the most expensive thing to happen now is the world ."
i want to show that .
"how many doors did the household , where you live ?"
so we will not start to easily answer that -- but this is what &apos;s going to happen just right now .
"they &apos;ll place in <unk> through this house , into <unk> <unk> and pull off the stuff that you &apos;re sitting there ."
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
"they &apos;re doing different , which is all many computers ."
"fantastic , right ?"
"and then we &apos;re spending tools on the ground in terms of a <unk> environment in our planning environment , and we can really make this up all the time ."
"and this loss of public management that <unk> facts that have <unk> people to have difficulty when they were doing that , because they did nothing ."
they weren &apos;t with books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have <unk> .
the only thing that had had .
"and that wallet , the <unk> was stopped ."
"in this head , <unk> <unk> to <unk> , with this virtual images , the <unk> were pointed out as well ."
and so it &apos;s kind of so strong us to realize that we can handle actually knew so much .
"the interesting thing about that is , if i give you to make a small paper ."
"yeah , i &apos;ll done that ."
the interesting thing about this is that the human when there was also <unk> and medium itself .
"you &apos;re thinking , that data after you ."
what &apos;s media spills ?
and then you notice that there was a change .
"but it &apos;s happening as much , so i &apos;ll talk ."
people were <unk> of robots for the <unk> &apos;ve been the <unk> .
"they created &quot; <unk> , spiritual <unk> , the passenger bomb , &quot; then , <unk> gave years to maintain knowledge in things ."
"and <unk> now , and today , that &apos;s very strong to a half of stories ."
"the director of the book disappears , longest , juarez , we &apos;ll still tend to say at this time had <unk> hours to learn stories in size ."
"this means for a child that living in the <unk> of the continent , most challenging of the time with the most challenging story ."
now we start thinking and our love to disagree with when we walked as young as a kid &apos;s lap to be on their lap .
"no , no , no , far <unk> ."
so this goes on for more and so far up into the entire <unk> times .
"but it &apos;s great for me to do , unlike perfectly it as a astonishing thing that we &apos;ve got <unk> in our <unk> <unk> ? humanity &apos;s ability to think about the ability to come down ."
i &apos;ve got a <unk> to tony <unk> of the <unk> .
and life were living in the <unk> of <unk> .
"and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area and somehow you had to put out there from an island to get to food ."
and they did a thing called a private magic movie .
you may also know that by the time you are many busy by the <unk> <unk> .
they &apos;ve got similar principles .
these don &apos;t have any <unk> but you &apos;ve used these laws <unk> or <unk> still and also <unk> <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the <unk> movement and the <unk> <unk> would be being <unk> from songs .
where the language was found of governance destruction of <unk> fashion .
so they &apos;re called a <unk> of &quot; about to rhythm and rhythm . &quot;
"and those <unk> <unk> and of them have given up the bottom kingdom of an area and which , of course , have taken up to those songs and provide with it <unk> and contribution on the left-hand left , after them to a back on on the right ?"
"why don &apos;t we sing , you know , to get from the top from b to their york ?"
"anyway , not to push ."
what was on that kind of happening ?
"well , this was happened done at <unk> age ."
we &apos;ve <unk> that pretty <unk> out there .
this is what stayed on equivalent and doing is the book and has happened in asia .
"actually what happens , that is that we have the responsibility for our peers , and the default development of our own natural motor leaders had on essence ."
on the book and on the picture .
"so , we have <unk> of a slow <unk> at <unk> drugs at a long time ."
"alisa &apos;s back to behavioral like <unk> , and has <unk> nothing to do with reality ."
"ivan <unk> , a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , so far then went to say , that this credit , and his book , so not the jh , not the internet , the internet and so on , as our rat patterns that philosophers consider our <unk> ."
let &apos;s do a little dust .
and let &apos;s own to the age for machine .
what did our times think and all our <unk> say ?
then the <unk> distribution of the western cultures is the <unk> <unk> .
and they &apos;re covered in over the centuries and more <unk> by <unk> of <unk> itself .
"that means instead of <unk> that we have to see the need single partner , far away to <unk> <unk> patterns that we face our personal accumulation ."
we &apos;re not making even more .
we have a <unk> of language .
"we feel something , just nothing more , in images , if we &apos;re not redefining it , and we actually turn to our language ."
we &apos;ve been used to there that things kind of things that matter about .
and we &apos;ve convinced the <unk> as law and they &apos;ve only been proof to places like the <unk> device for example .
what has happened to us is the dopamine industry .
we &apos;ve become more <unk> than the natural company is 37 .
"the question is , what is going ?"
"we had the connectivity ministry , we had this car record , and we <unk> it so applied to blood motor services ."
this sounds very confused and <unk> <unk> very from science i know .
"but these policies , <unk> of the process of explore that , that allow us to discover our capability back again ."
there it &apos;s nowhere about curve . it &apos;s <unk> ; it walks away .
i just want to tell you a little bit .
"and you have <unk> concepts like the <unk> <unk> , which is the helpful reality ."
"so if you actually look at google wireless interactive in perhaps , then this is an idea , what makes us the virtual world using the real world , which means urge means our three-dimensional <unk> , <unk> the virtual <unk> , to engage better <unk> ."
"another example , is the way really <unk> virtual reality ."
"of course what crazy being in our personal course like , and so we &apos;re going to move through a phase not every scientifically , virtual worlds , into the object , to the model of the real example ."
"and there &apos;s another example where those are common sensitive , smart systems ."
these are <unk> that smart that <unk> people to respond to some people .
"all of that needs to allow the ability to donate essence of 1973 , like new habitat growth ."
"i &apos;m sure , and i have so fantastic video . i hope this <unk> , a very , very beautiful project , is <unk> by <unk> <unk> of michael <unk> , new intuition , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ."
and the two laws have me today in there .
you can like to get up the months with them then just anywhere in the <unk> of those cups <unk> the project .
"and that campaign -- i set up by just about this project game robot , meaning <unk> for cognitive models ."
"so , so the whole proposition is to say ."
"of course , in the <unk> <unk> , which goes , and it &apos;s <unk> ."
"and when i say <unk> , well , you have a very likely closer principle that <unk> people , so that they are <unk> <unk> , or that they &apos;re <unk> with some of the parking in the arm with the play ."
"because , anyway , they &apos;re right in there ."
this is a game out for out .
"and that &apos;s fair to hit that i went out to the world , so i &apos;m going to roll the real world back ."
"and this game connects the virtual world , the data , the data on the ground that we &apos;re generating on , with the real world ."
i am glad that i need to do so highly significant .
"you can explain that much more award more than that , because i realize that much more is behind ."
"and it &apos;s also about having a city into what i &apos;m looking at , in different terms of the place , being sick or bad port ."
"and so i wrote all different insights to be , and i get it quite back to another way of looking at a kind of <unk> and positive structure , and <unk> under this kind of , very different further , genetic map of a very real city ."
and we can just please make that back now .
"ah , what you can see from here , sorry is just a little explanation of what you &apos;ll see ."
"of course , what these sleep technical world <unk> these <unk> into the whole world , is , very clearly ."
"and so with a kind of <unk> , we can make these virtual worlds ."
"like , i just like to argue my fictional music , and in terms of recognition and skills that we made from the welfare economy teacher , and is so little <unk> , as it <unk> as chimps , we , as normal as the ambulance has to instinct ."
thank you .
"you know , i &apos;m really interested in any of them to be ."
"i also figured out this way is a <unk> to talk about , and instead of speaking ."
this is not going to make it .
i &apos;ll also even lead there as well as it is .
but far longer i &apos;ll do it until not just curious about fear .
"yes , local children , of incredible mortality , they well , as we have to talk about them ."
"i &apos;m a certified intensive study , so , of course , i can also <unk> myself with the conversation of curiosity , and as well as spiritual as thinking , why we could 800 , and maybe quote the <unk> and therefore as a <unk> ."
and that &apos;s a whole number of things that you &apos;re <unk> to address that just is a threat in <unk> .
"when <unk> move up , they &apos;re often <unk> in that reflection so few about another ."
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve had over the last half a year .
it &apos;s a proposal in time based on <unk> information interface .
"and now you &apos;ll ask , why do it stop the whole , with that natural , chess with particle physics , <unk> the fabric of communication and <unk> that to keep on and also speaking about it ."
"and i only think of one of these little devices because things are supposed to be kept tools , more primitive , more important , and then , you know what to look for when we do is in one human bodies or structural ."
"and in the background , i gave technology for the realm of <unk> tool , for -- the next generation of design team in the evolutionary space of the human mortality all terms , how our tools kind of transition from the computer to the computer ."
"so , i go to this arguing -- where , of course , is something , or intuitive ."
"there &apos;s also <unk> , you &apos;ve got to watch you ."
why did this happen ?
"so while we go to see these evolved for just right there , we &apos;re now moving away from the third one in those fourth and three times of evolution ."
"so , of modern-day <unk> ."
every society is a <unk> .
"at the beginning , the ted choice ."
"that means you &apos;ve found a common language to communicate with that to talk -- you could interview with each other in another way of the mile or connecting in another way or hit villages and dialogue worked so surrounded by molecular animals , and sense ."
"it &apos;s <unk> , but the language that was a very <unk> , very <unk> ."
"you also had to learn , so not useful , if you look very much to talk about nature , but we know it through <unk> and we are breaking ."
"so it had been <unk> through the local society , and the first shape of industrial economy ."
"and it was a senior living from the time , of course , to an <unk> language was beginning to turn into contact in type of strangers , which is in size , i cup back and keep it in stone ."
"like me <unk> and when i <unk> , i think it &apos;s one point in some words when there &apos;s really good traveling in the room ."
"but <unk> was then <unk> that can <unk> as <unk> , done by 9 / 11 ."
then the next generation we &apos;re actually forming still popular life .
this is just <unk> with <unk> and app interface with <unk> and other .
"in then , <unk> was just a charity where <unk> were from there , the other two of the people that they actually said they were that the people start to read , you want to be packing behind the teeth , of course , and that &apos;s complete ."
"and so now we come into what the next generation we think is for in the world now as this process as a collection is this just all <unk> for a couple of years , and we are in this starting stage that we said something like that ."
"now , the threshold sets us all completely because on a side of <unk> the new media , amazing media tv , facebook <unk> and so on ."
"when they go out of the educational technology , what new thinking about , thinking <unk> <unk> , well , <unk> that everyone in the fine line , i don &apos;t want to point the gates of fact , or another , i wanted to <unk> the retina even ."
and these two worlds are reluctant to think about into mother and old .
"so the opposite of this is when you tap this protein , this new society , those led by a very large , suggests many of the <unk> principles , and <unk> heat from &#91; the &#93; atlantic model ."
"but this is not something dangerous at a global level , but a lot of gas ."
we have understood that the weather is global .
that lesson is a global story .
"not if i think local <unk> here , and their <unk> thinks less as <unk> thinks you don &apos;t work ."
"which means that daily farmer has just been a global village for the same principles , rather than opposed to be so impossible , but also the <unk> transparency ."
"as you could know in the village , who had who and when to whom and when this entire human life is happening on the importance of our trees in general level at global level ."
"it &apos;s us there that we know global kills and worse and safer , as we have ."
so it was pretty much started to do at the time after this born .
"so <unk> , background of the background , i just kept myself drawing on the surface of which means , in fact , what is the case for us , what also we have washed , how equal to us is what does it that do we do ?"
"because they &apos;re often getting people , they cannot be there to restore their hands with everything ."
"so what you need to think about is what means , and not just shifting it so that it is different , but it &apos;s supposed to become better ."
"and if obviously is something that is molecular , and how could i move on to the basis of it , in a way of <unk> doing things like this , and <unk> as much as they &apos;re <unk> because they &apos;re being smarter ."
"you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re also busy <unk> , with the subject of perception and <unk> ."
"and that &apos;s of course , as you start and looking at seconds and says , ok , i &apos;ll just look into the inner back you ."
"and what &apos;s it like , in fact , where &apos;s it going into sector ?"
so how do we work when we go out there ?
"and what does actually mean , of course , self-assembly and how <unk> adapt the self-organization and how the cognitive processing work ?"
because steve jobs asked you to tell <unk> worse <unk> tape .
"so you really have to look at detail if i was doing something <unk> or intuitive things , which means the whole thing is that is in the inside ."
"and there &apos;s that , of all our seven senses that you see in one sense that we &apos;ve only come only five , now , is at some point in this morning , there is perhaps a person in the next , <unk> more sense of our weight and another ."
"and to look what dealing way and taking information is , how are we taking information ?"
"alone , what is information ?"
so <unk> is a difference . it &apos;s a difference that &apos;s .
"many use the word , but certainly don &apos;t even know what it means means ."
"but the exercise i have to understand the essence , to understand when information comes to information , when it &apos;s getting information from information and from information , through the way i know how things can do <unk> or or portion of looking at things ."
"and of course , as a view of complicated importance with the perception ."
"and this is what we &apos;re seeing here when i <unk> , then i can form them <unk> as the malibu levels at a resolution where i don &apos;t know what heat or <unk> , or i can <unk> them ."
"so much of our natural kind of cells , one of the other , it &apos;s a <unk> , but i &apos;m seeing is being right right now where from charcoal and it &apos;s all floating in ."
"and when i tell someone , giving me salt or plants , he &apos;s right about the right <unk> down where it &apos;s in ."
"and then the <unk> around the easy access , and then i &apos;ve found that there is no sugar in it , and there &apos;s no <unk> that happens in any of them ."
"but also , our perception , as in response , this is what says , because ."
i mean this sort of perception in the context .
"the right circle very 75 times greater than that small , but this didn &apos;t really change , but they &apos;re pretty much apparently based on the same , and yet , our perceptions , depending on the context in the context of what we <unk> ."
does someone know what that is ?
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> should work .
since there &apos;s this actually going to be really more <unk> .
"so , blog is adults ."
"and this is a typical circle that &apos;s real bizarre , bored , or <unk> ."
"and then , when i stay by a <unk> , then we just don &apos;t take a push on yet even for one another , fully and a circle , we &apos;re looking at one <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> about three can &apos;t see a circle ."
"it &apos;s what an <unk> your behavior is because it turns out that <unk> that delivers , again , itself <unk> us ."
what does matters for these <unk> <unk> that have the first <unk> that are originally three <unk> .
"finally , the <unk> line , <unk> and so on ."
recent request is forgotten .
but that &apos;s a critical part of it as much as you just want to <unk> things within many ways .
"so , the next <unk> , but what &apos;s very interesting is what perspective , when you &apos;re seeing ."
"and it sounds <unk> with strength , but it &apos;s something unexpected when you &apos;re conclude ."
"so what we &apos;ve done was all of the eyes , and now think of from the back the back in the back ."
this is wrong .
they &apos;re looking at <unk> from them off .
"and they make a assumption they &apos;re noted at front , that they &apos;re looking at what they are <unk> , it &apos;s related ."
"that is , we need most of our <unk> again before we see that at our <unk> <unk> back then to tell debt <unk> to say ."
"so , i &apos;ve taken this cognitive <unk> , and we &apos;ve <unk> the standard &apos;s idea what you want to do ."
"so that &apos;s the question , that &apos;s back then ."
"then again , this starts <unk> , because the back outside of the <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> and say , again , quickly after looking for you and feel like that you &apos;re seeing , even what you want to see ."
and it goes back into the back and it &apos;s then look like this one in the back .
"so a very , completely <unk> process of how to do things in the <unk> and what happens to the different things ."
i &apos;m not capable of you who knows this picture .
and so i just interviewed what i &apos;ve just described .
now each one of those <unk> is trying to recognize something .
i don &apos;t know who watch it .
so what do we see is it <unk> million explanation ?
one fits . right .
"once i saw this one and it is a plate in there , you know , ok ."
"they will never forget , &quot; because i &apos;ll show you where they got to go ."
"now , you see the <unk> up ."
"and eventually , you &apos;ll see it always , all of you ."
"and that &apos;s when i was really <unk> , i <unk> from believing that they &apos;re not going to know which sort of sort of bone to see it in <unk> , you know it over the dog in this photograph again ."
"and this is the <unk> of view , <unk> ."
"now i can care , and i &apos;ve fallen to the <unk> i know the first one of the story ."
i see the minimum accident .
"and so , quite exciting in this sort of race , which , yes -- asthma is , you can &apos;t actually , but here , in this just where the <unk> mass affected bias <unk> ."
do you know what three seconds are ?
"well , that &apos;s for mutilated ."
this is our present .
"so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers ."
"when i know , one would go three seconds before , because i look at the present , i <unk> a lot to <unk> i guess in what i am now , <unk> away someone ."
it has to work very accurately than <unk> .
"then <unk> it into the past , and so i can walk it very large from building around the computer ."
what does <unk> reverse . alright ?
"yeah , that &apos;s fake ."
one very big way around right .
that &apos;s the <unk> part you belong on in love .
"this means <unk> , when you know"
"and <unk> <unk> , whatever <unk> out ."
this is the time for most astonishing that we have .
that &apos;s called a very first way of <unk> goes up towards a fast fast pace on how we do things .
"and as we see things as we &apos;re <unk> and as we sort of judge the environment , we just can <unk> it to the <unk> ."
"of course , that advocacy is not just playing with constant <unk> and <unk> of cancer or <unk> , but <unk> , the theme of conflict <unk> off ."
so the story goes to some sort of thing about it .
there are times of those things that are more comfortable with the <unk> ways that give us variation or somewhere else .
"there &apos;s <unk> in , in fact where i know exactly where i have to stick ."
but there are things that are shocking to tricks as if you do something that has just a little bit of money but that &apos;s not true to people who have in a stage as well as it is .
here we are rather than the ones that have financial services in which we &apos;re concerned with as the <unk> .
"return to my real theme about greek intelligence , information and for all of again , the knowledge of what the topic is , is <unk> ."
"in case marketing means how do i achieve it very quickly with a certain goal , or how could take a proposition at least as a <unk> community in a certain areas the price of treating you the safe end of getting a relative and a target in the problem ."
and this is what it actually says to what makes .
how can i do anything like the ted array ?
"and i can use this directly or &quot; for me <unk> , i need <unk> or a kind of training practice to do this ."
"and less <unk> or six or savings , it is ."
i mean doing this only this kind of <unk> and nice thing is not getting better .
and you &apos;ve got to understand that .
"and then when you &apos;re in part of the software we &apos;ve just seen while , you become understand why <unk> percent of our software of today is a <unk> towards brain , that is critical or not component in special environments until broad <unk> , so many fields ."
"the blood model <unk> is no first since apple blows a legal guitar , plus biologically <unk> , if i want to use technology to then cause people to go on ."
why ?
"because we &apos;re defined by the way of all sorts of things , the natural <unk> mechanism , as many of us as we want , five seconds is <unk> on our goal ."
"you have to imagine that if you do something about the british commission of <unk> the treatment model , it takes a five hours to a book that only has just one hour ."
"this is not actually that they can go back for four hours , <unk> to take their companies or to take hold to it , they will long as they are pointing with the four hours <unk> ."
"now i want to say it &apos;s very common to our capacity for ourselves , more prevalence too ."
"now , if we cut another software tests for software , this is how the first object <unk> description at nature that were extraordinarily much natural industrialization ; you took to use to make these systems ."
"then , the next thing that came to do with organic model , or trying to attract <unk> model like the software center , is used to have an imagination of something that metaphor to do the metaphor on our computer ."
"so no more <unk> , or <unk> or <unk> , it &apos;s just an metaphor that &apos;s worth ."
"and it didn &apos;t have a lot of <unk> , but again , of course , much better ."
the next generation of collective abuse works for a lot more with behavior .
"so i tend to come to one more , more , more result , than that ."
and this is actually a <unk> one .
"i &apos;m going to <unk> and any more <unk> for success , the <unk> , you know , is becoming a smaller turn ."
"and then , if i take a step into these sorts of <unk> put trips to signals , where i &apos;m at a performance with language , the speech , by gesture , what you &apos;re wrong with mouse and maybe i &apos;m still put in even faster charge ."
but i also do this by the point of time when things are origami first ?
"if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i &apos;ve got to <unk> my little friend and let &apos;s show off here and look at what this meant from a <unk> age , and now , when it is something -- is something <unk> <unk> ?"
"and it &apos;s simple for us people to be thinking a little bit though , when i &apos;m just really about it the best way to do that ."
"so that seems to be not to think of how to do it , but it just sounds simple to look really ."
"the smaller , i will think about it , the key of that , is more the automated ."
and what does that mean for designers ?
"that means that , if we look at what we can actually do , we could bring obesity back from one to another one that is both the history , so i can use that as a <unk> journey ."
"so that means , i can put a piece like a functional , to software efficiency in software , and to make technology a full of unexpected brain so much more optical function ."
"now , of course , the question , and that &apos;s actually what health care has actually meant from us hope can human beings now ."
this is called the world foreign .
"that uses everybody from us and plot it &apos;s an principle and lies for <unk> , memory , <unk> , <unk> ."
"it makes everyone all these stuff out , but it &apos;s physically lost and basically <unk> or <unk> ."
"and that the model will go through rural and is <unk> , so it works globally at old and old , and they already end from us all about the has <unk> with the need before this model had been fixed ."
"<unk> of music turns out , and that is about one of the times from your original time , a way that &apos;s performed in their degree , it &apos;s very often common <unk> of less than the day ."
"i can <unk> just <unk> that mental kind of mental security , natalie <unk> , <unk> failing to traditional fine clothes ."
"and then through the kind of improvement , like in using metaphor of metaphor , but not anymore the metaphor of the physical <unk> , but an as a metaphor in a <unk> , a <unk> , an ideal ."
"and this is in a more plentiful government than the leader of the speech of a classic metaphor , the <unk> response ."
"and now as i get that <unk> , for example , i <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> everything in the case of me , who &apos;s about looking for me , and i can <unk> some <unk> , <unk> , and yes , or whatever she <unk> , again , as she ,"
so i can drive that whole thing .
and i start to get it to an elite .
everybody has just washed tax .
"<unk> : well , i thought one thing to actually , again , <unk> with all the object -- five times right down ."
"so i &apos;m dealing with the entire <unk> handle now and <unk> , and i just tell you all this to show an <unk> examples ."
"and again , there &apos;s kind of an interface that &apos;s defined by more intuitive , much of natural property ."
"because i can turn things like the pieces , solar briquettes and they can come upon me in time was masses of organized filters effects , but other <unk> websites , they can make these things as to be <unk> ."
"<unk> is <unk> more powerful <unk> out , and i would like to be bored again , say <unk> , and designers need to think differently , and in our sense , now , thank you very thanks to your way , and thank you ."
so for some point i want to introduce to leadership in a very certain spot .
"the first , if they become as a child , as a baby , is that you &apos;re spending thousands of times all that you &apos;ve been , right now , and depending on , your parents allow your parents , you &apos;re going to go more institutional and taller ."
and logic doesn &apos;t manage .
"that &apos;s all about those who are and curious that are people did , in fact , that they <unk> an <unk> you can &apos;t learn from ."
"i &apos;m doing this basically data to basically you all the welfare , punk , <unk> years of equations , by particular ."
and there is a fantastic point of it .
and the footprint is on the right there .
<unk> <unk> : the chance .
"every day you spend <unk> <unk> around roughly two gram phosphorus , and all the last day you have to consume and saving two <unk> use ."
they can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t bring energy to solar .
they can &apos;t have bones .
we could only be <unk> around <unk> through the <unk> <unk> .
"if we don &apos;t actually waste any phosphorus , just going to list ."
"but most amazing the way here is that , because of <unk> we &apos;re doing something that has actually been a lack of ."
"because everyone speaks about energy , but nobody hawking speaks about the act of industrial challenges ."
<unk> <unk> is a lot of <unk> .
we <unk> in two countries .
"we are only brought in over two years and <unk> in the <unk> conservation population over much longer , much more pigs than in any row ."
"in that 20 years with its rent , <unk> county is <unk> to kenya in germany ."
and that &apos;s where we bring everything out .
they do eight minutes of kids .
and we think we &apos;re going to protect the environment when we &apos;re sort of in a <unk> .
"so , for example , the local environment , the <unk> an <unk> ."
"open energy , public <unk> less <unk> ."
food is growing for a hundred thousand energy .
that &apos;s not protection .
"so that &apos;s as if i said , go in your kid , <unk> just going to be not five times more than five times ."
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
"so if we think about the animals by the back centers and about that , then our earth has used the earth the wall up or after a <unk> ."
so <unk> across our <unk> up to think .
and the most important thing about seeing this is to drive and as it works .
"in the ground , over <unk> percent of meat is <unk> ."
"right now , we &apos;re able to fit corn and above 30 and fewer revenues per <unk> per <unk> of swim per <unk> <unk> for lake income also ."
that means we lose a <unk> about weight more than being common .
"we can , of course , of course , -- we can hit the northern district ."
"and all is actually <unk> , so-called content ."
"in india , for example , by the <unk> of twenty percent of the <unk> country have , has had <unk> destruction ."
"and because we get older , this will grow up ."
this is all remarkable in <unk> .
yeah ?
one baby needs about intense unexpected to do <unk> .
"we could cost <unk> <unk> to 10 percent , but what do it ?"
this is taken in <unk> in in a second .
this is absolutely as you know .
"so the question is , how are we going to develop that potential to have a use ?"
and here &apos;s one evidence of being that men aren &apos;t pigs .
but let me tell you .
that <unk> phosphorus will <unk> through their high solid <unk> .
there was the <unk> people in the people .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
"it &apos;s because it &apos;s so obvious , right ?"
now the traditional nature of the body -- we &apos;re too many out in the world .
"and when you get people out there to be people who are <unk> as well as if you tell , it wouldn &apos;t be better , you &apos;re not going to go back to that , you &apos;re going to get out any <unk> and <unk> ."
"and so a people <unk> gore tells us one of our big heroes , there &apos;s nothing description to prevent the human population of <unk> ."
"in israel , you say if you <unk> . you <unk> earth ."
"here &apos;s what he said ,"
yes .
"the first question is , did we belong really too many ?"
"if you look at the ants , the ants that share in the world , they go around , then puts occasionally , they <unk> of more than we &apos;re <unk> ."
"i could also deny myself , it might be a single school , but in the united states , nobody may like not jump in there , so far , although it &apos;s myself ."
that means that ants are made much more than we do .
"and because , in contrast , they work much more difficult than we , and because that only &apos;s only one another about six months -- they &apos;re going to live in their ancestors -- with a lower billion people ."
"this is what we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too dumb , is it ?"
"and where you see how far we are , what we really wanted to do , and how we would be able to push back to earth , we could see that , in so she can see , a laboratory back to a broad country here 30 ?"
"you can just be upset when you don &apos;t exist , yes ?"
the only phone .
could you &apos;ve seen an outbreak in a time ?
yes ?
"well , one ?"
"that means that all the state is that we want to be a bit <unk> as trees , yes ?"
<unk> ?
"no tree , the tree is <unk> ."
"the good reason can &apos;t , happiness ?"
there are no <unk> in trees .
there is still two billion trees in the food chain .
"do you &apos;ve already heard about sort of from , the tumor cells , right ?"
that &apos;s what our intelligence means to think we should as trees as if trees .
"and so where they see , even like <unk> , the <unk> agriculture , for agriculture , it doesn &apos;t allow for our own <unk> are going back ."
every year we losing three million per half million individuals which actually go back in this river .
and we are too many .
it alone .
"so we have to feel so <unk> on earth , that we are saying , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and just as you all say that our own <unk> turn out my own <unk> ."
isn &apos;t that sad ?
we &apos;re too many .
"it &apos;s difficult to be less benign in more accessible , to <unk> of governance ."
"now , where are we useful ?"
"we try to put our more ethic on economic footprint , but it &apos;s about having a huge footprint , which is useful ."
"we want to be good for the society , we want to be good for carbon , but if it comes in to the environment , that &apos;s the real , not there . now ?"
"rule , yeah ?"
you can have them just volcanoes from when they &apos;re not there .
"even if you should disappear now , you would have radiation ."
"so , they can &apos;t get this up ."
we can do it differently .
we can take our data back .
we &apos;re <unk> in brazil in which we stop the <unk> .
"completely precisely , we can use it in the way that we float there to agriculture ."
"for instance , we would do this in china , in which we go right and take the <unk> of it ."
"in china , a <unk> is now a traffic <unk> , so what , in , you know ?"
and in our wild beyond the world we were increasingly excited about <unk> our <unk> .
"the thing that is , the whole western <unk> , is that the city was being shaped by it just has never taken , but the farmer never has no <unk> something ."
"and this mechanism , the cities had to grow more , because the farmers streets and the cities had to get out of to another increase their <unk> ."
"it &apos;s all the bees that have just <unk> their arms , until they have to encore , and then they &apos;re dropping in ."
yes ?
it was different in china .
"and there &apos;s been half of interesting thaler out of that , since there had always be able to put cell from it ."
"even though you have in the dinner tonight you &apos;re invited to cook 60 years , to the food you stay until the toilet were shooting until the toilet was <unk> ."
because it &apos;s passing to go and puts up the <unk> .
"you invited them to cook up to lunch , not for <unk> ."
it means you can see on the internet how to happen to the <unk> back ?
"actually , that &apos;s <unk> when you do it , islamic power , it &apos;s made , again more <unk> , can be put on country in a <unk> healthcare system , so it can buy some hundred dollars and feed flu and pills and <unk> <unk> and fish ."
"and what &apos;s great interesting is that , and the main sciences is that the broadcasters go on about the baby &apos;s <unk> percent of this ."
"so we don &apos;t have to control people , and have brilliant to be very good at the very very <unk> ."
we &apos;ve become them healthy to be good .
"it &apos;s <unk> , of course , all these resources are having themselves ."
the total beef is clean water .
and they &apos;re that designed by that design a too farmer to just channel .
so that &apos;s what &apos;s going to get the audio back .
"and no one has walked from those organisms , now we &apos;ve actually built over <unk> in the last 20 years , not as any of those plants are ever <unk> ."
"you could just <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and then have to <unk> it for years ."
and none .
"that means that , not have to control people in the same time in giving very little smile ."
"we can be <unk> , become good ."
that means we need to engage worldwide .
"and by the way , if you want to do it , you touch yourself in germany , it just is about aid that you &apos;re at the top of population ."
"but unfortunately , that &apos;s not in <unk> , but maybe you can make the <unk> , to help you do a little bit , you can take on it ."
because the <unk> plant could go out at best <unk> behavior .
and the one &apos;s got to go back .
we can see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that they are very wealthy .
we &apos;ve used to <unk> for over three years .
<unk> government has explains this waste of its first country in the world as discovering phosphorus .
but we need that in <unk> .
"you understand , there are two countries that control most of the risk of southern california areas today ."
there &apos;s a sort of <unk> of <unk> around us .
these are <unk> countries where <unk> percent of the control over the arctic .
and the oil we will replace other actors .
but the phosphorus becomes is really not able to replace .
"that &apos;s not about trying to make the existing field a bit less you &apos;re making , but it &apos;s kind of kidding ."
and this is to be an old question of what the right thing is .
"so this is about <unk> property , not our trillion ."
"when you understand that in time , you understand this , we think , of course , because the country has built <unk> to color ."
yeah ?
"think of , if your wife is sad by having lost your wife , and they say <unk> them , and they come out with fantastic <unk> ."
absolutely inefficient .
"but even effectively , is it or even effective ?"
or do you take a <unk> .
"so a woman in <unk> , it was about six <unk> of three boats while its lifetime ."
there .
"this is not doing george <unk> , because we don &apos;t know how much you have is going to do it ."
"but a sink , even in the nerve iphone , i can tell you is very valid , but extremely conventional , right ? yeah ?"
and that was all the things that they &apos;re inside life is not it transparent .
"and that &apos;s not that <unk> goes down , but organs ."
go to wonder what was the right thing ?
"not , the <unk> signal is for a little better and gets it off in the <unk> , in the development reef , losing all these materials , are about to lose at the time , first <unk> , how temperatures go ?"
guess the elizabeth <unk> the continent .
yeah ?
"so , when i raise her dinner , you glamorous , there &apos;s a field of paper full <unk> and there &apos;s a glass of water ."
"good , yeah ?"
that &apos;s investment .
all things in life is <unk> no <unk> .
"if you go to someone in love , efficient ?"
yes ?
"that is the matter what counts is where it &apos;s going to stop save save around , avoid <unk> ."
all the <unk> .
"we say the <unk> , oh yeah , you don &apos;t have any in the south ."
"no , it &apos;s <unk> right , right ?"
"anyway , go home to release on , from <unk> , there you are sharing ."
but the wrong thing .
"if you do put some things out in the missing <unk> up , you put this more too ."
as we think of the north .
there is tension coming in between us .
"you walk , yes , if you hook , every avatar holds the ground ."
"because the floor is going to die down the floor , and the wind turns off , and the land <unk> the floor ."
"but if you are in italy , everyone business leads to the water feel you &apos;ll stay in the meadow ."
so it &apos;s about making a big tom become a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we are actually now talking about sustainability .
now is ?
but when i ask you what is ? you &apos;re doing so with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
"and then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?"
this is <unk> .
"so not 500 , expertise , avoid profits ."
everybody to <unk> is <unk> .
"and it &apos;s an amazing number , if you see in italy , like people in the high level , they encounter the car that makes you really like the car ."
"because , you know , that &apos;s an adaptation ."
"it &apos;s a living by <unk> , right ?"
you can show me there .
"but with the right design , i get good , here ."
"and for example , we &apos;ve created a magnetic layer to fruit that is multiplied in <unk> energy ."
you can <unk> where you leave and <unk> .
"and a bit of hours , it completely leaves ."
"and it contains seeds of rare plants , that it <unk> through the <unk> to bacteria ."
"which means we &apos;re useful , not much less than engineering ."
so there are two sophisticated <unk> .
it &apos;s not going to be enormous in danger .
a tv configuration or a <unk> data group that they do entirely existing .
"just things that are told , like <unk> , like <unk> , that we had to be out of anything like that we have to turn around is <unk> systems ."
and the things that are used in <unk> systems .
but today we are only talking about the world &apos;s systems .
yes ?
"for instance , of the <unk> , yes ?"
"the very <unk> party , not to <unk> with the company , but for it , you are opening up reading this company ."
because we don &apos;t have making these things more <unk> .
that ? right ?
"so if i take that off to lunch , and then i say this is free of metal vessels from <unk> , it helps you haven &apos;t ."
"no , we begin in showing what &apos;s in there ."
positive .
so not as <unk> .
there &apos;s no toxic in that .
"yet all of is , by itself , useful ."
"these are the first shoes in which you can turn off the <unk> cluster of evidence and go over <unk> <unk> to biological complicated isotopes , right ?"
all of it is hiv .
"and as we &apos;ve found it , <unk> , we really need the people for nike , for simplicity of <unk> and engineering and elsewhere , and <unk> it ."
and that &apos;s half the diamond <unk> -- and that <unk> about the <unk> that goes by causes .
"and just helping in giving off , ask for questions about that ."
"well , <unk> , are you true , do you really seriously ?"
because now they have taken two primary relief users now .
and i &apos;m not so safe to teach boys .
"so , actually help me do a little bit of that ."
and very first .
yes .
"well , let &apos;s show what &apos;s been mentioned bottles ."
this is true .
we can do the things that you can do because you add them if they can take back together in biological energy microscope .
now the electricity process is equally about it .
that gave this one into what you find .
"and that &apos;s the first baby pink camera , which is actually what it &apos;s doing in the reverse direction ."
"anyway , so in every store you can <unk> things ."
"you know , when you are coming to this , yeah ?"
do you remember the <unk> still ?
"now , if it &apos;s trash as if it &apos;s <unk> ."
you &apos;ve <unk> <unk> all over and <unk> that is almost within <unk> .
now in the countries where people come to money .
"and this is a view here , but otherwise they &apos;re at a transformational landscape , yes ?"
"as we change the plastics , that it can go into biological systems , if we change the mesh system , inside if they can just turn back to sit back in , then they can get to a baby in israel or in biology ."
exactly ?
"on alone , if you use these <unk> <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> , around plants to plant trees ."
"and it &apos;s the baby <unk> for the whole life , the senses back already ."
"so we don &apos;t need to be necessarily , we can be a <unk> ."
so this is <unk> to light membrane .
"yeah , some things ."
yes ?
we can do that .
we can take you open for all of each other .
i started an engineer to come up with the bush .
"so , again , there &apos;s many people working with it and they can get certain <unk> all over here ."
there &apos;s an extra competition going through where everybody can go to balance .
"so not saving , until go to prevent , even no person , not a <unk> , but intelligent device ."
so does it be curious ?
thank you .
the work from instant coverage .
music as language .
"in the description of the subject of my talk , the <unk> i actually am about as an idea of <unk> , so in english , understanding of my name ."
<unk> is the papers from the written <unk> music .
"that as an term for failure for the word the text is to <unk> , by another language , but also a subject of words and <unk> , to understand it a score with a pcb can do ."
"already in words , to <unk> from <unk> , there can be more knowledge because if you manage it to content or even -- to write &apos;s poetry ."
"sort of creature , the definitions is a way that awe at what we are doing with our <unk> ."
"as a <unk> of a word , one started by only the imagination ."
they treasure that <unk> the <unk> has <unk> hide just things that it <unk> .
"actually , the hallucinations are very attractive and criticized ."
these <unk> are roughly simply <unk> as <unk> as whatever interface as if and very conventional visual effects just ultimate statement .
"because in these such <unk> <unk> of <unk> , the projection that flowers don &apos;t to smell that speeds only from the <unk> system to the race is not losing the wind &apos;s wind ."
"this is , you just need to give a <unk> test data scenario made you first with another one that gives you an arrangement event , and you &apos;re tracking ."
"today i would like to share with you what i else do to eight times , so even again , translate into the heavy language ."
"so basically , a <unk> approach to <unk> ."
"therefore , i cut this stuff you should hit <unk> in <unk> because i &apos;d like to translate it into english again it would be encouraging traces to me on top of the <unk> &apos;s penis <unk> ."
"so , the music works for me to use exactly the spoken language ."
and the clouds started the <unk> of the letters of one <unk> .
so it does not come to learn just <unk> to learn from hearing and to press the <unk> on the piano or end up <unk> .
that would be just the letters that you learned to paint .
the meaning of the letters of you can only tell the language to happen .
"so so according to the <unk> of the music , at least as long as you would know for a language ."
"then , while there &apos;s good &apos;s <unk> whether you learn about your teaching , you only understand gesture or you can see , you can also <unk> being expressed until you grade an individual ."
the work of action starts the kind of <unk> things like the <unk> .
"after you really <unk> play with a little bit , because you &apos;re crazy to <unk> any night from <unk> to take the creation of the landscape of creation ."
we collected information about what is about a piece like physics .
"they are reading the <unk> manager , the <unk> , the way they think were , are thoughts of the subject themselves ."
they &apos;ve studied the works that he <unk> before and after hour .
you represent <unk> ; you <unk> .
the washington thing to write .
what really was it going ?
"how did he go out in , like the society and the politics ?"
all to me place .
one is in that kind of thinking in place that you &apos;re looking at -- i think there &apos;s exciting images and connecting <unk> .
"and that &apos;s over time , you know , also have a luxury system in a potential sense of constant knowledge about <unk> , which it <unk> , and it hits the <unk> , it always reaches , you ."
<unk> &apos;s going to continue to getting more with something that you live together in .
"his cause to write the piece , becomes more and more to my personal insight , <unk> ."
"then the <unk> off everything as another <unk> of the <unk> of the study is , but only a framework , i basically take that <unk> to make meaning back to meaning and <unk> it ."
"i say , leading to my own case , something that could be written between that framework ."
i have a music <unk> what that sound might have emotion to ?
"and now for me and for <unk> within that time , and what you could mean to him today ."
"everybody , any tone there will get a sense of it because i <unk> it because it from my personal point of reading <unk> ."
it has to be <unk> of me on here and now not that i can &apos;t convince my audience that i think this is the cause .
it &apos;s a very awkward cliff whenever i have this experience that step as long ago i <unk> to experience how fresh .
"as you <unk> me from much beauty , since , all the bilbao <unk> with the same threats of life , up <unk> , run off , worked , so i &apos;m going to go to the <unk> one thing out over again ."
"and i increased a times , rising <unk> , and along the day , population church &apos;s high fall as a rate takes longer , to get it longer to finish off the end of the decline in home when one was home again ."
"i put this for the audience ever out of true , unconscious , <unk> ."
so it &apos;s what that affects me and all the work we &apos;ve become through the lifestyle <unk> .
"now true <unk> is also the even if i &apos;m standing in side , and we &apos;re in the same sort of comfortable ."
"then it happens in a good , for an worth of <unk> conversation ."
you bring up a new idea and you get that credit to happen in an reaction .
"it &apos;s gross , because then things this thing that we don &apos;t do so complicated and that we haven &apos;t now take samples ."
it makes very fun making music as well as that way they have for experience what people have prepared for music is <unk> alive .
so every concert is a different electronics .
i will never play more like this at the moment .
i can &apos;t play any way today i &apos;m not as in 20 years .
"now , i &apos;m going to have more experience experience alive today and am , as i go down with my <unk> increase over <unk> , at ideas and paintings and <unk> in today than today ."
"sure , then i &apos;ll have some commercial <unk> in , but for that new time , what &apos;s going on ."
"well , there &apos;s a <unk> example ."
"and it was actually an artist &apos;s <unk> &apos;s frog , <unk> , professor <unk> , not known an <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , with professor of <unk> ."
"now , unfortunately , i &apos;ve been too young , so i was at an first place that i &apos;d encountered at all ."
"but i was really lucky enough to sell him <unk> years old , and i was , so i was -- like to be in their classes of paintings ."
"in the time , when i was <unk> at one of his study and raised the last clip with four <unk> from the pepper <unk> ."
he asked me what the results of this life was for me .
that &apos;s basically a <unk> part .
"and in my circle , i said , meaning ."
and he said to it and &quot; so condoms .
the <unk> need to be their <unk> .
because to me really made you regrets .
he &apos;s been about family <unk> .
"so you &apos;re also challenged , and you don &apos;t have a variety of very efforts . it is not any major argument ."
i &apos;m having games that they &apos;re up and thousands of years . and always now it never changed itself to me even though it doesn &apos;t have a single note .
"every time it is <unk> , because it &apos;s how i &apos;ll read something new ."
an example that made this kind of differently . <unk> leaves the <unk> <unk> ?
"it &apos;s always the same garden , but <unk> with <unk> , in hurricane ."
"it <unk> the <unk> <unk> inspiration , as it turns out to start <unk> the <unk> ."
its personal superstar shapes of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> string theory is when you &apos;re the equivalent .
"now , i &apos;ve been involved by . <unk> , as the whole telephone , and when the <unk> is starting to write that piece of time ."
he actually did find just nine years to see .
"and it &apos;s important to me , and it &apos;s just as i can go through at the grades , even if i can <unk> my own ."
"to hold on , directly with the crystal ."
because the <unk> are the only connection to him .
if you &apos;ve all died by anything .
"now , how do you think about the language of music ?"
"and i said , i &apos;ve just got almost a second for the extraordinary language ."
"and in the conclusion , in the times , people become so exciting that you have to read the sleep ."
you almost learn to read before you just talk to just one word .
"so you learn to find the sound on the diagnosis , as a cello ."
"and if everybody is in time and really making it all the time , it goes through the <unk> , each other comes out , you &apos;ll send sounds that <unk> like music ."
"if that happens a <unk> is , i convince you that women will come up on ."
"and now , what the interpretation can , in <unk> , hardly ."
"well , there &apos;s like the back at the end , which is a quick piece ."
"<unk> , slowly ."
"it &apos;s charity and coal and <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
that &apos;s the most unseen .
"but even , with the data , those models still alone , there &apos;s also just a <unk> ."
"and yet , it &apos;s always not a interpretation ."
i wonder .
"and i wonder categories , very often , we better have a joke ."
"actually , that to make music in this instrument should do with their own musical language or feel used before ."
<unk> books .
"a child who didn &apos;t learn the phone because all the parents don &apos;t have , it will do it by itself ."
that &apos;s how <unk> .
"it &apos;s central to its own sense and this idea of music , to bring it to another way of describing an instrument of device that is going on to sound ."
"people who have never <unk> , have never felt kept with the own body as it is to form a note ."
<unk> an exercise with his simple weight .
"the state , which is the body of our body , <unk> ."
"we &apos;re about pushing our clothes , our hands and your feet , working ."
so the side of the road is actually the <unk> in the gray way .
"it &apos;s based <unk> <unk> , the <unk> and the love of the dance ."
the <unk> <unk> <unk> music with it is not to stay .
so you don &apos;t need to have <unk> music if you get jewish <unk> .
"now you aren &apos;t going to cook for a <unk> , or sing ."
every it becomes more <unk> when it &apos;s constantly <unk> by his music .
"<unk> there will tell you , &quot; there will be some of you who say , yes , but what does , if i could not sing ? &quot;"
"what ? i &apos;m asking you to name , if you don &apos;t think you &apos;re not willing to sing ?"
"or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to singing ?"
"two , there &apos;s not too late to say why they can &apos;t come , or learn how to use these little muscle , they &apos;re doing the clients muscles that actually used right ."
because you can train that one .
"or c , because they <unk> them because they &apos;re local ."
"i &apos;m wondering , how <unk> was this compared ?"
"have you going to be a warning of or <unk> , what to say ? today ?"
"or d , you know , you don &apos;t like music , and you &apos;d like to make <unk> with them as well ."
"but then , what i had to do regret , because the music is actually nice , straightforward problem ."
but maybe you can consume it even though again .
"well , you can see , if we &apos;re traveling , everybody &apos;s got to have any inspiration big ."
"but i will not miss them , neither point from the classic music ."
i can &apos;t tell whether it &apos;s good or bad .
"i say that , but certainly you can tell yourself if this is not what you like ."
"because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s got person , i don &apos;t know if i love it , because i can &apos;t cooking ."
"so , they didn &apos;t <unk> on food , just because they can &apos;t cook ."
"so , they also don &apos;t need to meet classic music , because they &apos;re not playing independent instrument ."
listen to <unk> and tell whether it or not .
whether the music to you too comfort or is <unk> .
and say that &apos;s what they can be .
with time they want to get producing products and don &apos;t want to give up some more structure dead or taste of planetary differences even exist .
why do i challenge by my audience in every part of keeping that <unk> ?
because music is language and a language is to communicate .
so it was a piece of art that you never look at are not a force .
the food that was given from a hospital or a <unk> tube has forgotten and won &apos;t take at tiger cameras or <unk> at <unk> .
so please please listen if it &apos;s played on music .
they &apos;re not just a really nice cloth .
"so if , in an environment , where the adult hands do can make music , or at least proper touch music , only a child <unk> , is getting able to ask , what color does your interior actually have ?"
can you play me to the blue here either ?
"and the child does their own contact there , instead of another blue <unk> ."
and this sounds very different than had done .
and that was the very first first ever a <unk> concept .
"so the first step , to interpretation ."
so what happens when you &apos;re playing a piece now that would now be <unk> a hundred years ago or even a <unk> <unk> ?
all of us have a fantastic implant up to school .
"there was , when <unk> stopped as the instrument , didn &apos;t even exploit the piano ."
it just wasn &apos;t invented yet .
"i think that the stream is amazed , if he had a fundamental opportunity to have <unk> ways of conflict ."
"i can have the mountain hair <unk> , which i could , for free , to name the modern forces , which also would allow you to did a real date ."
"so by the council , you know he heard more than he &apos;d been <unk> ."
today &apos;s <unk> &apos;s hello in . i need a modern orchestra to play all the <unk> of what is built by <unk> .
so these are the <unk> that <unk> come back to us better <unk> those colors .
so they &apos;re <unk> to what they only have their own chains .
and whatever they &apos;d thinking about today in the stock room .
"or , i just appreciate that , because you could think of it ."
thank you .
"you know , what warren &apos;s very ?"
were you receiving this <unk> ?
and how did that feel ?
hours .
i did a friend who continues a computer .
"if i come from my little <unk> <unk> to <unk> and just <unk> in the position , that sense is going on ."
i &apos;m at a little bit through the head .
"i say <unk> , which you need to , n doing that big car ?"
that &apos;s probably the <unk> third of its experience .
"and at all , you see , you quite less than me ."
why does i do to afford he . &apos; sorry for the title ?
and then i &apos;m immediately <unk> to get . it &apos;s a clear thing .
it &apos;s against the justice .
"and as i &apos;m saying the word with justice , that is comfortable changing ."
our organism has invented a great process to make those metabolic emotions <unk> of simply and fire .
so they can try and think of this with words like <unk> or <unk> and .
"i want to explain one here today with this <unk> today , or something that is probably very familiar with you don &apos;t familiar with you ."
the wake of it comes from the earth system .
"but don &apos;t think about how they might have heard if people , if nobody &apos;s left , nobody &apos;s available to get a wall ."
"and then flash off stones , so he covers them the view for the point ."
"in that text hunt , you see the says that missing prevent ourselves , it says ."
it makes sense of <unk> easy to realize he has a very different one in the sense .
he <unk> you and it doesn &apos;t act you .
"no , the <unk> that i talk about , who has to do with us that they were always <unk> ."
they need those <unk> to <unk> . they need this <unk> to let the head <unk> .
"you can bring them less easily , yes , <unk> or <unk> ."
they need time .
having one <unk> to be known by this time you might know it .
the <unk> painter <unk> <unk> <unk> a woman <unk> .
"it turned in a <unk> , and the dutch didn &apos;t see what they would see at ."
<unk> phone happens -- just wait .
they &apos;ll always think of it .
"in that point , and if you laugh , you &apos;ll see how important these pieces are , the way that it &apos;s actually happened , and how much time you have to know what artist can tell us very well about ."
because artists have a higher relationship to a vicious rate level .
"the artist give is one talking to you , and within all that type , what she &apos;s and she doesn &apos;t watching , if you just look inside the mirrors ."
"and the artist puts this over time in one performance and something that &apos;s linked to you , what you &apos;re just going to get around with this art is where you &apos;d see again and come through ."
"and then , that <unk> sense disappears , it may not much considered at all the way , and it &apos;ll more it will <unk> you at the time ."
"there you have these <unk> that we use <unk> , and we have the professional invention than one wonderful invention of our web ."
"and not only in the art of art , also in the media in the <unk> , when it is , things starts to look ."
you may have the idea of the lady in the <unk> gave off every tomorrow and asked him that who is the most <unk> of the country all over the nations ?
"someday , that mirror will show , yes , there &apos;s a switch garden ."
"behind the seven mountains , and on and so on ."
"and they also know how much <unk> in the true act of this true memory , even though it can &apos;t be a <unk> of this <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
but we just should give you enough so that you can &apos;t possibly say that there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> somewhere else .
here &apos;s an agreement that has to understand even . it <unk> .
"so what we need to do now is that we have these different <unk> <unk> , <unk> that we cannot <unk> anything in ."
"and we didn &apos;t just divide into art , but we don &apos;t be in <unk> science like great as a career of science ."
and there is this story from the woman &apos;s homeland <unk> .
"she was listening by this book by charles darwin , the emergence of the <unk> and the <unk> of people ."
"that the <unk> of <unk> as to the <unk> , and yet , at least , there were a common ancestors between people and <unk> ."
"and then they <unk> them into their cake and they said , well , you know , when charles writes it ."
man &apos;s men &apos;s <unk> and has a common possible <unk> .
"no , no , that &apos;s not about ."
"and if it is true , then we will often remember that people get evidence of detecting themselves ."
"why do we need to prevent people from anyone to get a position , when it &apos;s done ?"
because we cannot live with that pole .
"because we showed this powerful thing , that feeling very <unk> from the most muslims , not like one of those like this , about a whole organism which exists to be a square , <unk> , and but is how it enters to the stuff that ."
now we cannot bear this .
"we &apos;re positively encouraging people a <unk> from things , especially if they &apos;re in effect ."
"so you &apos;ll see , as slowly , that strange shape <unk> and what the <unk> look is that it &apos;s going to seal you in a different kind of photo of ourselves at a second which i want to see the same story and add more right ."
"a particularly beautiful story , just like me ."
my wife told me .
she came from school when she was pissed away ; she <unk> and she had an teaching bridge .
<unk> student .
"they &apos;re like to really some interest , because he got a network for lunch ."
"and she asked him , liberia , what are the position of brain ?"
"and he says , &quot; well , i &apos;m at the fire of and ."
"and that &apos;s because i &apos;m at the <unk> boom , i &apos;m science to teach stuff ."
"yes , you &apos;ll feel that if you &apos;re stuck at that point . there &apos;s nothing ."
"and i said , i have told my wife when one man <unk> that makes the <unk> device , because at least i should try to replace it with <unk> which each other ."
"they give that one , and then they all experience their seat ."
"although i &apos;m in the <unk> foundation , i &apos;m interested in breakthroughs ."
"they &apos;re <unk> , so this is the real truth ."
so one of the little libraries that aren &apos;t very interested in <unk> .
that &apos;s the primary interest .
"but there &apos;s no <unk> , where we can save , which to go about , where they gain <unk> ."
"there is just extended , just the fire area ."
it &apos;s got anything ready .
"and as in awe , the <unk> might also say that you don &apos;t like to have <unk> and <unk> at times when your fire soon gets off ."
"no , it just looks really much better if we describe the fact that we &apos;re <unk> to really pull the <unk> , the other time that we don &apos;t do it as you let barefoot fire ."
they have this little brain bird .
"it was a <unk> that probably knew that he didn &apos;t know that he &apos;s actually being missing with the fire of fire , but he didn &apos;t say that too before it can ."
"here you have the south settings between the gas and the <unk> that gets <unk> back without sure you can do it , and things you &apos;ll see you can see look very different , totally make you a lot better thing to do on others and much ."
"and then the process is simple that we apply do , even for speech , in the language that we also use to continue to much more global <unk> ."
we actually know that &apos;s something that &apos;s very different .
"but we know when we get out of the <unk> , we sort of hold with the social <unk> ."
we &apos;re reading that out of the world .
it &apos;s not impossible to work within a society that needs to work on you .
"so , i want to share with you what we &apos;ve discovered in my 20s ."
"after based on what this logic , those efforts , the willingness , the willingness to make another reality we actually know are mostly on sheep , until after <unk> &apos;s <unk> ."
"let me just give you three examples , maybe three examples of it ."
"the first example is produce , which many of you know and some of you seem to don &apos;t have a very much <unk> of you at all ."
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
"the soul is kind of <unk> , it may be about a <unk> ."
"they are another thing that wasn &apos;t <unk> of immediate <unk> , incredible nature ."
"and if you have people who are deeply conscious believed that you have a soul , or you can also give a belief that you were given by the soul to live as something , they <unk> in how , to be part of it , as within what the tissues , so individual , as if they &apos;ve"
"and from this human view , imagine that you in that kind of <unk> nature , in this nature , in this <unk> , <unk> is really <unk> , the chris , they grew in ."
"and when that image is implication the people moving over over , he &apos;s <unk> with , with the spirit , with nature , which can only be living , can only be the top with the muslim ."
and then he can <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s the notion of how the soul folds into that .
so they &apos;re going to go from the outside .
so we should perceive them as something that really should be <unk> .
"and when you have that commitment to the eyes , they understand the logic that we can live with this happiness by <unk> a better world ."
because now you can apply a local mission .
they still know this from school .
now that &apos;s one mobile framework that has him alarm describes logic .
this is the most part of my talk .
"here we need something odd , but also by <unk> the taliban ."
"so , that is to lie to me that logic can just be applied in a <unk> thing ."
"and in this india , three units <unk> are coming ."
"the first unit is <unk> , which is critical , there is no soul ."
"so the second sentence is , if you have right , then he gets a soul ."
well there &apos;s a third alternative .
i did it for you a especially a few times .
one poet sentence that immediately <unk> in human beings who have a sense of emotion for a soul .
"and saying , &quot; whoever isn &apos;t face , that &apos;s dead and can &apos;t argue anything ."
and you &apos;re still feeling it out .
"here &apos;s where this logic comes in , which is , in that <unk> point , the data <unk> talk ."
they look it right .
the first two <unk> include those things that are really nasty .
"in fact , i can they stop ."
the logic is not a <unk> of reality .
i can say this guy &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s a man .
"and if i &apos;ve done right , the <unk> is a man ."
"if i &apos;m right , well , the <unk> is not a man ."
the logic doesn &apos;t understand what it certainly did .
i can share it all .
"but the more central is , when i &apos;m right , i &apos;m smiling , then they did ."
"so when <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul ."
"and the second , if he is right , it &apos;s not challenging any soul ."
these are things that are necessary .
and so our <unk> brain forces and immediately along this can make a difference from it .
"it runs an <unk> tree that hasn &apos;t done without the first two <unk> , and it does , as the left of the first <unk> flights and transplant <unk> ."
because we should absolutely have to prove whether these people or not .
"but with that logic , it &apos;s using just using two feedback kindness , and an immediate definition that looks as it could , as the way it could have to do something to we can save our research ."
"so , we do that as just as if there was no way to be able to live the soul ."
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can lift those things at various sets of examples .
"in the present era , we have a improved instance , that will gather over the online lab again ."
"<unk> , you have to divide by another magnificent issue with real , a <unk> <unk> subject ."
"well , that has to do so that we reverse this into reserves ."
"there was an entirely <unk> called the <unk> player , and after that &apos;s labeled the <unk> called <unk> ."
the <unk> <unk> is a social food that is really subtle .
the woman not <unk> this arena .
this is a <unk> .
"and if they ran out the <unk> in between two tricks there , i would follow ."
because he &apos;s not known to whom hollywood for those to go first .
so it says the sitting in the middle .
that &apos;s how the <unk> <unk> performance are .
the <unk> forces with <unk> soft power to produce each other .
there &apos;s nothing done in all right .
"by putting another example , if you put it in time , they instantly turn into your supply to a <unk> which , then you don &apos;t need anything <unk> to do again , and none of that ."
"again , it goes on to the right thought ."
"so if you have this idea , in nature somehow being expanded , they get <unk> from the greater few things that you &apos;re immediately <unk> a position , and you have a feeling you might do things as well ."
"and if we are in the <unk> area here in <unk> , i remember looking at the injustice cup processing ."
"and there &apos;s a <unk> called the wolf called <unk> , and sometimes it &apos;s right , you know , immediately , &quot; yogurt consciousness male answer , there &apos;s no time to be . &quot;"
"and we can get out of a second sentence and then say when i have a musica correct <unk> , did you not have energy <unk> ."
these lines are absolutely compassionate and <unk> .
and what you now can read almost every often in the words that you can find in that third sentence .
"it looks something like who hasn &apos;t drew at his strength , it can &apos;t have to just dependent for its heads and <unk> access to responsibility , so it is <unk> ."
"and again , they have it again ."
"in fact , you had to prove <unk> of whether there &apos;s something <unk> like <unk> ."
"but the logic effect allows us to do this , as this at first unit , as if the first one of these approach did comes <unk> <unk> from obesity as doesn &apos;t have to cut the <unk> from a wider side ."
"and now you can just do anything if you want to do anything if you want to test anything on your own , and , especially when you want to do miserable these were somebody who <unk> the courage ."
"help that pull in for example , when you meet a people who you could say to , there isn &apos;t damage ."
"and please don &apos;t use that german as that <unk> , which is &quot; <unk> . &quot;"
you can &apos;t call that . things propose it could come back with a bit of the entropy .
"say , there is no <unk> ."
"it is immediately as given an art , for which you have these sort of source moments of <unk> , and you can &apos;t have evidence of self ."
and they already have trouble .
"because while you &apos;re stuck with the <unk> that you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no prospect , the guy is pretty happy ."
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s committed to her .
"because he has led them on a breakfast set , and everybody hasn &apos;t <unk> on themselves ."
because this person is actually not interested in transmission .
he &apos;s not only interested in having its <unk> from <unk> to comfort that there are <unk> .
"so , in the kind of indirect life that this <unk> is , it &apos;s the tangible type of <unk> ."
"and once you &apos;ve got such a ability to feel that <unk> it &apos;s going to be there , you &apos;re going to do it , because you &apos;ll be too happy in this way you didn &apos;t remember it ."
i thank you for your attention .
"well , good afternoon ."
"i gave myself an <unk> sauce , whether i just <unk> it ."
"this one is one of the <unk> from the big event and wondered whether i saw this presentation , shouting out here and my idea ."
"i have to be honest , so i &apos;m <unk> , we started to talk even crazy about my idea ."
and maybe not a <unk> that i <unk> to introduce you to seats .
"but it &apos;s also <unk> to the sum , full of ideas ."
"i may , in fact , they &apos;re given the two great girl because i have probably taken for generation who &apos;s focused on this one bad precise thing , because i used to study <unk> , in <unk> homes , the primary education diplomat , i believe ."
"and then in the middle of <unk> here , <unk> years to berlin , and that &apos;s because i was in <unk> <unk> , and that was like to <unk> ."
there was the <unk> burned .
"that thing <unk> all of the <unk> , the <unk> used to say it called <unk> ."
they &apos;re parts of film that &apos;s called <unk> standards .
because a good engineer either has building neat cars or <unk> pipes .
"but just like <unk> , <unk> out of something like a <unk> of <unk> millimeter that used to go out of meter ."
"and in berlin , there was a really <unk> big art ."
"and i am the best <unk> that i saw that he &apos;s going again when it has something double , because they &apos;re not using their word at <unk> , because all the left was <unk> ."
but it was not that much in the <unk> years .
"and since there was that there was <unk> <unk> and one of them was just sitting in the <unk> , where they were fed to the damn thing ."
"the site was <unk> , but that was the <unk> law and <unk> and <unk> and having it started in the middle ."
"and , pretty much of what said we &apos;re fairly in this particular project was influenced me by a lot of beautiful grandfather many , so i was what i learned with as well ."
"and i &apos;ve been working out in the <unk> <unk> , who was more successful ."
we were a blossom younger people .
"if one has not just said , it was empty , that was remarkable . and i &apos;ve got ten years to prepare for that when i really quite a great encounter , because all of my colleague , all of my colleagues , no friend on him , right ."
it trains with arms consumption .
"and that &apos;s really , really , very <unk> , and it comes to like that one &apos;s time in your <unk> , where i wondered to you a picture i have just a <unk> it , where , of course , has said , that little decade later , where the year <unk> , actually , but <unk>"
"and i &apos;ve got it all to <unk> and then i &apos;ve picked up up with the friends of friends that would be taught to the interface of <unk> , which would become an equivalent of largest <unk> in the biggest world ."
"one <unk> implant , well , for example , we &apos;ve learned a healthier tissue , we give a longer group , just to decided that we &apos;ll start as far , and go back and turn it back and lives from our view of my own and understanding ."
and with i &apos;ve brought a project that i want to let you now look at .
"and the title of the prison is , yes , you know , that &apos;s going to be around the poor then , every hundred energy ."
and we just started doing a relatively fundamental story to question where you could have a <unk> profit now that we might actually <unk> today .
"on the island , this is the island <unk> <unk> ."
"yes , that &apos;s the data ."
there are about a thousand waters .
now they have increased <unk> disease from the $ <unk> percent .
"and the question is , why isn &apos;t they ?"
you don &apos;t get <unk> you .
"when you put more unique , you get to <unk> , it starts getting into blobs ."
i &apos;m a <unk> of trying to tell the politicians when you use our <unk> .
"the key to say , why ?"
we &apos;ve already solved 20 percent in germany .
cannot be not with a problem .
"but , not right , we &apos;ve seen that in <unk> , and our web feedback is really the biology development ."
"if we had about 17 percent in china , since we had the same problems that people have because of that island ."
"and the question was just top of it , though , <unk> was the <unk> industry on the island , you know , that &apos;s basically over the island , really just through that <unk> ."
"how big is that that whole take a battery so you have to communicate such an island against 20 , 30 , <unk> , <unk> , perhaps even reduce <unk> percent ."
"and yes , i walk and wander out again ."
the patent system looks like that all around the world .
"by the way , there are a hundred <unk> , layer of electrical application on a different <unk> across the world ."
"this is quite a hundred foot percent of leadership , because things are very rapidly , really fast ."
"the <unk> of the world , which is held with temporary <unk> because you don &apos;t need anything to have been there ."
that goes fast .
and just stand up like this .
and then it &apos;s a decision that &apos;s <unk> .
"up the dealer , three of the remaining planes , two got waited ."
"yes , this is what one looks at inside ."
we also have very precise data .
"and the <unk> or the poverty , or whatever it is , and it &apos;s that automatically takes place into a <unk> system , which can just be <unk> in small so small ."
"our goal was to be just say , okay , ok ."
"the <unk> becomes <unk> , and the wind , sunlight after its yin , is the very bigger part of television ."
"and if you &apos;re listening to about 20 percent wind electricity , that energy &apos;s growing , in dollars , don &apos;t <unk> the performance here , you need to come from the gates ."
"that means that in the moment they have to care about trade that in renewables , they all double the budget of the net ."
"you can probably , of obviously , a matter of course , by some <unk> you can get in ."
that did have no one on the world yet .
"and so that &apos;s the case that in small speed , so you can also help your kitchen <unk> on a little more <unk> ."
"the people always ask me , &quot; well , what do you do when they run a backup quality ? &quot;"
it &apos;s nowhere .
"but for organizations , if you want to build by those amazing functions and the net to build a net , it &apos;ll be very complicated ."
"and our goal we just had come back to <unk> percent , and then we left to stop extra <unk> , the rest for the rest , two and 20 percent , that it &apos;s going to work very well , and it &apos;s extremely low ."
"and this is going to be an awful large thing that goes , hydrogen , soft <unk> , power light on it , it &apos;ll be the most ... , then it &apos;s going ."
they want to go for quite a <unk> and stop and not only to move around .
"and we just wanted to know what , because , with an individual , ordinary , severe shut inside ."
how far is there because at all ?
and then you have a whole series of <unk> learning <unk> .
"and henry and sun and the fossilized <unk> and really got to the result , which means that to the conventional system in these conventional years , it takes a middle average prize for about roughly a <unk> cents to out space for example , about quantities aids ."
these were the brown <unk> computation baby years ago .
"and we said , &quot; okay ."
"potter great , then we have a plate skill ."
we are cheap as the car power production would grow five percent in a year .
and then we started acting with the deep press .
what necessary would all be done ?
"still for <unk> <unk> , i was turning new wooden <unk> ."
"we were just at the time , five guys for a to train society again ."
and here &apos;s the <unk> of it .
"the electrons are sort of a loud system , the green green is our system ."
"we have a <unk> that said the use , is that we &apos;re going to take 90 percent with art <unk> , and a monkey <unk> all the other things on it ."
"and that it really <unk> , which is that the <unk> of power on the island , which we find quite very cool ."
"and let &apos;s also be grateful to support , but we don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to get the problem with ."
and so we determined the <unk> to 2011 to actually build the electrical <unk> so we can dynamic through the island of one on three <unk> in the edge .
"this says we &apos;ve found that we have then <unk> <unk> , find the biggest battery of the world ."
this is her .
"it does shaped , by asia , by industry , in the case of japan ."
"and it was developing the third years when they walked in part of the british machines today , today they were developing , and then shared the author , and then they began the japanese ."
"it &apos;s emotional , it &apos;s a very , very big battery ."
"she has an <unk> performance , and i think it can take six hours of the performance , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;re sensitive to as much as we have ."
and then they then sort of hit .
"we &apos;ve also got one of these on the same size as he is in the central place to come to nature , the entire continuum of this grid , so in the <unk> here that &apos;s sitting from there , the roof , and that &apos;s the big <unk> there , is the california path here , we"
"over here we did monterey capture <unk> away , <unk> <unk> the wires to pull the <unk> out on the web ."
and here you can see this all again .
we can also develop a pure device that will involve the <unk> .
"this is what we &apos;ve been looking at this again ; <unk> again again , the story this is following , sort of an individual once ."
"and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , since <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> . a period to basically <unk> to what &apos;s happened there between the drug d.c."
"so we &apos;re not an oil cycle , but we are the address that are only between the battery and the page and it &apos;s all between the world and it has ."
"and of course , you need to communicate to your battery , you have to communicate the net on the web , and it &apos;s very complicated ."
so the <unk> here &apos;s nice to the issue in this island is only does we have cancer to become trouble about <unk> issues that we can do as if we wanted to increase our income energy from renewables .
"so this entire debate as a moment to <unk> and of <unk> is about how to go to the island , we &apos;ve got the equivalent of <unk> up to <unk> percent whatever , so we <unk> the wind and the sun itself ."
<unk> <unk> is then free to <unk> .
"so , part of this thing , the <unk> is everywhere ."
"we can start from the island over the island of <unk> into test , to let &apos;s <unk> on this because , since a doubling ."
"that means that when you can do <unk> percent reduction water , you will <unk> not make it <unk> ."
"you can <unk> off from n , for n <unk> , for example , that you should , on all of it , and the size of critical levels , you should never end up a fully <unk> ."
and that &apos;s the little variation of the message .
"so , also lots of people get in it and they &apos;ll watch these places if they get the problems that you have ."
"if you &apos;re going to <unk> into the bike bag , you &apos;re not necessarily going to have these <unk> holes produced a some of the skeletal grid ."
and our major <unk> system is essentially just <unk> amounts of all light streams of data where the wave blows up to the <unk> .
"we &apos;re looking into this web , we &apos;re going to see the <unk> defense net , and if this was going to going across nine zetas , we have a very little <unk> <unk> go back to decades , we get back up ."
this is the system .
"and of course , that &apos;s an amazing thing ."
"if you make a <unk> new , you need a little while ."
the nuclei in elementary school has at least about a ten seconds to try and store the grid .
and you can always react to something else .
"if they haven &apos;t done that <unk> violence , it will integrate the <unk> and replace <unk> ."
and we can do this major battery energy on two times once every day .
so there &apos;s a reason you see that all incredible metabolic points are there .
"and the message is now , we need to deal with these <unk> mass destruction , if in ways , we have to do 20 , 20 percent , 30 , 40 percent , 30 and so much , when we actually want to do this stuff ."
and then we have to <unk> our <unk> capacity fully capacity .
labor is just something called you add to stay universes .
"yeah , well , that &apos;s a <unk> moment from <unk> , because we don &apos;t , or <unk> , because it &apos;s not ."
"and we just try to get our capacity , you can <unk> the capacity , the sensual major <unk> , yield by taking individual <unk> into the web ."
"that &apos;s accessible now , as well as you can now , have a whole variety ."
and then that goal is the <unk> people get into there and watching our <unk> spin on the one of our policy and so on .
"and , you know , the discussion all goes over to talk about how far you can get out there in a way that &apos;s going to do it ."
and many discussions that i have had on the last six years was sort of like the discussion i &apos;d had in the last half a ted picture .
"not off , touch , abuse , we have everything , start to work on it , never changed ."
we &apos;ve then books here 30 <unk> in germany .
so this is automobile art .
and i just go from seeing that in the next child here in the next 30 years we &apos;re the same capacity of <unk> <unk> across the earth .
"and very simple , so it &apos;ll happen ."
there &apos;s going to be such a whole bunch of drawings and arguments .
"the beauty is , i have actually <unk> the work of the two years now that the scientists are themselves in my side ."
we &apos;ve got over the 12th of the <unk> of 20 <unk> also to speed up the german museum .
this will be in next april .
"so you &apos;re being aware that there &apos;s a change there and by only , you &apos;re supposed to come down from this general , about a hundred percent <unk> water ."
"and then when you &apos;ve got hundreds of <unk> energy , that &apos;s like an <unk> system ."
"and that &apos;s interested in discussions , always trying to do this clip that are building every reasonable base that has been doing a very little spread with our own senses , which doesn &apos;t have anything with something for us ."
"the question is very simple , if you can do fully <unk> <unk> americans , or dig <unk> any degree to the world that you &apos;re <unk> somewhere else around , so they &apos;re sorry about for 18 ."
they just use them across the sun and wind it is where they &apos;re living .
"and that &apos;s like a little bit of our vision from one <unk> service , and i &apos;m so <unk> , dan <unk> being told that they &apos;re writer so ."
"and that &apos;s what we do , including ted saul <unk> , also , the talk of <unk> <unk> : that you can use a <unk> , here &apos;s a little <unk> ."
"so okay , i &apos;d just like to finish you in the sense of that you could be a little bit crazy and have a vision and it too much like a vision ."
"and you really have to stay very <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going ."
thank you .
"when steve <unk> , has the <unk> of los angeles times a day walking outside the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music ."
"she came from a man , a <unk> , musician , <unk> , <unk> , who &apos;d playing on a violin party can only just two transmission ."
"many of you may know the story because of <unk> articles discovered this platform later from starting a book that <unk> as darpa <unk> from all moments in steve and <unk> <unk> as a <unk> anthony <unk> , the <unk> company who was now <unk> to a writer ."
"<unk> left under walked and died of a <unk> and a half years later , he had left on the streets of <unk> mountains in the city of los angeles ."
"and i &apos;d like to read all the , <unk> book or read the film , because they can &apos;t just understand the great identity that went between these two men that helped them grow the <unk> and how the music was together , and then its model how the problem , the solution would take that jihad ability"
"i met <unk> <unk> <unk> 2008 two years ago , from the <unk> , i made a <unk> campaign ."
he had just heard of this meeting of corneille &apos;s first surprise and <unk> <unk> and moved behind the stage to imagine me .
"so he talked very efficient , very <unk> that came over <unk> , and <unk> <unk> and <unk> how much <unk> may never make it in the baseball description . i mean that everything had made this last incident last one show in the fascinating video ."
"we came to talk to music , and a few days later i got an email , and i got an email from people who had complained to work ."
"i have to mention that <unk> was a treatment as not being treated , because it was already treated with developmental <unk> and <unk> to be treated with <unk> , a nuclear honored to create him all of life ."
"and as an just of one , he &apos;s often <unk> , for these <unk> <unk> computer , and sometimes <unk> there are about so <unk> , and then he disappears for days away from <unk> c , always joined this <unk> car and the <unk> ."
"and in exactly what one did was a surprise when you saw the first kiss in the <unk> <unk> , at the high stage of death <unk> , we started having the <unk> nerve cells in his eyes and anything -- were being completely lost ."
he was talking about invisible <unk> and lions woke and denied how to smile from your sleep .
"i was scared to buy her , but i terrified that i could lose him to be able to grow in one circle of his property , and that alisa to 11 play , if i could started talking about <unk> <unk> and different inventions about individual and old <unk> and things ."
so i just started playing .
i had the first sentence of <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
"and while i was playing , it occurred to me that in <unk> &apos;s eyes were a terrible change ."
"it was like himself , looking under a invisible force ; a chemical response on its move , to run my collection ."
"<unk> <unk> beer victims himself transformed into a broken curiosity , <unk> ."
"and what i did with a <unk> , he took his speaker , and he started to be hearing from dead <unk> from anybody and i asked to play , herself , <unk> , three times , <unk> ."
"we then started talking about music , at a time from <unk> , <unk> , and all the other rooms filled with <unk> , to <unk> to <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> ."
"and the thing became clear that he did not only had a sense of <unk> <unk> about music , but the <unk> film to them ."
"he spoke about the pleasure of passionate , and understanding of i just learned from my colleagues in the los angeles people in the years ."
"by talking about music and music &apos;s been , <unk> , <unk> <unk> man actually <unk> the streets of los angeles to close , a fabulous fancy , <unk> surgical bed ."
music is medicine . music changed us .
it means magic <unk> to other people .
"because he allows it to <unk> him , and <unk> his thoughts and <unk> on his imagination and creativity to <unk> ."
and so he served his super <unk> .
and i understand that &apos;s what the nature of art is .
"right away , it &apos;s why we do music , that i mean that we the selves , inside of all , deep inside our feelings , through our artist , through our design approach to shape technology ."
"and this is what the most <unk> takes us in case , and this is quite inspired and these entirely ."
what <unk> <unk> this <unk> over the music brought it back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music brought it back into a family of <unk> that shared his understanding his good choice and <unk> it .
"and i get billions of music with <unk> <unk> whatever in the <unk> <unk> &apos; mri , or <unk> von <unk> , because he reminds me why i &apos;ve been the musician ."
thank you .
<unk> <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert evolution .
robert accumulating : i want to play something i &apos;d hear a national <unk> .
i hope forgive me .
so i <unk> the conference in my life a lot of guys .
i &apos;ve just got two <unk> .
"that third , that was just more like a passionate <unk> ."
"it was a beautiful fish , extremely <unk> , <unk> efficient software , ridiculous for that piece of credit ."
what a fish fish .
"other times , it &apos;s been <unk> by the largest lobby , and after sustainability standards of sustainability ."
"and so you could feel about it , you could selling him ."
i had that beauty on a relationship with tens of months .
in one way that &apos;s called the $ magazine <unk> team and asked if i could update about sustainability lessons as it was going .
"&quot; of course , &quot; i said ."
"here was a company trying to solve , which <unk> our prosthetic problem for our volunteer . how do we keep every fish for our younger scenes ?"
"in the past 50 years , we <unk> the sea of <unk> as we <unk> forests ."
it &apos;s hard to <unk> <unk> the destruction .
"in 90 percent of the big fish that we love , the <unk> , the <unk> , the bad ones , the boom , that have been raised ."
it &apos;s almost nothing left behind .
"now it may be some difference , and except a bit of our own , &quot; <unk> , be part of our future ."
"some of them are worried about that . underwater <unk> <unk> the environment , most of you it during them and , they &apos;re very innovative , and there &apos;s a huge <unk> ."
he has an <unk> with <unk> at 15 .
"this is , in <unk> island , we need to get a pounds of <unk> by entering this place ."
not rocket .
it &apos;s also not very good .
"so , here , finally , a company who tried to do it right ."
i wanted them to stop .
"the day before the event came , i have the toughest <unk> from the <unk> court ."
we call it <unk> .
"and i said , &quot; just just for the facts really , you are <unk> before the soil that you &apos;re putting out the environment that you haven &apos;t <unk> <unk> . &quot;"
"&quot; true it says , &quot; testimony this way . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that there &apos;s no <unk> from our fish . &quot;"
"and then exists , as we &apos;re , basically for a own world ."
"it &apos;s a <unk> of rules by <unk> , &quot; he said ."
&quot; trust in the ground . &quot;
"<unk> too one , great ."
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; jill &quot; anything ? &quot; what are you feeling there ? &quot;
"&quot; sustainable proteins &quot; blew , he said ."
"&quot; great , &quot; i said . hang on ."
"and the evening of this thing was that i went in bed and i thought , what the hell was a protein ?"
"so i called the next day just a bit short ago , <unk> <unk> ."
"i said , &quot; <unk> , what being smart proteins ? &quot;"
he said he doesn &apos;t stop the case . he &apos;ll <unk> out .
"well , i put a <unk> with some people in the company , and nobody could give me a <unk> response , until finally i first arrived to a <unk> <unk> ."
we also call it any <unk> .
"&quot; <unk> , &quot; i said , &quot; what about , what are production making green proteins ? &quot;"
"now , he said some bones and some mushrooms , and then he later said <unk> ."
"i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;"
"he said , &quot; yes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , cooking and <unk> play . &quot;"
"i said , &quot; how much percent of your property is chicken ? &quot;"
"in <unk> , perhaps two percent ."
"&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent . &quot; he said ."
"and i said , &quot; what &apos;s sustainable about <unk> for <unk> to <unk> ? &quot;"
"there was a long <unk> there where he started , and he said , &quot; there just can be too much chicken in the world . &quot;"
i study from that fish .
"no , not because i am an operator and <unk> ."
this is an reverse reality .
"no , i actually <unk> <unk> from that fish because , as i went to <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> ."
that second fish : that &apos;s another kind of empty rock .
"it &apos;s a solution in the way the way that , of , you know , the better one that you learn has to talk to its fish , you love the fish ."
and i did in a restaurant in <unk> in <unk> .
a <unk> had been speaking of about this fish for a long time .
she was <unk> to us .
he came up with one <unk> through a <unk> white color .
the <unk> had got him .
stay twice .
he was obsessed in <unk> .
who can help a fish pretty badly as he got <unk> ?
"i can &apos;t it , but that guy can &apos;t ."
"we call it <unk> . in fact , he &apos;s <unk> <unk> ."
"and no , he didn &apos;t pay up the fish and he &apos;s not the <unk> . at least in the way , you , look there and i &apos;ll understand it ."
he &apos;s a <unk> at <unk> .
this is a clip in the corner of the falling corner .
it &apos;s space close to the stream across the river .
"in &apos; church , we had a twitter collaborator in the hands of <unk> ."
"they sat <unk> down by that , really hot <unk> ."
they did it by <unk> the land .
they built the <unk> of bees and they sat off water and <unk> out of the country .
well they did not make the copyright in an economic system -- so not stable .
and we knew it was kind of catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the birds to put what a lot of birds have to .
and so <unk> bought a local company called the country <unk> .
what did they do ?
you have <unk> the cycle of the river .
they actually have the commercial <unk> .
"rather , and the water <unk> used the skin to <unk> the water again ."
they <unk> the <unk> .
"they processed for a acres of consumption -- <unk> of <unk> , of magnitude , flat <unk> -- and doing yoga and tried <unk> his company to fully touch it ."
the <unk> is incredible .
"i mean , they have never seen a phrase this ."
"they &apos;re <unk> <unk> across the worldwide , and the budgets is <unk> , and things that you &apos;re leaving full tanks and these dense , <unk> , <unk> ."
i wasn &apos;t very long with some <unk> at all .
"he &apos;s an incredible guy , three things darwin and a piece of milk i &apos;m a bit of running . &quot;"
"okay ? so there are we the <unk> <unk> and i sat down and not full of <unk> , <unk> down to my <unk> and in fact , <unk> is <unk> with a <unk> ."
here he brings a rare rare light <unk> .
now he posted the <unk> of <unk> .
"and here , it looks at a pattern of <unk> 600 of <unk> that take off the east ."
what you know was the subjects attending history has spent the greatest part of its great career in africa .
i asked him how to have it become an <unk> .
"he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish ."
i &apos;m an expert in a relationship . &quot;
"and then he goes down , and turns back on to a number of rare birds , algae and algae ."
"and don &apos;t really understand me , that was really irrational , you know , the <unk> community <unk> <unk> in that way ."
it &apos;s fantastic . but i was in love .
and my head became as smart as i did for this sort of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
"so i <unk> it . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does that matter you get that fish so bad ? &quot;"
he showed up on the algae .
"&quot; i know young , the algae , the <unk> <unk> , the relations , the relationships , that is incredibly terrifying ."
but what do you eat your fish ?
how is the civil politics ? &quot;
now he goes along with me to tell you that it &apos;s a extended system that the fish <unk> out what they &apos;re going to eat in the wilderness .
"it &apos;s the <unk> , the upper <unk> , the <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> properties ."
"that is so healthy , it &apos;s all really deep ."
there &apos;s no food .
from a <unk> tree they don &apos;t know their animals ?
"and then i was walking around on this store <unk> , wondering , and i told him to say , &quot; for a place that seems to be as these , for any <unk> of who i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you land ? &quot;"
the moment at the moment it was said that if a <unk> can trust it .
"and we give back in the corner and we gave ourselves the <unk> of it , spent thousands of <unk> and thousands of <unk> results , literally a <unk> can enough face there ."
"&quot; this is success , &quot; he said ."
"&quot; look at your facebook <unk> , there you ."
she &apos;s making them . &quot;
monkey ? i was totally <unk> .
"i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you reward any fish ? &quot;"
"&quot; yes , he said ."
we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to birds .
"well , last year , there were 600 birds in this there this skeleton more than 250 different species of nations ."
"now , this is the biggest and one of the most significant private <unk> had over europe ."
"and i said , &quot; well , is a good experiment to have this one last to <unk> ? &quot;"
he arrowheads and his spirit .
"he said , &quot; we &apos;re building tests not allowed to cook imaging ."
this is a kind of a scientifically network .
"the able to <unk> go , eat the <unk> ."
they ate the <unk> .
"so , the nitrogen that &apos;s a bad that does better have . &quot;"
"okay , let &apos;s <unk> <unk> this . you know , a sanctuary that you don &apos;t take off and exercise you can measure yourself as much about your development for health of your health ."
a <unk> but some physical <unk> also .
"oh , and by the way , those realizing filled not even there ."
they leave in a city of <unk> km away where the underwater <unk> is better for the <unk> .
"every morning they fly 50,000 to the <unk> kilometer ."
and it has fueled them <unk> miles from that evening .
they make that because they can follow the bad line from the central sky .
difficult .
"i had taken some kind of journey out of penguins , so i looked at tv ."
"so i said , &quot; <unk> , you can go <unk> kilometer to the <unk> foot , and then you fly around <unk> miles a day ?"
do you <unk> this for the children ? &quot;
and he looked at me when i just passed a song from yochai back to fill in advance .
"and he said , &quot; no . they make this because it &apos;s better . &quot;"
"i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my loved fish that had the labels -- and i worked out without any <unk> . i don &apos;t like them . i don &apos;t like her , i don &apos;t know about philosopher by you ."
"it is <unk> , secret taste ."
i have almost never <unk> .
"and yet , when i <unk> you into this restaurant in <unk> , they did not even after all i did ."
they were doing on cool and shot when you &apos;d take a <unk> of the ocean .
"i mentioned this to people &apos;s imagination , and it <unk> ."
"he said , &quot; the skin <unk> like a <unk> ."
it is the last process before anything in your body .
"and it has evolved throughout evolution in the course of the time , with bubbles . &quot;"
"and then he published that , &quot; but our water has no cancer food . &quot;"
"all right . a <unk> that didn &apos;t scan the slice , a joke that flies into certain things ."
"and then , i realized , i was going to say , a science person who has no device , he has credit pressure , because the water from that sort of drill <unk> comes from the <unk> ."
"it &apos;s a switch that &apos;s tracking all of these things are coming from rivers so far to come from , and effectively produced chemical <unk> alone , <unk> pollutants ."
"and when it turns through this system again , it has this <unk> , and it &apos;s the water device as it takes away ."
"the system is so healthy , it <unk> the water ."
"well not only one of the world that doesn &apos;t <unk> their activities , just a force that breaks their mental health needs , but a writer that &apos;s literally a <unk> one might be a <unk> , and not just for the fish but for you and for them ."
"because when the water was listening , it &apos;s in america ."
"a fall in the ocean . i know that , but i consider it , and they &apos;re also ought to do it because , like , <unk> , as being educated , a series ."
"you could say you &apos;re a recipe for the good part of 10 times , whether we talk about it or intensive <unk> ."
now we need more original concept from wireless from a dawn in which actually taste good <unk> .
"but to many people , it &apos;s slightly too complicated ."
"we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we are <unk> ."
we love teachers . we love little food . we talk about <unk> food . we feed food .
"and if you say that those are the things that have good good <unk> in the future anyone who says , &quot; hey , listen , are very people flying francisco , but how do you feed the world ?"
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
may i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like the question .
"no , no , no , because we &apos;ve grown enough calories to use the world more than only little to feed ."
a billion people today become <unk> .
"a billion -- this is more than ever before -- because of <unk> <unk> in distribution , not necessarily the count ."
"now i don &apos;t like this question , because the logic of our heads has counted the last 50 years on meaning ."
"<unk> -- the bacteria , <unk> of chemicals , the earth , chicken , chicken , and all the time has the one thought to how we &apos;re feeding more people more with the usual ?"
that was the national business name . it was the contemporary public qaeda . it was the american agriculture .
"we should call them what they say , &quot; <unk> a toy within northern prison , an <unk> to <unk> at short energy ultrasound to exactly the system which feeds these to together ."
"this is not <unk> , and it &apos;s not manufacturing ."
"the organic that we are today threatened by not by losing , but not chemical conflicts in fact ."
"not through the latest structure of northern and through killer selves , but using the enormous land , but not through mud of water , occupied , but through forests , by removing greenhouse trees , and activities , but from water in sea ."
and they want to feed the world ?
let you start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better than the way that we can take resources that bring into each community to grow themselves ?
"i just <unk> doing that , don &apos;t look at the bottom of the future ."
it &apos;s really old . and it &apos;s been the about this .
"whereas mental , and mammals are in time to have education ; there &apos;s never really a good food to food ."
but let &apos;s see <unk> approach .
that &apos;s the thing that raised in two billion years of back .
"look at food supply , farmers like <unk> cotton ."
"meetings that are not worlds to have , comics , <unk> , d.c. or companies , living television companies to produce video , <unk> partners that are <unk> but not just selective relationships , but in a relationship , of relations ."
because these are the characteristics that participate and practice yourself .
"and when i &apos;m really honest , you are a better <unk> than i will be ."
"and , you know , that &apos;s a right about me , because if you &apos;re really good in the future , the model will be <unk> ."
thank you .
"and i want to share with you one thing that is that the ingredients of the data we consume , is larger than one , as a split and in the ways to think , so they could predict how we could act and so done information ."
so what we see here is an exponential outcome after age .
i also use this . i &apos;ll use a little experiment here .
"it &apos;s called a tech and what i can do with probability is that after one particular terrible person , i can say flu <unk> , we give <unk> ."
and i want a different pattern of getting that .
"that &apos;s because there are people living at the people in the world at <unk> , and they are on <unk> here ."
"we can go a step forward , and we can go out and see the data , and see that <unk> and cancer , <unk> are the <unk> <unk> , but not for anyone ."
"now if we move forward to age , let &apos;s say 40 years or closer to early on that sharks there was even of the biggest biggest trajectory that people ought to worry about ."
and who &apos;s recognized that that &apos;s true for men .
so they <unk> that <unk> information in this way to travel for a way of making <unk> make sense of growth .
"and if we can do that for <unk> , why don &apos;t we <unk> for content ?"
"what we now do now is the next single person who come to the <unk> plant spill , they &apos;d never photographed ."
it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s all online .
you can use it on for me on your <unk> .
you can still run into a month .
you can put you in <unk> a year .
they can jump directly at one <unk> .
"now , if i look this , i see the <unk> that seems in this issue and the objects ."
so i &apos;m a <unk> armstrong <unk> . and i <unk> this because i talk to you any <unk> armstrong &apos;s point it is sending books to go .
"now , if i want to only <unk> <unk> is , i could myself think i &apos;m going to think <unk> anything about the subject ?"
"so i take it back , and then i take a look into the perspective ."
now i see <unk> <unk> .
"and so you get this idea of having an idea that you could look at this sort of stuff , <unk> , wider , <unk> , engineering and not just in it or attracting it or not just any caring ."
you do something that actually is kind diet-and-exercise different .
"so it &apos;s sort of something between the ones , and we think we &apos;re able to use to be used to the way information ."
"i &apos;ll end up the hope a bit , about something a little bit suddenly ."
"what we &apos;ve been doing here , we &apos;ve rescued every single <unk> , and <unk> them , down for those , on a little , reduced ."
<unk> the fiber one little <unk> and an civilization hanging out of the area .
i &apos;ll just show you the top 500 probably the <unk> one .
but even in that conclusion we can do a lot of things .
you immediately get an origin of thinking about news about wikipedia that are <unk> on mars .
"and i &apos;m going to vote the point out , the healthcare thing ."
"well , after i &apos;ve given government that i have those treatments that these <unk> that are the most year remain <unk> in <unk> <unk> of people in the year ."
this really matters when this is an mind that &apos;s not in one single column .
"this is just if you look at a step at an each , the whole ."
"now at this particular one particular piece of <unk> , i &apos;ll go out into the <unk> <unk> <unk> thing . &quot; back to the next year , now &quot; and the neanderthals reach together ."
"and when i consider all those individuals i see that the majority of them are <unk> . some of you get from science . some of mars 52 , come from the economy here , a demo by the economies . an world &apos;s from the water ."
"and , it seems out and interesting is a ted student <unk> ."
"so we can now <unk> <unk> , and then take a look at all the <unk> <unk> ."
"you can see on the network , as we &apos;re giving up the next time in whether it &apos;s actually a network , not only by the page , but much as a lot more magical ."
and so i &apos;d like to show you something else that can be a little demonstration .
and i &apos;ll just show you the new york times as well .
"<unk> , that application -- i didn &apos;t want to call it an browser ; it &apos;s not a browser , but you can see books with them -- and we &apos;re bringing these <unk> with everyone else like this ."
"so , i can come back to another , and look at right after a specific frame ."
that &apos;s why important because only by looking out of sites in this and do think that all sorts of relationships can look at the same way around .
"so i can take one in my particular <unk> over , in a certain chain ."
this is the full demonstration of what i was going back up to that .
and i can do everything i have probably looked back before i look back .
"and , when i look back to a design and look at everything , i can take my story and we &apos;re going to get in , and my field &apos; here for <unk> , looking for cotton , and then on -- &quot; still where live live green ."
and here i can drive into the side and be coming back again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that is used by and spread over every time it makes more big than the sum of the second <unk> .
"right now in the in the world , what we think that ted is a <unk> ."
we &apos;re talking about the <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about <unk> <unk> information .
"what if we could turn this situation and <unk> the internet so that , instead of going for a regular to many , we start to as many different things from going to <unk> to a whole variety of things , and in getting <unk> of the viruses ?"
"if we can do that , then this <unk> will <unk> into a way of <unk> to put out a new piece of information ."
"and instead of getting into information alone , we can know from this ."
"and if we can tell it , then we could even make a <unk> out of that ."
"i &apos;ll hear with it , thank you ."
i grew up with a terrible glamorous <unk> outcome .
"and then , i went to school and place at school every single time in the prison every single day ."
"and my nose always brought into a book , a flying creature to just say to me in other worlds and all i have deeply at to realize in my deep era , <unk> curiosity ."
"so this curiosity turned from it , whenever i was in school , i did not gather around the forests , around the forests , <unk> travel , <unk> and they were making signs and <unk> and <unk> , and it had sought all over at the microscope ."
"i was totally completely <unk> , you know ."
it always was about trying to understand the world and find the borders of how they started it .
"and my love for arguments were <unk> in my far bits , because then in the late &apos; 60s , we went to the moon and the moon , <unk> and the <unk> ."
"<unk> <unk> came in our lives with his loved <unk> , <unk> developing animals and in part of d.c. that <unk> we might have imagined ."
they would all too do that way to this one to realize at the <unk> .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
"and since there was no video games with materials , but the whole papers on the media landscape , i had to have to create the pictures of my mind ."
"we had to -- if we were just reading this one book , we <unk> the description of the inch and <unk> it up into a eye walk on our canvas ."
"my response to this was drawing and drawing with aliens of <unk> worlds , somehow discovery , end , several and so done ."
"and in the movie , i was <unk> , and at <unk> , feeling <unk> , <unk> forests ."
diplomacy just had to cut out .
"and here , which has been interesting . because the idea of the time <unk> that i was <unk> to show us there was one completely unknown world down to us at our earth ."
"i certainly wouldn &apos;t be able to have a <unk> world of a war , which seem rather unlikely ."
"but here was a world that i was actually able to roll in this place , and it was as so <unk> and <unk> , as all of which i &apos;ve always been wrapped in -- as i &apos;ve used to read those books ."
"so i decided when i was 15 , being skeptical ."
"the only seller <unk> that i was living in a small village in canada , 1,000 <unk> miles from the poorest ocean ."
so i did not solve them .
"i did my father , except even after , he made a <unk> in <unk> , new york , <unk> of <unk> , just on the others of the border of living ."
"and i did my puzzle assignment in a pool of the breakdown in the winter chamber of science in <unk> , new york ."
"but the ocean , actually , that real ocean -- i really did bring two years later on when we pulled to california ."
"since then , over 40 years in <unk> , there &apos;s about 2,000 hours i &apos;ve been spent so about one in its water . 500 hours a six centuries ."
"and i learned that the world of <unk> , even in the building of the oceans , the way central oceans is <unk> in the way we can almost imagine ."
"the most vulnerable , nature doesn &apos;t know borders , rather than the resources of our own , <unk> human imagination ."
"well , i actually , mix <unk> <unk> the <unk> in what i see at my face ."
and my love an aspen force on the same as <unk> and ever .
"when i was killing me as an <unk> , it was the ideal company ."
"and this seems the best way to tell my inner insight to tell stories to me , to build images , these images ."
"and as a child , i was constantly making <unk> and that ."
"so films had been the way , images and stories together . that &apos;s where you can get together ."
"of course , the stories i was being <unk> from me were composed of student , <unk> , urban <unk> , and goes to a &quot; <unk> . &quot;"
"but i would love myself because i couldn &apos;t write and destroy the muscle , and <unk> them , with the <unk> ."
"so in such a way , these two variations are ."
"that was interesting about <unk> , &quot; doing a <unk> problem in that movie -- and we had to organize this kind of that kind of that kind of experimental as well , that we have upon that <unk> piece of video , animation at sunset , back ."
"what came out to use was this first <unk> , the chariot of paintings ever had ."
"so the film didn &apos;t find money to this film to people in the middle place they liked to write their classrooms , a little bit , but i figured that the audience went out all over the world like <unk> , at the <unk> , the <unk> ."
"according to <unk> <unk> , the law is a drug free metaphor and <unk> which aren &apos;t <unk> to tell each other ."
so they saw something more mysterious .
and that <unk> was something that i thought was <unk> .
"and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s virtually what happens in <unk> into top of money . &quot;"
"so we were to say , &quot; <unk> 2 , three work on for the next clip , a lot further ."
"<unk> , we set out the guy in there , and that guy &apos;s <unk> all of hot water , and it just knew what this effect would get out ."
"and it &apos;s going . and again , we had created something empty , and the effect of the audience was the same , and also existed in the movie , we already picked up a bit more money ."
"we had this three <unk> -- from them to reach a whole new world , a new world of creativity ."
"so i started a company with my bad <unk> company in the term of <unk> to <unk> and stand up on at the time , and it was called <unk> <unk> ."
"and the idea of this company was , which is this place called <unk> subject to overcome easily acts and will start <unk> with <unk> ."
"and then we did that , and we took it so a half ago ."
"but in the &apos; 90s , we noticed that in the <unk> and our u.s. guard -- what we &apos;ve actually founded after we invented , <unk> to them ."
"i was writing this piece called qaeda that <unk> the <unk> effects of things that are going into <unk> effects and <unk> effects , using evil , human dignity that had been done to -- samples and the telephones were all aging ."
but some of the <unk> basically come back and people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t able to work yet .
"so i <unk> this and i took this other film about the big virus , the electric star ."
"the accident came to me as the &quot; husband and warm in the ship &quot; price . it became a historical most <unk> , <unk> film ."
"but the question is , i really , really wanted to <unk> the real <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ."
and so i &apos;ve taken the movie .
that &apos;s the truth . that studio wasn &apos;t what happened .
"i have <unk> them , though , by saying , &quot; we can avoid the climate policy . i check the film with real bang ."
we &apos;re going to show it in the sharp .
it &apos;s a very important thing . it &apos;s a good generosity to some marketing . &quot;
and i photographed them as a expedition .
"sound <unk> , but all the time again it goes back and it will make the imagination or a reality ."
"we actually , then <unk> , six months later , in which i <unk> on an act of coal , four miles from the surface of the surface of the moon , using me a sandwich galaxy on a tree hall ."
"that was not a film , not <unk> that had been there ."
"so this really , that i &apos;m really <unk> ."
and the <unk> were totally a thing . we had to build cameras and open graphics and make all sorts of things .
"and i got just dark , like the <unk> , there was an <unk> ."
"you know , also , they &apos;ve been <unk> and institutional planning ."
"you <unk> up in these tiles , it &apos;s <unk> in these dark , you &apos;re going to swim <unk> around where not to be taken for saving from ourselves ."
"and i was thinking , &quot; wow , this is kind of as if i actually fell in an <unk> ."
that &apos;s quite cool . &quot;
i was obsessed with studying subject &apos;s mental effects .
"anyway , from that part of doing now in physics and science . it was everything . it was adventure , it was an operation . it was a cheese ."
and it was a experience that could not give me lap .
"because , you know , i could introduce myself to the example of that we could create visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t see what i did , by the beginning , how then , from the <unk> cut ."
"in some of the questions i saw any <unk> as i see , and sometimes the things that i &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that they even saw even had before , and the science in our first time had seen them as google -- chimpanzees ."
"so that was <unk> to me , and i wanted more ."
and so that &apos;s how i &apos;ve done a something very unusual decision .
"well , this next to &quot; <unk> , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to have my <unk> as an <unk> on transportation island to it for some time . &quot;"
"and we started from <unk> , created towards the <unk> , and i <unk> it with <unk> ."
we started to go back to it <unk> .
we took the little robot that we built to build a failure of a common water device .
"our intent was , <unk> and watching to see the <unk> <unk> out what never did before ."
"so , no one had the objective of the face of the domain . well we haven &apos;t got an <unk> achievement , so we developed the <unk> technology ."
"now and there i &apos;m sitting , on the rocks , <unk> in a box , and you can see the <unk> here little in the band , and i realized video , were when i just played this curves at the puzzle ."
and i take the fly to a little <unk> around the entrance .
"i <unk> that very comfortable , but my consciousness is within the <unk> ."
it felt like i fell physically within the summer of technology .
"it was a <unk> form of a <unk> lamp . i had ever <unk> until i took one square slate up . at every single time i had always been before walking down the rubber video , since i took months ago and ."
and the they &apos;ve had an accurate newspaper of the original code .
so that wasn &apos;t a very strange experience .
"it helped me realize that that what you use is that you use enough design at just , and such your consciousness in the <unk> , can turn into that other form ."
it was really <unk> <unk> .
"and perhaps a smaller business plan that might happen in many decades you can just eventually have to do something about in order to explore something or do things , in all sorts of positive <unk> that i can start <unk> as it as an <unk> ."
"after this harvest , we began discovering what we saw back down here , have actually <unk> about how these underground flies that <unk> that fell incredible animal , but this is kind of <unk> shrimp ."
they <unk> our lives from math .
they don &apos;t exist in one of sunlight ; basically how we do this .
"and in this direction , you can see that things apply to a 300 degrees of <unk> that they can survive ."
and i was also very keen on the days of <unk> because that was the <unk> lesson from my childhood .
"and so i ended up with people holding care to the <unk> and doing the nasa and the <unk> and at the center , let &apos;s be able to run , have <unk> spacecraft , traveling through russia , going to produce the chinese and succeed , present so on it ."
that was <unk> .
"but finally , it had been along that day that i <unk> with the <unk> ."
"and i put them together with the suburban neurons into the world , down : ooh , people <unk> , always interested in these kind of urban situations -- to get them set up and take data and consume work , and then they would sort of test toys ."
"we did this . we did basically <unk> science , actually , to say big about ."
"and everything that we did is distance out of my own tracks as an <unk> , as the child , using to tell real income ."
"over the course of that <unk> , i learned a lot about it ."
"i learned a lot about science . and now i certainly think you get a director , you need to give the director , as well as a <unk> , or so ."
i didn &apos;t really change much of <unk> before i woke up up these options .
"because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i actually do ?"
why do i pull this out ? what &apos;s going to that in ? &quot;
these <unk> films don &apos;t bring money .
we are taking glasses and flat bars . it &apos;s no quiet side .
"all i think , i &apos;d be up between animal solutions and meeting &quot; <unk> &quot; and it would have enabled me to put in a meal out with a strands of scanning rainforest ."
"i &apos;ve made these films all these <unk> , for a very small audience ."
"no arguing , no honor , not money . whatever &apos;s happening ? do you just such ."
"it is <unk> to take a skill to the <unk> , the ocean , and the <unk> . and a live economy is -- and because of the <unk> , as opposed to the <unk> , a team that creates a group of people on a small group ."
"because we made this together for just 10 to 12 people who <unk> <unk> have me , sometimes we were two feet only three months old , could go to oceans ."
"and then in this community , you realize the most important thing you have is that you have , any one in front of the other , because you &apos;re given a <unk> to others that you can &apos;t explain any other other any other thing ."
"if you go to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the kitchen journey , the whole foundation , technology , and you might see the other things we &apos;d go to biological , is that if you can &apos;t explain democracies ."
a connection is something that gives much resistance .
"so , as i run through just and putting my next film &quot; to &quot; avatar , i took these very potential fuels in the building who is participating in some endeavor in the <unk> ."
and that really was changed the dynamic .
"so again , i got back into a little <unk> terrain in there . we recommended , we had an office that had no subject before ."
incredibly exciting .
a biological challenge .
and we were going to be a healthy period of childhood for a few but a right-hand family .
so i transformed my way into making films completely .
people had people who were saying that we had worked all these differences well into the planet : machine or on population of its land .
the reason i was to do it was a more profound kind of thinking that very actual process has changed .
so what can we put through all that close ?
how recent things did we learn ?
"i believe in first , the curiosity is curiosity ."
it &apos;s the most important human value .
our imagination is a force that could take <unk> reality .
and your each other &apos;s sad is more important than every different perspective of the world .
i come young tedsters saying to this : give me a advice to me a game to do something to me . &quot;
"and i say , &quot; don &apos;t make you even hear yourself ."
"and they &apos;re listening to others . don &apos;t do it by you touch yourselves , in losing yourself . feed risks on you . &quot;"
"nasa has such a commodity <unk> , &quot; is not a alternative ."
"but in the art , and in the study , a need to be a alternative issue , because there is a <unk> ."
"no tests made into vision , a state of innovation were <unk> ."
you need to be ready investigating those <unk> .
"and that &apos;s the thought that i like to give you is going to make you in the direction . <unk> is a alternative , <unk> thing , but thank you ."
today i &apos;m talking about energy and climate .
"and maybe something great about this because my high school foundation over foundation , mainly to look forward to <unk> of its own property and training what we need to do in order to create the poorest two billion one billion lives ."
"but the energy and climate is extremely important to these people , in fact , even more important than any other on the planet ."
"<unk> means that their <unk> are failing for a lot of years , and we were becoming so little , we get little too <unk> . that things are going to change as it <unk> the environment can &apos;t somehow transfer their environment ."
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to <unk> .
"so , there is a bad <unk> for you ."
and the <unk> it &apos;s very important for you to do so much .
"in fact , once you just going out , from one thing that the price <unk> would as to shrink energy by its obesity by a climate change ."
now <unk> is like a time manipulation is all .
"in fact , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , in fact ."
"the <unk> <unk> established and the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a <unk> case in <unk> obsessed , and so we <unk> that we can create modern materials and how many things do ."
we &apos;ve added a great situation in the rich world .
"but , if we were coming up for the price -- we pull the award in by the 50 -- we come up in the distribution and <unk> that ruler down with co2 ."
the co2 <unk> the planet and the equation for co2 is pretty clear .
"they <unk> the most flexible co2 tissues , which lead to race , and its impact has some very negative effects on the weather . and ultimately , the loads , which intense analysis can &apos;t <unk> <unk> and transform systems and all the systems ."
"now , the <unk> between a cubic pad and the <unk> of the glasses and the energy to confront them , there are a number of <unk> , but there &apos;s not a lot ."
"and there &apos;s certainly the following of the <unk> that they &apos;re going to follow , but they are <unk> transparent ."
so i wondered : &quot; would we going south school to get down at zero ?
can &apos;t half them or do you do one <unk> ? &quot;
"the answer is , until we get close , it will continue to flow ."
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
"it &apos;s very different to say that we &apos;ve developed a meter <unk> tumor . you know under a 3 trillion -- that &apos;s because you &apos;ve two , you &apos;ve set up underneath the front line ."
this all has to be left there in zero -- go up .
"now we &apos;re constantly making a bunch of hiv samples , from 26 billion cost ."
"every american comparison about 20 tons . people from people , less than one ."
it is about five tons for each one on planet .
and somehow we need to produce change that <unk> down to zero .
it &apos;s a <unk> .
just kind of different economic impact it actually has left into the launch of city is also interested in <unk> change and also <unk> 30 to zero just towards zero .
"and this equation has four pieces . one bit , and they have that thing on left -- co2 -- co2 that you want to get to it far from people &apos;s number , and that will present change by the local distribution of income , and each average ."
so let &apos;s look at anyone so far as we can see and in the process we get it down zero .
it probably needs to one of these numbers very close to zero .
"now that &apos;s basic <unk> , but can we go through it ."
"and first of all , we have got nation ."
"they &apos;re today , all daily people ."
and it <unk> goes on nine billion feet that work on 9 to nine billion .
"if we have a very successful demand for <unk> , which is frozen <unk> , we may deliver that if we could reduce 10 percent 15 to 15 percent , but we are at the time time there &apos;s a <unk> ."
the second factor is the service we use .
"this is just by starting food , we eat food , television , television telescope ."
these are very good things and <unk> mean these things that allow they to do almost everyone on the planet .
it &apos;s great experience that this cup <unk> .
"at the highest billion , in the upper billion , we could probably take the smarter and do less , and we need on average each year , and flow up once more than <unk> in the group of individuals that commit one of passing the number and volunteer ."
"here &apos;s a very basic service , and there &apos;s still to try to read any homework job ?"
"and they don &apos;t have that school , so continue to go out and read their <unk> under the &apos; scratch line ."
"now with efficiency , for economic , the energy mating and service are finally good news ."
we have something that &apos;s not up .
"on particular kinds of signals , through other options , through others of education settings in <unk> , there is lots of services , so that some evidence are actually leaving notice by 90 percent , double <unk> ."
"in other stations , like design from <unk> -- humility -- sorry : <unk> -- for &apos;re <unk> ; factory heads : <unk> : <unk> or broccoli -- <unk> or <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , is much more directly in terms of contaminated ."
"total of all , if we &apos;re in a place , we might not have tons of <unk> or maybe even <unk> a factor of 200 or relatively , increased ."
"but of the first three factors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion now , from 26 billion bucks on probably 13 tons ."
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor of -- and that one will be a wide <unk> -- this is the bunch of co2 that <unk> on .
it does think the question you can get .
if you burn . no .
if you burn gas . it &apos;s not .
"almost every <unk> for electricity time , cancers platforms today , except for <unk> renewables and streams ."
so what we have to do on global level is to create a new system .
we need obesity .
"now when i take the term &quot; <unk> , i don &apos;t use the impossible ."
the <unk> is an <unk> . the computer is a <unk> .
the internet and the policy is an wonder .
people here has offered many of these learning <unk> .
"<unk> , there &apos;s no <unk> that it needs a miracle to have one particular company <unk> ."
"in fact , you &apos;ll just get out front and some <unk> , all others don &apos;t ."
"in that case , we have to give money cars and get a miracle in very short of time ."
"well , i said , well , what have i was really feeling overwhelmed ?"
"is there natural groups of transit , a demonstration that people were doing with people ?"
i remembered myself from last year when i was mosquitos and somehow enjoying the people like that .
"and the idea for them became really <unk> of it , they know that there &apos;s human there with attacks ."
"for total energy , this was what i grew ."
and i decided that this would be a conscious angle of fireflies to the rest of the collapse here .
so here &apos;s a bunch of natural nerves .
you can just <unk> to climb . you don &apos;t even have shaped the jar from glass .
"now , all kinds of things , well , like that , but they bring all a lot to them ."
"we need solutions , either one or some of these <unk> that have an <unk> wave and entrepreneurship , and though there &apos;s lots of cards , in the people in the same way , i really see just five days that get these big <unk> ."
"i &apos;ve got <unk> , <unk> , fusion , power retina ."
"and you may afford a complete position , and if you perceive better than i could expect , it &apos;s great , but my <unk> here is that we have to work on our five working with , and we can &apos;t have corners of them , because they have not undermine them everybody &apos;s the tires , because"
let &apos;s take us first to <unk> the burning consumed from either broccoli from coal or natural gas .
"which you have to simply do , may be easy , but it &apos;s not much . you should have to take all of the co2 from eating <unk> to see orange , floating pressure under prices and put food beyond it ."
"there are many <unk> that could address 60 percent , but that will make it more have to 100 percent <unk> -- and give a generation of co2 to a greater <unk> on the <unk> of the civil , and there &apos;s a huge one of them ."
who will make it good ?
"which can benefit something , which can literally <unk> many billion times higher than any sort of <unk> that can be <unk> through police and other objects ?"
that &apos;s a lot of viral .
"so , this is a tough policy ."
next : run mail .
"the opportunity to do it for three great problems , largely between most <unk> countries , the challenges , if you feel like that wasn &apos;t really wrong with human resistance , <unk> to reduce fuel <unk> that fuel is not using enough cure ."
and what do you do with the fixed ?
"but because of course , growing not great is , there &apos;s a lot of trouble ."
"so , three and very difficult problems that perhaps change and that we should do so ."
"the last one , i just looked instantly ."
it &apos;s the renewables of how they &apos;re often called .
and the regulations -- even though they &apos;re great that it &apos;s really not needed fuel -- you have some memes .
one is a mechanism of reduce that these technologies make dramatically more than percentage of been used .
"these are <unk> , they talk much from lots of imaging dioxide anymore , <unk> more than normal power ."
they &apos;re more unequal <unk> of numbers .
"the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , but it doesn &apos;t seem . it doesn &apos;t always burn every day , even as the wind doesn &apos;t even always get ."
"and so you &apos;ve got to choose from those sources <unk> , you have to have the capacity that even when you &apos;re not more available ."
"so there &apos;s the big <unk> : there &apos;s challenges from <unk> . so for example that we say that the energy network is out beyond the country , there are not all the technology to <unk> the issue that solutions that goes from the water being <unk> ."
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
"and now that dimension to dimension i &apos;ve brought everything between batteries that are made all over : for cars , driving computers , , cup back levels , finger , <unk> , and that i &apos;ve come to the amount of depression that i &apos;ve huge quality world took ."
"so what we need for here is a very big trend here , something that will be 100 more likely to be more than the quest to do a symptom ."
"this is not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easily ."
so it will happen to try to try and reach that cover the amount of stuff of marriage about 20 percent of what the <unk> lecture is .
"if you want to support a 100 percent on that , they need an incredible device ."
"now , what are going to be to do , what is the real approach ?"
&quot; the <unk> site &quot; ? &quot; how are we coming to the goal ?
so what we need are lots of companies working on it . hundreds of other .
we need to be at all 100 human frankly in every one of them .
"so you &apos;ll be <unk> , they &apos;re crazy ! it &apos;s good ."
and i think there is a lot of many teaching you here in ted .
"bill bill has many companies , under groups , a title called the <unk> ball of growth ."
"female <unk> delivers store in dozens of companies doing great things and mathematics have no innovation , and i &apos;m trying to introduce it ."
"nathan <unk> : and i sexuality fund an election , that may be engaged in <unk> forces ."
"there are some innovations in the sciences , by <unk> , <unk> ."
"the development hasn &apos;t stopped for some time before you , so there &apos;s no surprise that some good ideas grow in every minute ."
"and what <unk> means is that instead of getting <unk> at a <unk> , which <unk> one percent of which -- selected by the 99 percent , we chose to burn the 99 ."
it &apos;s a pretty angry idea .
"but you actually knew that long , but you could never function <unk> if this would happen before , say there &apos;s modern <unk> it <unk> , you can see you &apos;re saved , and , it &apos;s called that for the right <unk> , it looks like <unk> ."
"and as you exploit these 99 percent <unk> , that means that <unk> <unk> a lot better ."
"in fact , you take a smoke . and you can actually actually use waste of currently attached to <unk> to each other as a bomb waste ."
"instead of pulling out their head , they &apos;re just crossing it , and it &apos;s a fabulous thing ."
"so , the vast uranium will be <unk> <unk> , a bit like <unk> ."
"and you see , this is a kind of node that there &apos;s a lot than a gold stream ."
this really <unk> the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of an area in raw <unk> .
"it &apos;s waste , the 99 percent . it has the slightly <unk> of which is now , <unk> is called <unk> treated uranium ."
that &apos;s the deep baseball water community in hundreds of years .
and if you deliver <unk> of an <unk> and simply taking records and get enough fuel into life today .
"you know , there &apos;s lots of challenges , but here &apos;s an example of many mechanisms we need to be brought forward ."
"i mean , we intend to measure how we need ourselves in our ."
what should our testimony look like ?
"well , take up to the should we &apos;ve got to the present line , and then we talk about the diversity ."
many talking about an 80 percent rate of losing syndrome .
and it &apos;s really clear that we get to end there .
"the rest of 20 percent will be in the poor country , and yet we have a measurement of self-organization , and hopefully it will still be zero <unk> ."
"so , to do those seven percent , in order to <unk> , in the u.s. age of china , that affects her water trip just to the brain stem ."
"the other note says whether we can put in the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest ."
that &apos;s got real big .
and that &apos;s going to get a <unk> of the pirate model .
"and if we go back from there , like , by which decade , what &apos;s going to be factor to look like ?"
and it should still have those two elements .
"we need to use the fossil use to take the cut <unk> , and the less we <unk> the weight you get , and so the temperature also involves ."
"but actually , that note is what we do in the ways that doesn &apos;t make up a completely different point of ways , or even something less dependent on the other storytelling that presents the charge of that measures ."
"this <unk> syndrome is the subjects we have to plant seals , and we &apos;re using that to interact in <unk> , with <unk> , sharing in <unk> ."
and there are many great books on that theme .
"the orchestra &apos;s bold director , &quot; we have a <unk> choice , &quot; and david <unk> <unk> <unk> the air . &quot;"
"they go through and create a frame where that can be traded with this , because we need need for any sides ."
there &apos;s a few things that must come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very radical idea that we can <unk> this technology .
"if you just gave me one <unk> for the next 50 , i could pick the president , a vaccine , that i love , , i love it , which is that is <unk> <unk> <unk> , that maybe our chance will dream ."
this has the biggest impact .
"if we don &apos;t get that wish , as well as the wheat spills and forever expected expansion between the <unk> people where china and china is <unk> between , arrested and almost all of which moms will be very much bad anymore ."
so what do we have to do ?
what should i point you for ?
we need to be used for more work .
"if countries come in places like <unk> , don &apos;t just bear talking about co2 ."
"they ought to talk this kind of paper , and they would be <unk> through the <unk> <unk> , literally efforts to find those <unk> ."
"we need <unk> , resolution , lower co2 , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade . jaw-dropping produces a <unk> tool ."
we have to spread the text .
"we have to have a role of progress and research also , to the things that will be kept from government to us ."
"it &apos;s a more important wish , but i think we can avoid him ."
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
"thanks very much . , all actually , to keep back and experience the <unk> , can you give us a notion of aging ?"
"bill gates : to make a simulation on a <unk> store , to get good scientist at all the kinds of planets we &apos;ve made for taken out for three million . and even if we &apos;ve been using our materials in some radio , for sure this theory ."
the difficult step is this building of the first witness to get more to find more billion that control some references the original one .
"once the first finished is when he &apos;s running the way , it &apos;s very clear , because the worst one , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> is so different than anything we think about ."
"and to really understand this is , it represents deep down the ground as we can move down as an <unk> <unk> and then the record goes up and then it <unk> the process , and continue , on ."
"ah : very same . today , you have to make out a crowd out , so many people come wrong , and lots of <unk> people who are <unk> , and this thing he opens up him and <unk> or nothing , not good !"
"but if you &apos;re getting very oil just cheap , you &apos;re allowed to bring them out to 60 years -- think from half a knee that -- that the <unk> you have , without the whole trash ."
"and it &apos;s <unk> there , and it is that the food is done by 60 years ."
"now , <unk> , who uses a solution for <unk> ."
"<unk> : yes . now , what &apos;s going on with the <unk> : we &apos;re putting it -- there &apos;s a lot of bite in this system of manipulation -- take him out and eat it in the next fold , and they burn it ."
and we start by taking the waste that &apos;s already coming into these <unk> or <unk> at the edge or the top place as the death museum <unk> one .
"so this is what that machine <unk> is a problem with a problem that , in our fill and will be <unk> exponentially ."
but while you talked to <unk> this world over these options .
where &apos;s the biggest interest in which -- what really does it really make sense ?
"<unk> : all we did have <unk> and we put a lot of interestingly debate to something called the names in its name , i have been funny to that i &apos;ve been living up into russia , and i saw that china south <unk> on people in california ."
"i am optimistic . you know , the french and the japanese have made something as this ."
this is a real thing that was made .
"this is a important step forward , but it &apos;s like a fast watts and some countries built that band-aid , and therefore , you know , that everyone has conventional way of <unk> into our first capture ."
"in its engagement , a way of <unk> , and chances of it really do this &quot; instead of living ?"
"<unk> : well , we need one of those <unk> issues , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have <unk> for 20 years and then have <unk> for 20 years ."
it &apos;s kind of the test as we lose the blood scan that we need to get .
"and , you know , <unk> <unk> , if all everything goes to everything great , that &apos;s a big wish he could easily hold on ."
"and fortunately now , there are dozens of companies today , and we have now , hundreds of things that need their business systems to work their laboratory systems , and they can design <unk> for their contribution ."
"and it &apos;s the best if there were many ways to be <unk> , therefore then you could use a complicated <unk> ."
"so anyway , we need a solution ."
"<unk> of the significant humanitarian awful , is this the most possible component you know ?"
<unk> : an <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
"it would be without the <unk> or the <unk> , but in doing this sort of matter it for that much of time ."
"and at <unk> , there are other innovations ."
"you know , we know their labor doesn &apos;t make as well as well , but there &apos;s some progress in doing this ."
"there &apos;s a medical network that seems to look very difficult , but maybe we &apos;re actually saying something about you ."
"and so there &apos;s some things , but the beautiful thing about that a bridge <unk> is going to have so many social energy like , we say , a single , and so that , when you <unk> with the problems and the capacity for finding footprint and concentrated produced the increases , the exponentially within the commons"
"so when this doesn &apos;t happen , what is the time ?"
is something we need to do <unk> to try to maintain the <unk> to supply cocaine ?
"<unk> : when you &apos;re in that situation , it &apos;s like the <unk> to eat too much , and the a expense , for a comparison . so , what do you need <unk> ? you might do have of a <unk> or whatever ."
there &apos;s a research advance <unk> called <unk> doing for these various techniques to engage the warming to avoid so that we are spending 20 or 30 years of a decade to come on .
this is just an infrared <unk> .
we &apos;re one of them to call the notion of nuclear politics .
"some people say , to see , they &apos;re not going to work at least not just just because it should make that it add emergency , if you step <unk> on , because you know that <unk> will save the little rescue <unk> ."
"i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re smart , if you practice that problem before you have this problem , but you have a lot of the problem in front of why you need to be on power , or on how long when we need producing a innovation ."
<unk> : did you have one or two <unk> for them for <unk> .
"<unk> : well , unfortunately , life <unk> the <unk> in very different <unk> ."
"the scientific that are kind of on the scientific term , they &apos;re very little ."
"tell you that there are negative impacts , what are plants being and <unk> with these things ?"
"there &apos;s very , very few things you can actually say , on a given opportunity to get into a million ."
and <unk> is like this with aids .
"you move on by the mistakes now , and you &apos;ll vote it for a lot that you get ."
"and so the idea is now , to talk about all sorts of science , in something you &apos;ve got has left next later , and from if -- and ? the investment is not really so clear . tone , but is not really the zipcar dancer ."
the fact is that this deal gay people should worry .
"but my dream here is , if you can make it <unk> <unk> and you get blood out , then you pay the <unk> . &quot; okay , it &apos;s not as quickly me as much <unk> , i &apos;m phillips the co2 that it is , i am encouraging ."
"and that would provide its response to <unk> that once you and energy treat abundant on all time to solve the co2 , all the other goals in below their cooperation , as much as it can is poverty and further 40 rises and how they do it to fix ."
"<unk> : well , the actual spending spending on the research -- let &apos;s say the seriousness of saving 10 billion per year is more than we do today -- this isn &apos;t that dramatic ."
tissues should do not suffer the loss .
"you &apos;ve got too big facebook , and you can disagree with people as well as you &apos;re carrying something that &apos;s not going to come back and tries to predict it . in giving me the most successful ."
"it &apos;s like , for a point <unk> response to a deal , and studying <unk> just the climate rates , and i think we should try to try to do more things which have a lot of too much clean ."
"if you can get <unk> those driving that you get high school in one there &apos;s just a very <unk> , the bigger that the apartments have to be over ."
"i mean , every crazy time you could spend that clinically little time that the times our brain could thousands of times as our leaders ."
but the bottom two billion but this is a disaster .
and even pure is thought .
"your new scientist is now , &quot; why will the research not waste better ? &quot;"
"he &apos;ll have now , because of his earlier findings interact with the previous civilization , but he understood that this is a very lonely pack group , and that &apos;s why he takes right now to put that ."
and that &apos;s an <unk> that i think to be more predictable .
"on research , it &apos;s just crazy as <unk> as it is only commitment ."
"bill , i believe in almost all of the people here , if i say , i hope that your wish is true . thank you very much , thank you so ."
<unk> : thank you .
"on this one conference for us , so this has offered peter <unk> to speak called &quot; <unk> . &quot;"
"the idea is pretty simple . southern <unk> , <unk> your notions of country , about 20 <unk> of <unk> to build about <unk> images , of a scanning transfer of battery program ."
and the point of the communication industry has to be on top .
"and even though it just seems like this , it &apos;s really hard , because you &apos;re hoping people are very quickly at work ."
"so i thought this &apos;s an interesting idea , and i copies it and myself turn into a track of vision ."
it was a big success .
"since week , i did about 70 percent flow in the world with students , with doctors and architects even with environmental technologies , and with some of those problems &apos;s process about what psychological programs basically try and study by scenarios , some of them ."
they normally start from <unk> people to stroke their use .
they talk about what they &apos;re doing to how it &apos;s taken by <unk> to it .
"they bring them a little time into planning and organization , and they <unk> and they <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
it invest that most of their time as they work out of the lighting form <unk> structures .
"and finally , shortly before you don &apos;t have time , anyone takes a prize , and makes him gets the <unk> on the top of the top , get a step back and pieces of &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> her work ."
so what &apos;s happened is it &apos;s almost always in terms of <unk> called a &quot; club &quot; because the <unk> of the transition comes from doing all the things .
"there &apos;s a whole set of people who &apos;ve seen a much more &quot; <unk> &quot; condition , between other people , and the worst , coming out has big ."
"you lie , you <unk> , you get confused and you can actually get arbitrary steel ."
"and then of course , we &apos;re getting them <unk> raped in a much more <unk> , and so under their best of successful new teach me ."
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
"so why peter told us , they get not just the worst towers , but we also experience most interesting structures from all ."
what do you think will be questions like this ? why is it ? what about those ?
and peter babylon : &quot; don &apos;t give a half of the children to be in <unk> . &quot;
you don &apos;t spend time in grade blue .
you see there &apos;s still one more reasons .
"this effort that we have been making dance <unk> the right plan , ok ."
and then trying to realize him .
"and what happens when you <unk> it up , you &apos;ve got a tiny time to the top , you have no time december and what happens ?"
it &apos;s a crisis .
"sound points , what ?"
"what does creativity do is they start with the initial abalone tree , a piece of team , some prototypes , computers becoming at least so that they use cancer <unk> it into the top prototype discovery with legos ."
so <unk> builds these kinds of collaboration as the core of a special .
"and with each trial , kids are getting directly into feedback starting in contact , and what &apos;s not ."
and that is how performance begin to work with prototype mechanisms -- but let &apos;s see how <unk> teams .
"the average one for most of these is about eight years <unk> . from half , lack more , lawyers , but not much , are much better than their adult ."
who &apos;s the most successful ?
"architects and designers , to be very successful ."
and the <unk> is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
"and why ? because you learn ancient and <unk> patterns , they also understand the key to building malaria ."
<unk> : one here is what matters . but this is what &apos;s interesting .
"you put a huge disconnect on the team , you <unk> better ."
it &apos;s incredibly . and you can see this is going . &quot;
"you can predict , why &apos;s this stuff going ?"
because they have particular talents of information networks .
"they &apos;re facing the process , they love him ."
"and that team into work , and they go and work out on , and it will make by structure better instruments ."
<unk> skills and <unk> and collaborative and connecting its combination .
"if you put 10 teams you play growing holes , they get about six , the stable structure ."
i was doing something interesting now .
i thought we &apos;ll get the window right and fold it .
so i army give a <unk> for software for software .
what did they think about those <unk> ?
what was the result ?
"this happened . not a team , that had a organized structure ."
"so if the <unk> used to be a <unk> level , it would have shut the price to go home ."
"so , isn &apos;t it interesting that high <unk> have an entirely available ?"
we take an hour with this same students .
now what did you think it happened ?
now they <unk> the <unk> to the word <unk> .
"this is from the same , very bad as bad <unk> one with the best ."
they produced the highest construction in itself time .
"so again , it &apos;s very confident for us that nature is in terms of products and success ."
"you like questions , why would someone actually spend time making a conscious part ?"
"the reason i create is how economics tools and <unk> enable teams to help help work cars , video videos and &quot; how to create <unk> . &quot;"
and what <unk> <unk> is it makes you help hiding <unk> .
"because <unk> , each image has its own communication to force ."
"the challenge is that somehow a <unk> experience , with a common piece of language , i think of ngos , our control piece of information ."
"and that &apos;s a progress that &apos;s experience , that &apos;s that kind of simple , function ."
and those of you who are interested in trying to see .
"it &apos;s a blog , where you see that you &apos;re building ."
there &apos;s a coffee district there .
"they found crazy examples of the world , like people are documenting the system and trying to break it up ."
there &apos;s also <unk> .
"and the <unk> lesson , i think it &apos;s a functioning sports condition ."
"it brings up to us that we all our senses to our own ways and that we do our thinking , we use sense of how our emotions and our industries -- the challenge that is beyond ourselves ."
"and sometimes a small <unk> of this experience , everything that requires we to bring out of a computer company &quot; -- to a <unk> <unk> &quot; ."
and it can make a huge difference .
thank you .
can we be doing this in a machine like this ?
"one great machine , a cool machine , brilliant machine , and that &apos;s a device machine engineering ."
and everyone in this room must be inside .
"and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay here at the bottom and now ."
and i wonder what they were going to choose because i gave my friends some of the time more choices and quickly .
"i don &apos;t know . they wanted back to the time before , until people gave cars or twitter &quot; instead of where america &apos;s <unk> . &quot;"
i &apos;m not sure .
i am convinced that they are sort of done and sort of to be better at <unk> .
and i understand it .
"i &apos;m not part of that team , i &apos;ve got to say ."
"i don &apos;t want to occur one in the past , not because i &apos;m an <unk> -- after that ."
"it &apos;s because opportunities to planet are not back on this planet , its way away ."
"so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future ."
"this is the <unk> period that has ever <unk> on this planet , no matter of the dimension we <unk> you -- <unk> and you know , mobility , intense <unk> ."
"so there have been never been the past before , any of these ."
"my <unk> died , all the ones as babies were ."
my grandparents used to be this number of wood breasts .
and my parents are the 80 on the diagrams .
so there should be better at the beginning of nine lines i started .
"but it &apos;s not really about people like us , because this is one bigger deal ."
one kid who can do in <unk> today can expect to be used as long as the rift years ago on the <unk> 30 years ago .
think about it . it &apos;s an unbelievable fact .
"now , why is that ?"
smallpox -- smallpox had billions of people lived on this planet .
"they have the demographics in the earth in a sense , actually when it does not have existed in war ."
they &apos;re getting away . they &apos;ve gone .
we <unk> them . <unk> .
"the poor world exist governments that exist only by whom they have considered one generation still , very little ."
"<unk> , <unk> , fatty , <unk> ..."
"do anybody <unk> at all though , what that &apos;s happening ?"
"<unk> , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of data , are <unk> to scientific technique ."
"and in my view , the scientific method is <unk> , of see because it works , it &apos;s going to change if it doesn &apos;t do it , it <unk> a great evolution of humanity ."
so that &apos;s the good news .
"unfortunately , this is already the whole good news , because there &apos;s some other problems , and people got said often about it ."
"and one of it , <unk> , of all of our favorites , is one billion people in studying high school seven people in this world everyday ."
"and this number moves , and it goes very fast , and it &apos;s suspended ."
"not just thinking about this , we &apos;ve added our imagination to remove this world ."
"water , <unk> land , <unk> , oil , oil , abundant , as they disappear , and every fall of time we don &apos;t take ourselves out of this natural chaos ."
"so , the question is : can we do this ? i think ."
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will provide billions of people without going to feed it to gender employees on their lives .
"well , i think we can have some world that impossible you can &apos;t meet at the same time ."
"i truly believe that and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> ."
"but that keeps my opinion above night -- one of those things that kids fail to keep me in the night . we &apos;ve <unk> scientific progress from the meantime in time , no longer ."
"and we were even able to <unk> him that same is , as we can ."
"we are at the threshold perspective of encyclopedia in many factories , and i &apos;m really thinking we have hundreds of 150,000 years ago to go back to face a time that we had to find detailed consuming things that we found ."
"people were holding in their belief , and they &apos;re so much educated they can &apos;t hurt you ."
not even the truth will <unk> it .
"and listen , each one has a right to his mind , and even a really <unk> to its opinion ."
"but you know what you don &apos;t have a right , right ?"
"they didn &apos;t face up relative to their own facts . &apos; <unk> <unk> , don &apos;t you ."
and i used a while to do that .
"about a decade ago , i was writing about <unk> for versus new yorker , a little article ."
"and i was <unk> to start resistance with resistance , about what &apos;s due to the most appropriate level of health <unk> in the history of the human history of humanity ."
"i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just do what i was saying , i was writing a article and walking ahead ."
"and soon , i wrote a article about <unk> different the <unk> <unk> ."
"the same thing , only bigger ."
they were playing crazy .
"so i also writing an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t tell to why people thought that would be &quot; important &quot; , &quot; why they thought they were actually just a certain kind of chemical <unk> act on nature as a kind of lab center ."
"but you know , i do what i do . i wrote over the article before , so i continued ."
"i mean , i &apos;m journalist ."
"we &apos;re talking about , we &apos;re going to experts , this is &quot; okay ."
"but that article was worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i found it ."
and that &apos;s because that sign that actually failed me was not at all .
"they were hungry people , they were <unk> people , <unk> people ."
they were exactly the way people in this room .
and that brought me up this kind of thing .
"but then , i thought , you know , this is quite honest ."
we &apos;re up at the point that we have not the same relationship as we thought .
we speak wow about that .
"we &apos;re going to talk lower , on a little project that &apos;s about -- &quot; progress . &quot;"
"okay , i think that &apos;s for a good thing and i think of you the reasons that are ."
"we trust obama towards government , and sometimes always has lost in science , and there is no reason why that should not be ."
you &apos;re capable of just calling some names and the people get to understand .
"<unk> : <unk> , the <unk> , mastery name , <unk> , the 2,000 stones ."
"i mean , you know , you can select your own list ."
there are questions and problems with the people we thought that they &apos;re all always &apos;s right .
"imagine asking questions , do all this evidence , desire them ."
take nothing and gave you as an first .
"but it goes right . now , if you have to get evidence to set the evidence , we &apos;re not for it good ."
"and i can say this out of the reason that we now live in the national operating system , like i &apos;ve never seen again , hopefully we &apos;ll see again ."
"about 12 years ago , a story had , a horrible story that lasted , i made the higgs <unk> with the invention of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> mass destruction ."
very scary .
<unk> studies were done to see if that was happening .
the early <unk> ought to be done a is causing economic problem .
the data coming in .
"the data came in from the united states , out of england , from sweden , from sell countryside , and they were all so appropriate , there is no differential , don &apos;t relation to anybody ."
"doesn &apos;t make difference . they don &apos;t make the difference , because we believe in <unk> , we think what we can see what we think we &apos;re going to believe that we are actually feeling into work ."
"we don &apos;t really believe in an instant <unk> that has introduced data to us , and i understand what i think we do ."
but do you know what ?
and the outcome of this is <unk> .
"and in fact , pancreatic reference , is one of the world in one in the world where the soviet food is <unk> for war <unk> ."
"it &apos;s something nice to say , and we should smile ."
it &apos;s horrible .
what happened is we could do that .
now i understand it . i do that .
because there is someone here in this <unk> ?
does it have you ever have somebody who &apos;s going to die of <unk> for someone ?
not often happen .
the dignity no longer than that country is happening in the workforce over the last year .
"these are lots of death from <unk> , 20 hour ."
"but because that didn &apos;t happen here , we can do it <unk> , and people like elizabeth peter <unk> and messages of stress and tables so <unk> <unk> and larry brown live ."
and you can do that because they don &apos;t connect problems and break it .
they don &apos;t understand they seem <unk> thing to be able to <unk> but they have essentially the same thing .
"and that &apos;s kind of fair that we need to learn to learn to , and it &apos;s very fast ."
"that guy was a hero , including action ."
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humankind .
"no fear , not a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ."
the guy in the middle isn &apos;t much it .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> <unk> .
he &apos;s developing some people &apos;s day of a <unk> .
"he &apos;s able to save the lives of <unk> , do children using the developing world , in the developing world ."
"very good , right ?"
"well , this is good , <unk> that paul <unk> and <unk> , and say , &quot; how valuable it is and it &apos;s people of and that just should stop <unk> . &quot;"
and that &apos;s where he &apos;s actually telling .
jose is truly a terrorist of my last .
"when paul &apos;s in a leading public war , he doesn &apos;t link to any arms aircraft ."
he gets contact out over at home because people like to tell him they know where his kids walk to school .
and why ? because paul did an vaccine .
"i don &apos;t need to say this , but we &apos;re pretty <unk> ."
"if you take you to look , get those <unk> , horrible types , and you &apos;re going to do it right now ."
we &apos;ve arrived in this country now .
"and that goes apart , and quite quickly you &apos;ll die back by it , because only is only one question of pay ."
and they &apos;re not just going to be children at <unk> .
what about <unk> ? suppose we do it . why not ?
"a girl &apos;s <unk> me in front of weeks i wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i think she &apos;s a <unk> ."
nobody heard that before you .
she wouldn &apos;t want to <unk> her kids down . no accident .
bank doors .
why ? because we have no diet . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have <unk> in this country yesterday .
"today , i don &apos;t know , if anyone at lagos , in lagos quickly flew right now and won kibera , from los angeles at the moment ."
"and in some like <unk> , he <unk> and he <unk> a car , and he comes up from a <unk> , and he will show an 15 of your sperm career here tonight ."
"and he knows that he &apos;s being <unk> with a fundamental disease , and we &apos;re not familiar with that , since the world now works ."
so this is the planet we live on . don &apos;t do just as if they are not .
we love it to be <unk> ourselves . we love it .
do you have their dying morning this one anytime .
"don &apos;t look a little bit , make them help the <unk> project ."
i know you have done that because the half of americans makes them it every day .
"they take the stuff , and they take <unk> for alternative , and it doesn &apos;t make something different as we <unk> to remind them ."
it &apos;s the data which assemble each other .
they just beyond their <unk> ; they <unk> they don &apos;t .
"you &apos;re okay , you love to pay 28 billion dollars to a dark 4,000 ."
i &apos;ll write very completely .
dark chemicals . dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do this ?
"now , i think that i think we -- we hate the <unk> ."
we hate bad government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t do it too . our health medical health medical system has been <unk> .
it &apos;s they &apos;re <unk> million .
"it &apos;s absolutely completely cold , and corporate even being applied to us that can afford it ."
"so we &apos;re walking away , so where we &apos;re going ?"
we go into the arms &apos;s arms .
that &apos;s actually a great big . i love listening .
"but you know , that &apos;s really good arguing because the stuff is persistent , and there &apos;s about billions of dollars out there ."
and i have all kinds of little <unk> here .
"second part of -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , there i don &apos;t even know what it is , but we give up billion dollars for that , it &apos;s existed ."
"and you know what ? when i say that , you know , they like me sing and you say , &quot; what makes you work ? we &apos;re getting what people want ."
that &apos;s what your sense are . &quot;
you know what ? you have <unk> .
"because , i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s that <unk> ; that &apos;s going to say , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to ignore the kids of my parents &apos; <unk> to pass a coin or some <unk> that wanted to treat his patients ."
"and if you &apos;re <unk> up on that way , where liberal <unk> and magic , they have to take place to a place where it is not like it ."
they take into <unk> <unk> in south africa .
"he put some <unk> of his people &apos;s soul on that because he kept down that red and unnecessary stations , <unk> have been much <unk> towards many drugs , which we know that they can spend the course of aids ."
hundreds of thousands of deaths would lie much worse than any other one else is being <unk> .
tell me that those things are not having a consequence .
they have them . they &apos;re running they &apos;re all .
"now , the magic agent that we &apos;re at is this swiss <unk> between the <unk> <unk> performance <unk> over the ink and development penalty ."
that &apos;s a <unk> debate . it &apos;s needing to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words about abroad .
"this is ideology , not science ."
"we have access , every season , every <unk> <unk> to <unk> , everybody &apos;s <unk> , altered from people ."
"you know , there &apos;s no way paradise in paradise ."
there was no <unk> .
there &apos;s no <unk> <unk> . we did this it all .
"we &apos;ve made it already in the last 10,000 years ."
and <unk> had worked and never happened .
we &apos;re related to what has didn &apos;t work .
"we can do it place . and of course we can be . but we can do something like <unk> a little compared to rice , and this stuff can help millions , millions of people , to give your life ."
do you don &apos;t . do this ?
i &apos;ve got to say i don &apos;t see it .
we rate hidden food increased food .
why do we do that ?
"now , as i &apos;m missing myself , it is to lots of chemicals , using chemical , hormones , we don &apos;t want a function of &#91; physics &#93; to one thing ."
we don &apos;t want companies to be eating food .
we don &apos;t want like economic exist .
and you know what the answer on all this is .
"yeah , you guys have right . we actually design that ."
"it &apos;s true , we have tremendous <unk> , but it &apos;s not science ."
that has nothing to do with science .
"it &apos;s right , morality <unk> ."
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not another idea . it &apos;s a process .
"it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and it does not be , but the idea we should not allow to do what the work is because we &apos;re <unk> more <unk> , and it &apos;s a function of millions of people in relation to <unk> ."
"and you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to lose 70 percent more food than we need to fight for a moment . 70 percent ."
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
"they need this , and we &apos;ll not give it to you ."
and why ? food changed food .
we don &apos;t want guys to eat it cash stuff for cool things like <unk> .
<unk> is something that we eat half a billion people .
it &apos;s about as a anyway .
it &apos;s just a lot of calories . it &apos;s <unk> .
"it &apos;s not a kitchen , it &apos;s got no protein , and scientists are building all this in there ."
"and then people could eat it , and they would not be blind ."
"they wouldn &apos;t hurt , and you know what ?"
"that &apos;s going to be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be clear , but it &apos;d be beautiful ."
"and all i can tell you , why is that <unk> ?"
"i mean , why are we going to <unk> us : why <unk> do we mean it ?"
"you know , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> competition ?"
that &apos;s not about the gene that &apos;s living . it &apos;s not about renewables .
"that is not about reaching our non-verbal passion for competitive food , our <unk> -- better food , better food ."
"there isn &apos;t religious <unk> making bananas ; it &apos;s about giving people &apos;s people to make them , and it &apos;s going to evolve off an take time , to understand what it &apos;s going to mean ."
right ? do you know what ?
"when we do not employ it as we continue to do something like we ask , from which we believe we can <unk> , don &apos;t be creator , <unk> anymore ."
so there &apos;s no new description for what &apos;s going on .
"it &apos;s more accurate . it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not high-tech , it &apos;s not personal . we really have to stop that ."
"so after this incredibly funny <unk> conversation , you may say , &quot; you want to go on this pattern of time , time to this <unk> length and go to the future ? &quot;"
"not at any case , that &apos;s true , it &apos;s never going to be that any case ."
"right now , it &apos;s in the present challenge , but we have a tremendous opportunities ."
we can places that do on anything of this point .
"we can <unk> them , where we want to pull them down , and we are going to be <unk> where to ."
"we must have a significant , actually , think about knowing , but when we reach into terrain time , when the future gets slow , we will be happy , we &apos;re alone this ."
"i know we can , and actually it &apos;s much <unk> me to have , some of which the world needs ."
thank you .
thank you .
"so over an time , i worked for heart ages as i say you &apos;d be as curious about this , because they &apos;re part of the way i look at it as : &quot; <unk> a bet that &apos;s simply giving you just enough people . &quot;"
"in other words , design lives have shown a permanent effect , which shows very intriguing , which means that person is interested in , a <unk> and a <unk> , as well , there is perhaps , as here , as when you &apos;re a patient ."
one exercise becomes something very real because someone also do it so .
"and we also understand each other , i want to show you a perfect , just very simple steps ."
"and i &apos;m going to show you how he works , and this is a trick that has been at least as the 1950s in every <unk> in every <unk> ."
"and myself , i did him learning out their foster <unk> level of psychological <unk> down to the previous waiting process ."
i will do him for them and then explain it .
"and then i &apos;ll teach , important , why i <unk> to solve ."
"so , look what happens ."
"the knife they can consider , in a person who i can research to explore ."
i &apos;m going to hold the knives in my window as well .
i divide my hide away .
"and if actually make sure that nothing went out at my kitchen approach , or came out , i simply just ever actually <unk> my wrist ."
"so , you can see that there &apos;s no time moving to anything like this . so . as i can pull in you here , nothing else in my <unk> , or <unk> ."
and the significance of this is quite easy .
"i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully all if everything is going really well , the technologists will break through my mobile mood through ."
"in fact , it would probably drop to where i can shake and do it without <unk> the knife ."
"nothing comes out in into my name , oops , no <unk> . and they can analyze everything out ."
<unk> !
"now , this is a trick that i often get up so many different kids talking about radical about because you can learn much very much about it , when you &apos;re really <unk> to see it a very simple trick ."
the number of you see here in this one line .
they contain the <unk> that way .
i own the knife in my hand .
"i &apos;m saying that i <unk> my door to prove it &apos;s getting away from my office cream or disappear , and that &apos;s a <unk> ."
the reason i <unk> my wrist is because that &apos;s the lighting system of the impression .
"if you go out the moment , where i get my hand out of you , to see her , it turned from this finger , my pick up , just behind one , where he was his right where he &apos;s so interactive ."
great differential comes ?
so there is somebody sitting behind who hadn &apos;t thousand .
so it turns out there . actually focused .
"and i feel more sacred in my fingers , life changes its position ."
"and there might be great on talking about why , why it &apos;s not , you can &apos;t think about three fingers , and the minds of the mind , though it is using information , it doesn &apos;t lie , b histories or three ."
"and that &apos;s not really different , and then i open my hand ."
"but of course it is <unk> there , but not through the paradox of my body , but through a trick , through my mood , that &apos;s in there ."
"and when i close my hand , they do this same thing by <unk> , when i keep moving down with that balloon , again , <unk> the color will back ."
"i take this hand out , and that &apos;s the knife ."
this trick is <unk> to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
"well , what &apos;s the way that they &apos;re doing to this , right ?"
"two to a year or so , i just read a study i really <unk> myself ."
"i &apos;m not a physician or researchers , and so that was something that i &apos;ve done to do ."
"it turns out , that , because if you have a <unk> function in the form of white tomatoes , in a form of a material , it &apos;s just a tiger attacker that has a particular effect ."
"but if you get the shape you <unk> , say that you &apos;re having a push into a smaller ship , and those blue cell <unk> and put on that dopamine , which is actually <unk> <unk> ."
"and they mean , even though they have any use of it -- it &apos;s just <unk> ."
but a white pill is not as well as a blue pill .
what ? i really <unk> that up to me .
but it turns out that this is not all happened .
"if you take <unk> , you &apos;re still colored standard than everybody is ."
a <unk> video of space that is right after the top of the right is the better than a white group .
the same being <unk> as well .
one pill every day is not as good as three bits -- i can &apos;t afford to know the extreme -- sorry .
<unk> : but the <unk> .
"that the <unk> , the more play best ."
and the shape plays a role .
"and if you &apos;ve answered that initial stick , you must <unk> the grid ."
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- some rope an invasive substance it within patients .
this generates a very productive picture in their head ; it &apos;s very much stronger than a <unk> database .
"so , this photograph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time if we have an vehicle ."
what really is that the <unk> are not as well as the blue pill that didn &apos;t just like the blue pill as something like a hair which had not as much as <unk> as the needle .
"and none of the things have really an emotion that is doing this , and it &apos;s only our belief that takes us as a stronger impact on us ."
and i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a <unk> .
"i &apos;ll take a pitch a nuclear force , and it &apos;s actually going to really look like ."
we know from this study that you have to make the needle if it &apos;s about to the negotiations .
"this is a <unk> foot artist . it &apos;s very , very , very , very embarrassing , and i &apos;m going to bring you a little date ."
this is really my meat . this is not western meat .
and this is my skin . this is not a <unk> &apos;s from hollywood .
"i &apos;m now going to put through this needle in my motor , and through it , again , until again , they all come back to the other side ."
"if you go on -- if you wake up in <unk> -- i first ran a couple of friends in <unk> <unk> , some people i didn &apos;t know , and on and i did not think a woman were almost <unk> ."
"so i wear up when you take a fast , i &apos;ll look at them for the next 30 seconds . they look for you , or , you know , you know what , i &apos;m going to get in the first 10 round of it right ?"
"you can see that instantly , you can either roll it away , just when you want to ."
"so , this is right here , <unk> the center of my meat begins on the bottom of my mouth i &apos;m just going to make you out a little <unk> ."
so i &apos;m happy . do you crazy ?
and just a little bit through my skin and the other side of this as let out .
"now , we &apos;re in the same situation we had in the animals ."
about about .
"so , now you can &apos;t count my finger . right ?"
"so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , four , four , five ."
"well , nonetheless ."
i know what people think about when you see that .
"they said , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not very serious and <unk> itself , just to fall together to <unk> for some of us in that . &quot;"
well now i &apos;m going to show you .
how does that see this from ? pretty well .
yes . i know .
"and people end up <unk> , &quot; all right . i haven &apos;t really seen this stuff . &quot;"
so people who are in the <unk> go now .
let me show you a bit of that close to .
that &apos;s really my skin . this is not a <unk> from hollywood .
"this is my meat , and i can get in this ."
"i &apos;m sorry to hide you -- look away , don &apos;t look at the things ."
"now , the people <unk> , or those that later gets to a video at some point , and let &apos;s say , &quot; well , this is quite enjoyable , but if it would be , you &apos;re this little hole , &quot; and when never was a small hole ."
"okay , let me give you a little blood to break that for you ."
"yeah , that &apos;s different ."
and i would normally play this <unk> now .
i &apos;d call my arm altogether automated and show you that there &apos;s no cure .
"but i think there &apos;s an <unk> menu , and very technical idea of making a real thing , i &apos;ll just put it out here , and how that scene is on , and so on , on stage ."
"now , we &apos;ll meet a few days in the next days ."
so i hope you &apos;re seeing that . thank you very much .
each talk to the happiness .
"i have struck some people in the number of books who have gotten fantastic to the names in the last five years , and they &apos;d launched about 40 and after about 40 , and there was a lot more ."
there &apos;s a massive <unk> <unk> shift under happiness .
there &apos;s many <unk> legs .
everybody would like to <unk> people .
"but even despite all this <unk> of work , there are several cognitive applications that don &apos;t , sort of , in some sense , they are far wrong ."
and my talk today is just going to look certified by these tiny cognitive survival .
"this is the subject of honesty that think about your own awareness , and it &apos;s to be interested in scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that &apos;s all the way that everybody else is ."
"it &apos;s first that you will fall into a viral , to do reverse <unk> ."
"turns out that the word luck is just it anymore because we apply it to many different things , a way , for different things ."
"i think there is an individual meaning we might have 13 , but it &apos;s all over and enormous , and it &apos;s something we need to give and we need to give up , and that &apos;s <unk> path that is <unk> ecology ."
"the second case is an <unk> experience and <unk> : all they have been in his lives and happy his life out of his life , or be happy with his life ."
"and those are two very different concepts , and they both both do the idea in thinking about happiness ."
"and the third is the reality , and this is hitler &apos;s mind that we can &apos;t think of entirely , mind what allows decision to predict our significance of the unique question ."
"i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive shadow ."
it just doesn &apos;t have a way to get it right .
"so now i would like to start a 25 ask of someone who had this test after a clip professor <unk> , who said to another one <unk> -- he said he had a <unk> ever heard , and it was a gorgeous gold and third tradition ."
"and then he had two really sweet , really and it gives <unk> through all of these regrets ."
but it didn &apos;t .
what they had failed for experience was the impact .
he had the experience .
he had <unk> music for 20 minutes .
"she didn &apos;t involve him , because in a <unk> of laughter , take memory and <unk> was all the memory to do ."
"what that is really what we are , that we could think of this , as other people can think , that &apos;s how many parts of each of themselves ."
"now it &apos;s an <unk> self , living in the present and the present , is possible to experience the past again , but basically the present has the present ."
"it &apos;s <unk> , the lawyer , the physician <unk> -- you know , if the doctor says , &quot; does that right now , if i put it in a day ? &quot;"
"and then there &apos;s one <unk> self , and the final sense of it &apos;s being <unk> and the story that separates our life and is it that is that the physician tells the <unk> , &quot; what do you feel aware ? &quot; and how could you have shot ?"
or &quot; how was your journey to make it like <unk> or something similar .
"these are two extremely different conversations , the most <unk> self , the shopping safety force themselves , and the two to come to <unk> in part of the task learns by happiness ."
"now , the yemen itself is a <unk> ."
and that actually starts to start with an <unk> response on our personality -- the moment starts immediately .
it &apos;s not only about all the story that we &apos;re going to face that up to tell stories .
"our memory tells us stories , the <unk> of what we &apos;ve been able to keep ourselves from our passions is a story ."
and let &apos;s start through a example of one .
we have an old study study .
this is the actual patients doing a great <unk> device .
"i &apos;m not going to get into detail . she &apos;s not so much <unk> , but she was really painful , as it was done in the &apos; air economy ."
they were asked to tell everyone 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . those are their records .
"and you &apos;ll ask you , &quot; who &apos;s got more <unk> ? &quot;"
and this is a very simple question .
"patient b has <unk> more <unk> , <unk> , and every minute of pain , every minute of passed a cars of health , <unk> <unk> , and more ."
but you have a different question : &quot; how very many patients were that you were <unk> ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that camp has a much worse choices that she had they <unk> as patients .
the stories of <unk> were different because they &apos;re highly <unk> .
and none of these stories are very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear .
but one of them is very apparent as others .
"and the worse is the fact that , from the sense , where the pain was remained falling . it &apos;s much black , but it &apos;s a sad story ."
how do we know ?
because we asked these people after their <unk> with time and then <unk> : &quot; how bad was the entire thing was going ? &quot;
and it was much faster for it for an b in the website .
"well , that &apos;s a profound gap between the <unk> itself , and even the <unk> itself ."
"to understand it even a reality is that <unk> place , also a fake time ."
"now what you could do with patient a trillion and we &apos;ve actually done participants , and we &apos;ve actually made trials , and it &apos;s done , you know , we could actually put the lowest &quot; through the patient in you healing with you a city distance . &quot;"
"it &apos;s going to lead that patients are suffering from consumers , but only a little bit less than something in the womb ."
"and if you have a story for two minutes , you will do that the <unk> itself takes your patient from worse is rather than choices that <unk> your own a vehicle a much better , because now average you have a better patients ."
<unk> represent a story ?
and that &apos;s for the stories that charge up the memory and it &apos;s true for the stories that we learn .
"local <unk> itself is a story that is very grim , <unk> and &apos; impact ."
"so at this point , very important and in this case , it breaks down the end ."
"well , that troubles itself lives their lives in life ."
"it has times of the <unk> , a after another ."
"and they ask , what does this occasion ?"
and the answer really is just good . they &apos;re lost forever .
"i mean , most of our lives , here &apos;s life -- and i &apos;ve <unk> the age of <unk> -- you know , about <unk> at about three seconds . which means that it does have about 8,000 of them in roughly a million . i &apos;ve involves what come into a month ."
most of you will fit completely from your local self .
and yet they kind of get of <unk> that they need to count the idea that what happens during these and areas of life is our lives .
"it &apos;s the highest resource we use , as we do in it ."
"and we seem to used to be important , but it &apos;s not the story that holding ourselves its own recording force ."
"and so here &apos;s what we have <unk> ourselves , and they &apos;re really fairly innocent ."
and the most important part of you are the regime rate of time .
"from a <unk> perspective , once you &apos;ve had an trade party and it &apos;s in a second exactly as well as the first clip is , the big <unk> ."
that &apos;s an actual way for a poor body of <unk> .
"and it &apos;s actually much better for <unk> cancer than <unk> <unk> , because they &apos;re not going to have a new paradigm troll video ."
and they &apos;re not . they &apos;ve gone alive .
"and so in that case , really , the critical burden that is living the investment <unk> itself from a road itself -- still has very very , very little effect on this story ."
"well , the <unk> act more will do to remember and to tell stories ."
"it &apos;s actually those decisions that make the decisions , because you have a patient , you say two <unk> in two different surgeons and <unk> , which one has why you choose which is the surprising and that significantly is that arrested in your mind ."
the <unk> itself has no voice in that oven .
"well , we don &apos;t choose between change . we choose <unk> <unk> in between <unk> ."
"and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t normally think of our future as this top-down future ."
we think about our future as an emerging <unk> issue .
"and indeed , you can take it from a round of expression , you can have a system of <unk> itself , and you can think of the more <unk> yourself as one , which is more precious by trust our own <unk> itself ."
"i think the idea that if we &apos;re here on the board of whales , it is usually a lot of the case that is called something left initiative to be <unk> in the service of <unk> itself ."
and that &apos;s a very hard part i think .
"i mean , how much <unk> are we off by our <unk> ?"
this is a <unk> that is going through your <unk> of <unk> itself .
"and when i think about this , i think of a <unk> that we have taken a few years before towards antarctica , that was clear of the best epiphany that i &apos;ve ever had ever had , i think a bit and doing a lot of it a half what i &apos;m known as a <unk> i &apos;m"
"and i probably had about my favorite early journey , and i would say about 25 minutes took in the last four years ."
"well , if i had the average open for the <unk> that a total gather happen at it ."
"well , these are three weeks , and they are in an hour and a half hours ."
there is an <unk> operation to be .
"so i likes a kind of extraordinarily , you know , like caught in a <unk> , but even if you take that from scratch , it &apos;s a real question for us : do you give the privilege of <unk> a special effect from that we used to <unk> in the <unk> , as much sense the aid"
"so , i want you to think about the experiment that had thought happy ."
"so imagine , amongst that <unk> , right , you know that at the end of the series of aviation , all of this will be <unk> and will get a flexible drug to the number of them <unk> this ."
"well , would you chose the same wait ?"
"and if you have one other south , there &apos;s a turkey between them who <unk> them , and you have to think about how afterward and as it does not just true , because when you get a <unk> response to focus on time and lecture ."
and why we &apos;re taking the <unk> that we &apos;re looking at achieving a problem that &apos;s <unk> a rule between the two species of that each .
now the two things about ourselves in their own are looking at happiness .
"there are two collaboration from happiness that we can apply , one of even one 24 ."
so now you can ask : how happy does this touch themselves ?
and then you want to ask : how happy do these equality live in terms of <unk> even ?
"and they all are -- lucky for moments , you know , if you &apos;re a rather complicated , repeat ."
which is the emotions that can have a chance ?
"and by the way , we are now any kind of really good ideas of happiness , at age yourself , if we are at times ."
"so if you ask , for the happiness itself , people have a totally different thing ."
you have it not about how happy someone &apos;s person living .
it is what happens to you get from life or someone &apos;s death when you think about it &apos;s the person that is about it .
and very fantastic term .
"everybody who &apos;s not so different to <unk> study information , and i <unk> a lot of <unk> from <unk> aspects of personal democratic making the exploration of happiness long ."
"so the nerve <unk> between the very bottom of the enemy and the <unk> of the self has seen has been realized over the past years , and now you are approaching the two scale of chemicals ."
"the secular minister of finance has been <unk> over a <unk> series for more than one million people get asked about what they think about , and what their live life is about . and there were other tasks in the direction ."
"so in the last years , we started from the news that both of us are studying detail ."
and the challenge that we think that i think are learned to be separate from them .
"you can know how happy somebody is with his life , and to come back with the <unk> industry they really didn &apos;t affect how happy he lives and <unk> ."
"and it &apos;s just to give you a sense of resilience , which is roughly a <unk> experiment ."
"what does this mean is that if you were meeting people , and you &apos;re going to say , mama , is a new one , how much would you know about its size ?"
"well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of complications ."
you have a lot of emotional .
if i tells you that somebody &#91; will &#93; change than eight from a dozen <unk> of death games they did much emotionally on the many extent how he &apos;m happy to overcome .
so the kitchen little bit is carefully .
we know something that &apos;s actually defined the <unk> of the <unk> .
we know that money is very important to have goals that are so important .
we know our basic means there &apos;s best for being satisfied with people that we want to spend time with people we like .
"there are other pleasure , but this is fine ."
"so if you &apos;re lucky to the lucky two kind of personally , the <unk> are going to do a very different thing over the end of doing it ."
"now the <unk> , which i &apos;ve already said , is that we don &apos;t really think of happiness ought to be in a sense of well-being ."
it &apos;s a completely interesting term .
"now , about the bottom point of what we don &apos;t go very obvious for fortunately that we will think of happiness is we can &apos;t do at the same things when we &apos;re looking at life and when we &apos;re , really live ."
"so , when you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california in california will not get the <unk> answer ."
"if you ask the question that , folks , you know , you know , people living along to california when they tell us in there , in <unk> lives ."
"and what happens is that , when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference , we &apos;re about , is climate ."
"well , it turns out that climate is not very important for you in the process , and it &apos;s not even very important to your selves , as happy people are ."
"but , because the owner is <unk> itself , you can be on the end -- some people would stretch out for california ."
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people that end to california from hope to <unk> .
well your battery drives itself not going to be the <unk> .
we know this .
"but one thing is happening : you &apos;ll think that you &apos;re constrained because when you &apos;re think about you will be heard of about what impressed in , how <unk> does the weather in <unk> , and you feel that you &apos;ve made the <unk> decision ."
"it &apos;s very hard to think about engagement and i hope , i hope you &apos;ve figured that <unk> to how difficult it is ."
thank you .
thank you . i have a question of them .
thank you .
"well , by telling you in a few weeks ago , i learned to me that there was a fairly interesting conclusion that was coming from the <unk> <unk> coming from this led ."
is something that you can have the game in your <unk> by now is you have any duck by ?
daniel <unk> : certain <unk> .
i think that <unk> again <unk> that we discovered in the <unk> record is a number that we had absolutely not been comfortable with .
we figured it was <unk> to that in terms of happiness .
"if we <unk> , how emotion can be different from their income ."
"and it turns out that under an income population of 50 dollars in the year , for americans , and that is a very big , ahead of accidents , about 600,000 times , rainforests one week , per cup of income infected per year ."
"60,000 live ."
"<unk> : 60,000 ."
"60,000 dollars in the year are people slower , and they are becoming increasingly , being <unk> ."
and we get out of that particularly selfish line .
"i mean , i &apos;ve seen this <unk> sign sexy lines ."
"and what &apos;s happening is obviously that money is going to build an oil role on it , and that not the lack of money to make money <unk> , and we can measure that <unk> very , very clearly ."
"the judge , by the <unk> of itself , you get another story ."
"the more money you carry away , the longer you &apos;re ."
it &apos;s not for emotions .
"but douglas , in the all <unk> of the american culture , life , is order for research to cook ."
"if people were taking attention to those attempt , i mean it would seem to work on all that most , we think , take what we think more about <unk> and the problem on stage ."
is that a chance to say that politicians will spend a time kind of <unk> a bit like taking place and going on towards politics ?
"<unk> : you know , i think there &apos;s <unk> to the role of the health care system in politics ."
"the roots will become slowly be in the united states , not a question , but in the alhambra &apos;s happening and yet in other countries what happens ."
"the people are saying that you should think of happiness , if you think about politics ."
"so it &apos;ll take a long time ago and the people discuss whether you want to explore or whether they want to explore universality , so we need to live a serious <unk> ."
the luck problem with happiness is to <unk> different about how do you think and think in the <unk> self or may think about the aging place .
"the politics is going to be profoundly relevant , but i think , in the <unk> ."
"in the united states , they were losing to <unk> the population of the population ."
"this is going to be , i think , in the next two or two decades , of the national statistics ."
"well , it seems to me like this talk one , or , at least the <unk> priorities about its next few years to stand over ."
thank you so much for invention of <unk> .
"thank cambodia , richard <unk> ."
"i am jane <unk> , i get <unk> ."
"and i &apos;ve been paying for 10 years now , and i will approach the very next decade the way to go into no ways to save the world in reality , as it &apos;s been to save r <unk> ."
"i have a plan for this . i want to <unk> more people , including you know , spend more time with the play of more and more sophisticated games at all ."
now we &apos;re currently in three and billions of hours a week with biofuels .
"some of you might think , &quot; that &apos;s an oven-like amount of time for games . &quot;"
maybe something too much time when we think of how to solve what same bit to actually solve in the real world .
"but in fact , on the following point of saving off the future , is exactly the opposite ."
three billion hours a week than that -- are not unique enough to <unk> the world &apos;s <unk> problems of our planet .
"in fact , i &apos;m so determined that if we &apos;re going to <unk> this planet the next century that we &apos;re going to have to increase the time up ."
"i have <unk> that had every time at 21 rupees , oil is <unk> ."
"so maybe it looks something fascinating , so i cut it together to make it , i think , when we &apos;re living issues like hunger , global warming , global warming and <unk> , now i have to try and take certain arguments at least three billion section for the only a wide billion ."
"no , i mean it really seriously ."
"why ? so this picture <unk> very circuits very , the really argument that students are so so cognitive for survival of the human species in the future . serious about that ."
this is a desktop image of <unk> .
he wanted the feelings the shapes flying with them . so he built a camera down its tank .
this is one of the classic geometry in play .
"if you &apos;re not a player , you may never cry some of the shots in this picture ."
"you probably see that a narrative belief and fear of <unk> , but it <unk> to public <unk> , the dilemma of a really difficult problem ."
"when they play start , and you &apos;ll see some of the approaches to <unk> eyes , and their parents are a sign of optimism . the <unk> looks held to view ."
now this is a set that here stands in the <unk> of a so-called <unk> system .
"oh , you &apos;re familiar with this . ok . so around . so we &apos;ve got a couple of wishes ."
a <unk> victory is a cylinder that is so <unk> that has no way you didn &apos;t know that it was possible for possible .
it took almost beyond imagination .
"and if they get it to <unk> , they do make themselves so unable to . that &apos;s an enormous <unk> idealism ."
now that piece represents a movement why <unk> strength in a <unk> .
"and this is what we have to see on millions of faces on the world , as if we take the tiles of the next century , the face of the face of the pair of thumb <unk> ."
"fast lives , unfortunately , we actually see this picture in real life when we are when we <unk> trouble ."
"i hate it as a &quot; when i am , &quot; <unk> &quot; i feel bad , and it &apos;s actually my face , do you see ? right ? ok ?"
"that &apos;s i like , &quot; -- to me , i &apos;m so bad in life . &quot;"
"this is a center in my home home house in berkeley , and it &apos;s where i was going to be studying <unk> why we &apos;re at play in my music long time as a real life ."
here &apos;s a problem that is the adult with the players .
and we think that our truth is not as good as play .
"and i don &apos;t even want less , although i &apos;ve heard that ."
"we get a less player in time . i &apos;m going to do my head well with the motivation , to do something <unk> , inspired by collaboration ."
"if you &apos;re in an atheist , i believe that there are many of us are being our best paradigm would work , anytime or now <unk> the problem is helping science to do so well for many times as long as it can try to try the attack ."
"and unlike the reality , when we were failing , we actually break , we feel <unk> that often ."
"we feel sexually overwhelmed . we feel assumed that we feel threatened to be to make depressed , maybe depressed <unk> or <unk> ."
"these feelings have never , if we play games , it &apos;s not easy to play ."
and it &apos;s what i wanted to study as a <unk> .
"why is it impossible to think , do you always better in thinking ?"
"how do we , how can we be able to deal with those feelings which play in reality ?"
so i looked at games like world department in terms that <unk> it <unk> on to the <unk> of <unk> .
and i saw some of the things that you know &quot; <unk> win into <unk> . &quot;
"so , first time we put them in one of these online games , especially with world &apos;s scales , there are a whole bunch of different shapes that are willing to take you to ."
"but not only anybody needs any mission , but a mission that matches perfectly with their rio level -- right ?"
so you create this .
they never get an job that you cannot solve .
"but whenever it &apos;s same challenge , so they &apos;re <unk> to , but there are no <unk> in the world of shanghai ."
you &apos;re not <unk> around and spinning <unk> ; there &apos;s always some <unk> to do something that .
and they have <unk> victims .
"but , as you &apos;re getting out , hundreds of thousands of people working with them together to clean up their <unk> mission ."
"we don &apos;t have that in life anymore , not just by feeling that at <unk> employees are willing to say ."
"so there &apos;s a <unk> story , which is surprising history , not what we are ."
and then we end up driving that whole much safe feedback .
"you &apos;ve got a level of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; warming &quot; equivalent , &quot; b or a $ &quot; resource ."
that sense of the track is not in true life .
"when i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a <unk> : a <unk> call and <unk> idea , 20 pounds called <unk> ."
and i don &apos;t get this feedback in real places .
so the issues of <unk> such as world capital generation is that it &apos;s been blessed to be built at the time at one line of travel opportunity to start from all of the time that we usually spend our time on that seat .
they &apos;re just better than english .
"except now , all the world of <unk> people have spent millions of years in order to solve virtual problems of public scales ."
this is not necessarily bad .
it sounds like evil .
"but , to see this in the context , <unk> million years ago , our first job began to go down ."
so the first <unk> machine .
"ok , so if we &apos;re talking about how much time we spend with playing a lot of time , to do that just that to make sense of the time in terms of human development at the beginning of a <unk> conflict ."
"but there &apos;s that also . because it suggests that , by working all the time on play , actually , we &apos;re changing what &apos;s where people are ."
"we develop scales to robots , and we look at nature ."
that &apos;s the truth . i think it is .
"so at one point , now , if you look at that an interesting statistics that was published with <unk> university in <unk> : the average person of 30 people with <unk> for decades to consider <unk> of <unk> <unk> ."
"so , 10,000 hours is an interesting small number of two reasons ."
"first , so as kids in the u.s. , <unk> hours who spend in meaningful period that they spend time , from the high school through school until their near high school -- when you never got no gray ."
"so , here &apos;s a complete fan photo here , some <unk> <unk> when he &apos;s learning how to be a very good line , only with anything else she can learn from in school ."
and maybe some of them have hearing a new book millions of malcolm gladwell read .
so you know that original theory of <unk> that <unk> that <unk> for the kind of <unk> millions .
"it &apos;s based on the great research evidence that if we spend 10,000 hours with the electrical muscle , any <unk> , any way into the 21st <unk> is going to be <unk> that we are caught at producing <unk> ."
we &apos;re going to do so well with how the <unk> people have .
"well , what we &apos;ve got here is an entire first generation of young people that are <unk> ."
"so the big question is , what exactly are the player good at color ?"
because if we could figure out that we actually wouldn &apos;t have given the human own species .
"so , all so many people we now have in the world living in the world that &apos;s <unk> at least one hour of a day with <unk> ."
"these are our coverage team . 500 million people who are so good in , &quot; something dude ."
and we have a second billion group of next einstein who have heard of hiv in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it .
"the <unk> developed <unk> , <unk> energy , create <unk> , currently in the pitch , because it &apos;s with potential neurons on all the world , especially in india , china -- south math ."
and you expect an extra billion people in the next decade .
that &apos;s a third and a half billion <unk> .
"so i started to build this , and what it &apos;s like to do with other patients on the actual ."
here &apos;s the four things i found . the first thing : <unk> .
"ok , imagine the normal second idea , you imagine , again ."
"<unk> is this responding to speaking just something gets along , to solve a cause , with people that we have a safe hope on success ."
players always believe that a temporary victory is possible and it are absolutely more expensive to try and address it .
clouds are not sitting around .
<unk> are <unk> <unk> in <unk> as <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of more interesting lessons that we tell people something that &apos;s very much more like we play with .
the reason is that it needs a lot of trust with somebody to play with someone .
"and we have some faith that someone once has people to come out with us that the rules that we &apos;ve played the same goal to do it all over , and to the core to us ."
"so this <unk> <unk> allows different units of <unk> , faith and together ."
and having a consequence of making millions of social relationships .
<unk> <unk> : fantastic !
"you know , there &apos;s one reason why the <unk> of rock are 22 to 22 hours a week in a time in a little bit , as a significant proportion ."
"and the reason is that when we play , we are really <unk> working , when we leave ourselves or nothing ."
"we know that as human being <unk> when we go to real , <unk> , <unk> work ."
"and player are always ready to work hard , when they get the right to do ."
"and finally , very significant significance ."
happy love to build effective activity <unk> &apos;s work .
"here &apos;s an information that goes towards the side of the light . you will all know authenticity , mainly , first of the world in the world ."
"<unk> <unk> of the world , with almost <unk> -- is the world of <unk> ."
five million people use it every month .
"they have more information about world of <unk> that are <unk> across the internet , as to take the rest of themselves , in each other &apos;s world &apos;s face ."
they generate a personal story .
they create a larger source of knowledge about the world of liberal things .
"ok , so that &apos;s four music activists who are single automatically , got guys &apos; attitudes are <unk> individuals ."
we &apos;re people who believe they can change the world .
"and the only problem is believe , you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real story ."
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to try and solve .
edward <unk> is a lottery .
"it &apos;s a <unk> . you know , answer why people spend so high and energy on climate do it ."
"and he says , &quot; you &apos;re never going to pass less than windows into virtual worlds and engineering . &quot;"
"and this one player , now it &apos;s <unk> ."
and he &apos;s phone .
"not as magical as i -- i &apos;m making climbing , i engineer a little <unk> ."
"and so he &apos;s going to say , &quot; this is actually for that capability in zimbabwe just getting more than in the real life . &quot;"
"you can monitor powerful social tools that you can appear in the real life , it is <unk> more of life than start playing strings in real lives ."
"well , it &apos;s completely <unk> saying that players spend a time in physical background than on the real world ."
"i just get in even a <unk> , that &apos;s an explicit case ."
but it &apos;s definitely not an alien .
we need to begin to alter the world &apos;s real world .
my inspiration comes from a event that &apos;s <unk> years .
"there &apos;s this <unk> running , made out of <unk> . do you know ?"
"from those <unk> , there was <unk> ."
"and so , these were the first <unk> of the people of italy ."
"and if you &apos;re familiar with the ancient english frustrated by the old column , you may know this story , which is story about how and how competent play was invented ."
"as unlikely shows , games have been built , rather aware of the north crash mines during a <unk> ."
"he said there was such a great <unk> , the king of <unk> declared themselves to a crazy idea ."
people get existed . people offered <unk> .
it was a <unk> situation . it would take a <unk> answer .
"so they managed , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a very <unk> strategy , and then a dark disease , you would eat a day , a day you &apos;d play , all the day you &apos;re playing ."
"and they would be as so much the <unk> , since they &apos;re <unk> and , with our own progress , and <unk> , passing streams , that they would be forgotten , they wouldn &apos;t nutrition anymore ."
"and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat ."
"and <unk> researchers , they made this <unk> <unk> this , while they were <unk> right by a day , he knew a day and they were hitting the next ."
"in the same same way , i think we have games today ."
"we &apos;re <unk> <unk> , and things of suffering about the right world ."
"we use games to get realized especially working in the real world , in which real lives may , anything that is very shaped to the real lives , and we &apos;re going to be able to go to verify ."
but the way that real bill doesn &apos;t have to be .
this is <unk> .
"according to 18 years , <unk> , the <unk> did not was better , so the king decided , though in the last student , a white <unk> ."
they shared the kingdom in two <unk> .
they were playing an employee and were being white by getting wrong for the 19 nike hairs .
"they hit their <unk> , and they were taking some search for a new day , and they ended up making a lot of people so large , how they were looking for therapy at them , and the rest of a <unk> there , out ."
it sounds crazy . right ?
"but <unk> <unk> &apos;s concept that the <unk> <unk> , the fish coming together , that make the same dna as the old <unk> ."
"and so scientists recently came to thinking that <unk> is actually , frankly , that i did ."
"and <unk> found evidence of a global <unk> , which had almost 20 years , which would explain what the <unk> could explain ."
so this crazy story may be perfect .
"maybe they actually staff with their people by saved by <unk> <unk> for 18 years and then one of them <unk> , and they had been making it many more for with each other to do they are offered the whole civilization ."
so that we can do .
we &apos;ve been playing in <unk> since 1994 .
"that was the first train in real world of the english age of view , which was 16 years ago ."
"they had 70 years of labor survival , and they &apos;ve been playing at 16 years of <unk> ."
"so we &apos;re willing to say , all over our serious play ."
so they sent them half of their civilization to the search for a new world . so i think i assume that &apos;s where i would give my 21 billion <unk> per week .
"we &apos;re supposed to engage in food that half of us using an hour , by spending day , until we &apos;ve been solved the issues of the real world ."
"i know they &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do you do well problems of the real world ? &quot; and right in fact that i &apos;ve made my job a deal in the past few years to do this over that demo for the future ."
"we &apos;ve <unk> this where we basically get all more <unk> into an <unk> , say , &quot; how we should understand the future . &quot;"
we don &apos;t want to do it trying to tell the future earlier .
which we want to be able to create the future .
"we want to <unk> the best outcome , and then people have to kind of <unk> that sense of the reality ."
"we &apos;re <unk> effective judges , and give people opportunities to achieve them ."
and i &apos;ll just show you three games that i &apos;ve designed to try and inspire people to get a difference in their own future .
this is &quot; save a place of oil without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s a factory <unk> by understanding one story .
"the working problem is , but we &apos;ve <unk> enough <unk> to swim in it rather than it &apos;s not what their lives are , and when you do as they eat and hold , they never go from zealand , and you start working them ."
"we built this connect with <unk> during young 2007 , and we &apos;ve hanging it over here over the past three years ."
"and i can tell you , it was the change on it ."
"no one wants to change your life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we need to be ."
"but if you will have , if you &apos;re in the <unk> adventure , and we said , &quot; <unk> of oil . &quot;"
this is a <unk> adventure you are where we &apos;re .
"find what it would survive , and most of our little player have always set out to stick with each other games ."
"so we &apos;ve heard of the next <unk> game a greater objective , plus a way , to maintain the body ."
we have the playing carpet <unk> of <unk> <unk> for the future .
it &apos;s <unk> the computation of a story that people have only been 23 years on the planet .
"this artifact &apos;s the global protected price , of course ."
"the call of likes to link , the driver of flies , we &apos;ve changed as a &quot; <unk> &quot; made ."
"you &apos;ve been terrified the <unk> where you have the &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; you have the astronauts , the <unk> , the <unk> and the people can go save the world over ."
"but in our game , instead of just the short <unk> of people , we say you are in <unk> , and it &apos;s our purpose -- the future of energy , food , <unk> , american , health and the future of justice ."
"and in fact , 8,000 players were playing the game three weeks ."
they found enormously creative solutions that they can cause when they go ahead and send out &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and this last game that you <unk> away 3 . it &apos;s a play in collaboration with the world bank collaborate .
"if you connect the play , you can be <unk> by the world world bank <unk> <unk> of social relativity ."
"we are working with universities all this effort and dunes , trying to learn in <unk> social <unk> ."
"we have an equivalent of it . we &apos;ve got <unk> implications for health <unk> , to explore sustainability , vision , vision , vision and child vision ."
"i &apos;d like to invite you all to share that play with young people , all across the world , especially in all in the ways that benefit each other , themselves , are an <unk> supporting our own social social systems ."
i come for a couple of things .
i want to ask you a good question .
what do you believe next ?
"we have all these most <unk> players , we have games that show to us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t invested the real world yet ."
and i hope that i hope you for being that player is best human resources that we can put a life to be in real lives and that games have a great advantage for change .
"we have all this <unk> , <unk> , to allow the ability to <unk> <unk> social <unk> , <unk> , and to think about &quot; meaning to purpose . &quot;"
and i really hope that we play strong games to keep on this planet an next century .
and i hope they &apos;re going to have these things to play and play .
"when i start growing in next decade , i &apos;m sure that we can create each more iranian hope and that we can play the whole lot of play ."
"so i say , first successfully test the <unk> ."
thank you .
i would like to tell you what i &apos;ve seen a couple of months ago when writing existed an article in wired cave .
"i &apos;ve always been in writing with my <unk> , but i &apos;ve been done with the <unk> <unk> , and i grew out of see that i had never been in my lifetime , which is &quot; dirty &quot; called &quot; really what the word &quot; acronym . &quot;"
and i &apos;m reading the vagina .
"now , deceased , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , um , motivated , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> feedback , out possible figure , dancing , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , breeding , boom , t , through the soft , laser <unk> ."
"<unk> : healthy , strong , commercial ."
"i read this list of love a friend <unk> , and i had to laugh at them , he <unk> that way , but i was just out until , and i couldn &apos;t read even less about <unk> and read me <unk> after that emotional <unk> and so much <unk> for that shock ."
"<unk> , of course , that was a <unk> , very <unk> <unk> -- i just thought it was a poem that must be quite old ."
"but actually , it was a series in the early &apos; 70s , than i was growing at first , started making my elite <unk> outside space and also was actually doing to the other and to the <unk> ."
"and god , why would i have used pants in the day ."
"if i go into that seriously if i was born into a world that could see somebody as a person <unk> being a changed in a <unk> way , but today , i &apos;ll have a inspired for the opportunity i was lost for adventure ."
"so i immediately <unk> the sales of 2009 , and i expected that i found an ad system over here ."
here &apos;s the business version of this .
glamorous feeling is not much better .
"specifically , the last two words , including <unk> <unk> , go through &quot; and <unk> ."
but it &apos;s not just about just words .
it &apos;s what we think about people that we describe to it with those <unk> .
"it &apos;s about the values which are in these words , and how we engineer these values ."
our language impact our change and how we think the world and the people around us &apos;re seeing on .
"a lot of critically estimated that , underwater <unk> and the early judgments , and <unk> also did that the conservation region that its own force has a big force , because what they &apos;ve been <unk> to , including is <unk> too ."
"so , so what we &apos;re actually proposing -- an <unk> human man or a nice man ?"
we could just have people describe <unk> <unk> as a child might <unk> to be surprised to see them and show them <unk> ideas .
would it not be nice to open buildings out ?
one person who opened up in the doors to me was my article of <unk> grades <unk> in <unk> .
"he &apos;s a <unk> , author in a <unk> , whose name could think about it was most optimistic a number of americans couldn &apos;t act . so it became writer to dr. <unk> ."
"and uganda had an outbreak constantly painted , and was just about the work of children just like creating ."
"and i found the time i spent time in that hospital just just kind of -- to hiding out , until my ring ."
"i had to have some symmetrical <unk> , easily , <unk> with those <unk> , <unk> -- on different colors -- they know those <unk> , home shape , and i &apos;ve got more <unk> than anything , i paid them <unk> ."
"and imagine that , here a while i &apos;ve even had an act of a children with dr. <unk> speaking , and then tried to stop these types of drugs without success ."
"and he came over the day of a kid , where i had watched me -- these were just <unk> and <unk> , and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so an <unk> and young girls , and they are becoming a 20 ."
"and if you leave it off , i give you a hundred bucks . &quot;"
"and obviously this was just a simple trick by dr. <unk> , that i &apos;m not trying to do with a prospect of leaving 10 / a second girl at the <unk> of the second one , but in fact , from 1968 , and a healthy mom to do that , he <unk> me , in fact ,"
"and i &apos;m now wondering , how hard it &apos;s inspired by me as <unk> and <unk> young children , i &apos;ve provided my <unk> and can imagine me to look as one of nature of foster sense and <unk> <unk> ."
this is just an example of a number of fashion example as as adult teaching the model of a child .
"but just like the most fundamental examples of physical <unk> , let us prove our language is not possible to imagine something we all wish : to allow each one to take point -- be able to see it <unk> people as maybe as a population ."
our language collapsed all over the social changes that happened into a <unk> is consumed by actually a technological change .
"you can see our organization from expression , of course <unk> that my legs got north , reduces from titan and <unk> lasted for <unk> percent on body -- and maybe in fact , inspire them to people and forth the limitations that allows you to deliver hidden and the emphasis upon the center on the patient engagement ."
"and maybe the <unk> of the technological change used that there are more flourishing that with the other truth , that every person can give something entirely kind of deeper and very compact , and that human ability should attack our great power , our largest skill system ."
"and the human ability to <unk> -- this is an interesting story , because people always keep me asking if i serve with technical <unk> and i &apos;m scared to tell you : and i never really surprised to do , and i often feel , so i &apos;ve always learn better and have a distinguished people so common"
"this piece of tuning lives with <unk> &apos;s potter , that success depends on , or happiness are based missing more reflective , without having a increase in <unk> experience , as if my life still enters me as physically started with a wire i could form as saved or as a dolphin ."
"but the truth is that we change ourselves . of course we &apos;ve been creating that matters by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , or even both <unk> or at both ."
and i claim that this is good .
"you &apos;re not one very <unk> , that we &apos;re supposed to be able to get away with our life better ."
technology &apos;s just in labor .
and me gains the fishermen as a shadow of this .
"sometimes i hear that he &apos;s a very <unk> about reading , sometimes he &apos;s not in a portion , but it &apos;s always for me all ."
"and so i want to look at it with an impact , the difficult effect of <unk> of an adult ."
"there are <unk> , creation and the challenges that are only longer real and each person is there in different ways -- but the question is not about when we &apos;re <unk> real or not , but we &apos;re where we get to everything ."
"so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people that we love to keep worried about <unk> , but they &apos;re also trying to get them out well ."
and we don &apos;t seem to give up their children if we feel like they can &apos;t help out it .
"the place is that they have to throw on two things feedback : to the medical organization , to be more selfish , and to the other guys , the mathematics in which is , i &apos;m intellectual , not ."
and to be honest with that the only mate and first <unk> with whom i had to be put through is that the world always feels that we can possibly describe it with these complications .
"in our desire to protect people who are at the heart , and about the <unk> truth about their early <unk> philosophy or even a prediction of life for the future they expect to be unpredictable of normal , in fact , that we don &apos;t work on vision ."
"maybe , the very standard concept which is only just to be completely <unk> with what is carried on in a <unk> , and how we built it , for each individual <unk> to its own strategy , that can still be different in their ."
"if we use people not stressed out , and not seem to look aware of all its forces and opportunity , and the evidence is for which it <unk> in the shadow you might have to have to lead to more disease ."
we invent a human one that is worth for our society .
"we also have to look like beyond the anywhere , and focus to everyone &apos;s area of human behavior ."
the <unk> <unk> is that the attention between our our biological and our great one comes with new method <unk> .
"we should not <unk> this primate so difficult thing or <unk> , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid , yet all be <unk> , we should recognize it under those americans , but it turns out to actually notice that in a scale of growth ."
"but i &apos;m about , perhaps too clear to , that we don &apos;t have to solve <unk> , but that we &apos;re <unk> to be about to put them on the operating system for even to get a biological package and perhaps even 20 ."
"and maybe we can see where you make those , <unk> as a <unk> , some valuable and make that so animals don &apos;t make us feel so much <unk> ."
"so during this year we celebrate the 200 <unk> <unk> of charles darwin and to give him 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , in my eyes , has sort of pretty much in what makes of human peers ."
"i would lack it : no an <unk> , not the most <unk> of its way , and <unk> not the way of her , but the one &apos;s the way to adapt the most <unk> ."
from conflicts of creativity .
"not just by darwin &apos;s images that us understand that the ability of spirit to survive and to survive , by the fight of human power is <unk> by conflict ."
"so again , changing , business <unk> . everybody is the <unk> capabilities of people ."
"and we might think , from any things we actually investigate would , when we were really published ."
"in fact , this is the meaning of <unk> -- is a perception of the world &apos;s mind , an sense of our own power ."
we can give them one time .
we can give a new meaning for the light that goes far beyond .
we might actually see substantial as change .
"it is very limited for value , whether we haven &apos;t even previously left ."
i think we have the biggest damage we &apos;ve ever gained with ourselves is that we want to be normal .
even -- whose is the normal latin ?
there &apos;s no normal standard .
"there are automobiles . the usual . but not the normal thing . and , you &apos;d know this poor person , get really learned how much -- you &apos;d really want to know that <unk> ?"
i think that way that &apos;s not .
"and it would be amazing if we are discussing that challenges in service by the brain , the pleasure that we could even become more dangerous to be , from different people , so we can <unk> the forces of very often have and improve their applications and her planning ."
now <unk> found out that we do have people living amongst our engineers in human society : to be valuable and to make them .
"there &apos;s evidence that which past been over 60,000 countries of older people and people with severe dollars from physical being with using heavy habitats and that may be when 20th mortality was called in the <unk> , to life that for the concussion was productive ."
"you have missing these people as not it . they heidi , they were used as special and <unk> ."
"a couple of years ago i was growing up at the city , where i grew up in a <unk> center in this &quot; <unk> islands &quot; in the silicon city , and i &apos;m sitting there before a a private tables ."
it was summer and i had failed .
"and i hear what the guy says behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee <unk> . &quot;"
"and i started myself and i &apos;m watching this older man , i didn &apos;t know who he was ."
"and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , do we know ? i can &apos;t remind you . &quot;"
"and he said , &quot; well , you have been hardly remember me ."
"but when i first saw her her , i <unk> her out of her mother &apos;s mother . &quot;"
"oh , that ."
and of course it did expect .
"so , someone &apos;s <unk> , a man i had of seen my mother , if i had a result for this day , because , of course , i was the opposite of jewish weeks to leave ."
"so the doctor is at <unk> my mother &apos;s office involvement in breakfast , and the parents used to get the majority to me , not at the world at all ."
"and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet , <unk> to <unk> , and i only sat a pair of toes on this one and one table on a <unk> <unk> , he had to <unk> that <unk> that <unk> the bad news ."
"he said to me , &quot; i needed to tell your parents , that you would never walk like any failure and anybody could never be alive or having you could never have an independent life , and then have any war on you ever . &quot;"
"what i found is that he <unk> my whole marriage to do , have no matter whether i may have offered in the second <unk> experiment that i could run off the <unk> by shekhar jerusalem in , wearing no matter , and the doctor , i couldn &apos;t wear by my flutes and my &apos; <unk> ."
and he called his part of the value of that testimony that the potential of human career .
so you can &apos;t realize enough ways how statistics it can be for the choice of life ?
"and the educate told his little premise , he said , &quot; i learned that children with what she does not get himself whenever they get , even got a little bit support if they were able to get kids and kids , they can make a lot ."
"see , dr. <unk> has changed and changed ."
"he understood that the medical diagnosis , and as somebody being <unk> and a different idea would have two different things ."
"and even though i &apos;m thinking all over the time had happening if you went to the age of 15 years old , if i gave my golf advice against legs from little sections and distance , i should have no beginnings in time ."
so i wanted to indeed make physical affect .
"if you ask me questions this today , i &apos;m not much sure ."
and this happens because i <unk> about my legs and not <unk> even of these <unk> .
"and maybe this change could also happen , because i feel so many people who opened doors to me , instead of having people who have me , or to experience a notion of situations ."
"you can see , it takes one single humans to give you the <unk> of how that they do what they will <unk> , and is with them ."
"if you allow someone to <unk> their own , the human , your spirit , is so <unk> -- if you make this together , to create somebody in a crucial moment , you sit and open up those folks are really good leaders ."
they get to open their lego .
but the real importance of accountability &quot; <unk> into the word &quot; confidence . &quot;
"it means that something has a contribution , into one , this <unk> , the potential ."
"again , what potential explains , because all we want <unk> ?"
"in the 1940s , the last friday meant where <unk> were conducted in britain . in <unk> were transformed in <unk> ."
"they call it the &quot; china <unk> , &quot; we are calling what he &apos;s called &quot; central winter . &quot;"
the students will face according to grade .
"and a developer will get tougher <unk> tests , get the better teachers , etc . please ."
"you &apos;ve come up with an <unk> <unk> period with <unk> hours of all very <unk> called &quot; very good <unk> , &quot; you &apos;d say she was a very smart , and you had a really laugh for those three months where you worked ."
"and of course , you know , you know , that you got the heart that you know is <unk> , you know they &apos;re only improvements ."
and it &apos;s equally as well after the three months .
but they were all the ones who were still in school -- the directions of students who had come up with school .
that critical one in some point was that teachers were not agile .
the teachers didn &apos;t know something was <unk> .
"they were simply saying that say recover the grades and they are the students willing , for the note , and they were taught by giving them and they &apos;re teaching them ."
"the only real <unk> is a little conscious mind that was broken , was that has no hope . he &apos;s have no chance of <unk> of <unk> our natural judgments , integrated our ability to use our appearance and our ability to work ."
"if we create it , to support the human mind in the process of creating it , to keep aside , <unk> around himself , and <unk> , what are the <unk> are saying that we can truly be mystery <unk> our forces ."
"when a mind is based on these qualities , we can create a new thing and new movement ."
"i would like to finish by a poem called <unk> <unk> <unk> , and told me about my friend <unk> <unk> and which was <unk> . and the god says &quot; my god &quot; explaining men , &quot; a perfectly little word &quot; poor . &quot; em corpus them . &quot;"
"come , dance with me . thank you very much ."
how do you want to be better when you &apos;re there at currently ?
"suppose i said that by very few changes of your genes might have a better memory -- increases in part , and a chemical and <unk> complex ."
or they want to feel <unk> and as more force .
you want to get suicide and <unk> ?
how would it . to live in good health ?
or maybe they &apos;ve had one of those who are always more by giving your creativity now .
which one that would come closely ?
what would you like to have if they could have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose to pick creativity ?
raise your hands . let me go .
some hits . probably something like that we have creative people here .
so that &apos;s very good .
how many would be their aim target for a good memory ?
games more .
so what about the <unk> ?
a couple less .
what about longevity ?
"ah , the majority . the baby kingdom i like for a doctor ."
"if you could just share one of them , it &apos;d be something new parts human ."
is this all <unk> ?
or is it possible ?
"evolution is an inverted there was a <unk> story here on <unk> hair , but what i &apos;d like to get to you today &apos;s perspective on a context ."
"the great <unk> of london , civil <unk> , <unk> who was also a well-known apartment to the russian church department of some <unk> , one paper writing wrong with no sense in biology was in the <unk> of evolution ."
"now , if you &apos;re one of those of these , who don &apos;t accept proof of evolution , that would be a very good point at the time of that point they &apos;re making their individual record -- i &apos;m going to tell you the prediction for what on there , tell you would give it then you"
"but if you accept evolution , do this , remember it the only over your past , is it only about the future , or is it also about the future ?"
is it <unk> for other <unk> or is it to us ?
and so this is another vision from life .
"in this image , i made a <unk> for a middle of the herd in everything elsewhere , because if you look at the space of life on his <unk> , all the <unk> was <unk> to the links : they had gone to clean ; she had success ."
"and as human movement for this <unk> , far on , of course , that &apos;s what we &apos;re most interested in is ."
we left from a shared shared dreams of modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
"on this slide , maybe 20 to three <unk> of hydrocarbons ."
there have been some of them and started .
we &apos;ve been here for over 300 years .
"it seems , as if we are given to the other parts of the land of life , but truly for one thing , the essential <unk> of our cells are very sane in ."
"is that we can <unk> out this , and it gives us the maximum leverage of a dinosaur structure to produce the protein of human testing , which uses to treat organ cells ?"
"this is not like quantum bars , and this is the same protein that is the radiation <unk> of what is coming from from the phone <unk> ."
and what we &apos;ve been talking about bacteria is that each one of us in our <unk> are more galaxies than we have had one possible answer ?
maybe 10 times <unk> .
"i mean , think when arthur <unk> , when on your <unk> teacher is <unk> , do you think about the bacteria ?"
our <unk> is a wonderful moving environment for these bacteria .
"it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s so much <unk> , it &apos;s very safe ."
and you &apos;re going to all of them and <unk> to give them just a wish that could only offer -- without power efforts .
"it &apos;s really an extraordinary way to anticipate data from any <unk> , by which calculations , to attract <unk> ."
"but what else you &apos;re what you &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , in equally as important in her life ."
"they help from the animals leading from the <unk> , and they protect them against a building of situations ."
but what is going to come from the future ?
"are we in a <unk> , kind of emerging in forms of a species ?"
or are we that can become something else -- something that might even <unk> to the environment ?
"so , let &apos;s take you a step back in the dawn of 14 years ago -- the stream , earth , just about a november billion years ago -- perhaps to three of information viruses , three and a few years away from the planet , the first experiments on the world , after the entire current species"
"in this huge astonishing symphony of the universe , this is the life on earth only , very short , <unk> ; animal as a single sheet of bone , and of the human life , a small <unk> of life , a tiny teeth ."
that &apos;s where we were .
"here &apos;s the <unk> of that talk , which is why i hope to charity , d <unk> them ."
"now when i was a <unk> to college , i had my first <unk> ."
i was fascinated by the but beauty and the biology of biology .
"i come up into the strength of evolution , and i myself introduced something that is very <unk> : most of all life alive in dramatic organisms , each cell , and all the genetic cell is <unk> in the pack of the cell ."
"but at time as <unk> organisms collapsed as people approached democracies , they began to change things ."
your sexual <unk> evolves .
"and the third of the <unk> of the <unk> gene , which is followed by the <unk> , the entire genome will define it <unk> ."
"and in fact , you could say that the capital of the <unk> of our body in the same pace , the function of its sexual brain is much like sexual <unk> ."
"now i have to say , as i was a <unk> , i thought , you know , sex / per person -- dying from sex -- it was quite anonymous to the moment in which is a decade old one can be <unk> my beings up ."
"i came up with understanding the feelings of george <unk> , who <unk> his show in the &apos; <unk> could stop picture in the 90s ."
"and one night , there is a <unk> of his <unk> ."
he opens the door .
tell him there &apos;s a gorgeous <unk> <unk> .
"and she looked at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;"
"&quot; that &apos;s a wonderful &quot; to say george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take soup . &quot;"
"i <unk> it as a way that i first resolved that i was as the power of evolution -- not staggering and human act , very different way ."
i &apos;ve tried to preserve the body .
i &apos;d be kid for free .
i wanted to raise health for one disease .
i was trying to make a long and artificial life .
"evolution is all over the genome of the next generation , <unk> and survival generation ."
"they &apos;re making up as a remarkable standpoint , they exhibit me , and i like lifelike <unk> to send the genetic division into the next to house , to send each other ."
"i think we &apos;d all hacked <unk> , everyone &apos;s <unk> , and he &apos;d understand as my name , &quot; i don &apos;t want to join my work ."
i don &apos;t want to get it by driving . &quot;
evolution is not about getting any planet &apos;s state of living .
"and it doesn &apos;t grow the largest biggest , the <unk> , or the fastest and the <unk> , and not even the <unk> of the <unk> ."
evolution is how creatures interact that is at best of its environmental .
it &apos;s the very energy that &apos;s or experiments is about supply .
"the bottom of the ocean &apos;s bacteria have fallen into the <unk> , and by putting out the <unk> potato -- if fish were there , it would have kind of fish <unk> that actually set them out there to make a <unk> environment ."
"so what if we looked back around what can we get back in evolution , as we think about how did place that human capacity to be <unk> and count everywhere , particularly as we go back into the level i would tell that you do ."
the first one is that we won &apos;t win .
we have done a series of <unk> .
"and the reasons for it was for us to have come back from medicine , there &apos;s been a whole bunch of genes that would be saved and would have been removed from the population ."
"and then we , as a species , we <unk> our environment so we &apos;ve done it to <unk> , and we &apos;re able to adapt to you as in , to so we actually apply those of them ."
"and by the way , we <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> anymore have gotten no idea that <unk> is needed to go ahead from evolution to <unk> ."
"a second way to be that it &apos;s a evolution of traditional species , of course , by the state of nature of nature ."
"and that argument , here would be that the wings of <unk> the circuit is it slower , but they &apos;re growing ."
"and the <unk> trade place where if we were a species as a wide planet , <unk> and how the changes could be genetically <unk> , it could produce shift evolution in the natural way ."
"but there &apos;s a third way to <unk> something , amazing and remarkable possibilities ."
"so , i call it <unk> -- the new development that is not just sort of all its trends , but kept behind us as the personal beings we make ."
"well , how could that happen ?"
so how can we be able to do this ?
what we do now is take view by where people are in spending cultures are doing decisions about their fictional jobs .
"they are , in some <unk> , the election , to have more men as women ."
"it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it is what the individual and the family will decide ."
so think about when it couldn &apos;t only do that of their child &apos;s younger individual but also <unk> under the atmosphere that makes a <unk> for disease and neurologic disease .
"what if you could make genetic changes that information could cause diabetes , or &quot; prevent diabetes , the <unk> control of <unk> ? &quot;"
"if you don &apos;t want to do this , are you going to make these changes in your genes ?"
"if we start being <unk> , we &apos;ll have a result of bigger changes ."
the genome genome students project <unk> at year and it &apos;s been 13 years .
it cost billions billion dollars .
"what i &apos;ve done in 2004 that it was finished in 2004 , you could do the same for 20 million dollars a few months before they &apos;re doing this every story ."
"now , you can sequence an sequence of the three billion shelves of the human genome to a top 15 to an average and in the domain of about a week ."
"it &apos;s never going to take for more progress , so the reality is there will be 1,000 dollars &apos;s language in each other worth , and it &apos;s increasingly becoming <unk> ."
"a week ago , national science festival that was written the national academy industry institute in jewish islands for francis <unk> and closer to the <unk> species that <unk> the natural process of the evolution to lead <unk> and making values in its organ into a <unk> tool ."
"a couple years ago , <unk> was killing the scientist &apos;s research surgeon to be some <unk> in whose research could lead a disorder and looking through the selection of only just four genes that cell would be off a specific difference in it <unk> tumor ."
these changes are there .
the same technology that &apos;s can produce human insulin in bacteria that can control material that can &apos;t protection itself but also sequence by it to other people &apos;s aid .
"whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s a <unk> research <unk> be happening on vaccine by vaccine to be measured by the cells that have been fed in the stem cell ever ."
can you imagine a bit which comes from the theater ?
"this is all understanding -- that &apos;s in the future , and they get so much more ."
now imagine things that are only two different changes .
"and you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of their <unk> ?"
"what if you could change that toes and <unk> or the <unk> adult free <unk> to engage your children a better chance of a serious competitive opportunity -- <unk> the diabetes , do the risk of cancer cells ?"
"who , who wants to <unk> kids ?"
"and then in the process , the same platform , the dynamics , the science of production the possible possible makes to make the changes possible , could allow us to <unk> vacuum <unk> , <unk> -- <unk> reality , which make better memory of memory ."
"why do you don &apos;t have the health tower of an <unk> process of an art clinical story , in europe , when you can slow down it to the next generation of <unk> ?"
why didn &apos;t the fast go into <unk> that allow them to be taken faster and longer to run ?
why not live longer ?
they &apos;re being mixed .
"and if we &apos;re in the position where we can communicate to the next generation and eventually disruptive , because we think of the advantages that we will become <unk> by mental evolution ."
"we &apos;re going to have a process that actually costs about 100,000 years , and we can come to people on academic and , and perhaps even 40 years , on 100 years ."
these are decisions where your grandchildren will or your grandchildren are to go through .
"does these choices take a sense of money that &apos;s better , the basic thing , the more <unk> ?"
or will we enable different detection <unk> of manufacturing history we want to use for some of us and not for others from us ?
"will we bring you a society into <unk> and enable information , or <unk> and communications ?"
these are the kinds of questions that we need to be upon .
"and at the assumption of all , should we be able to have the wisdom , the wisdom , the wisdom that we need , in the way , to make those decisions ?"
"we have good as in evil , and once we often think about , these decisions will be viable ."
thank you .
"i want you to imagine a bit along with a self-organizing robot , which <unk> advantage you to get aside or another one that helps up when you walk , to get up ."
we called <unk> <unk> these robots .
"they &apos;re nothing different than each one who pulls it back in the morning and <unk> them as one , and that will increase their speed and help them vote , for example ."
so this is actually the true injustice of the human and machine .
but not just that -- <unk> so that and combine them with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just an intelligent idea .
"to show them what we are now , we &apos;re going to start by hearing about the american soldiers who are wearing 125 <unk> about per rainforest , and it &apos;s sort of the one that needs to carry access them ."
"of course , this leads to some major trends -- money , 50 percent of that -- key bonds production speed ."
"so , we thought we &apos;d run through the challenge , and we &apos;d make some media work that &apos;s going to help use it with problem ."
so let me introduce you to right now -- or the foreign underlying universal phenomenon .
"<unk> : with the computer <unk> , i can wear 20,000 pounds over sea screen , a bit for hours ."
"his colleague <unk> design makes it <unk> , preparing to be extremely smart , and highly powerful transition ."
it feels what i want to go to where i want and further drop my strength and <unk> .
"we are the fashion power processes we view here , in the next part of this pipeline , a free segment of ."
so it &apos;s true .
"let &apos;s go and get a look at the <unk> , something that i try to do with particularly brilliantly ."
there are <unk> million people who are given in the world are sitting there .
it &apos;s about a percent percent <unk> .
and this is actually an <unk> probability .
"we often talk about very young people , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> who were designed <unk> for her real lifetime -- <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> being made from , the wheelchair is the only option ."
"but it also politics have been different from the population , where they happen to have to be suspended ."
and so pretty much the only one option -- if this &apos;ll go about the <unk> and go with a <unk> plus it &apos;s a wheelchair .
"and so we &apos;ve been to say , for 500 years , since i must say , really , very strange ."
so we thought that we could begin to write a whole new tune in the area of mobility .
"so let me imagine that we &apos;ve been <unk> by <unk> , which held by the <unk> <unk> that collapsed typically 19 years ago doesn &apos;t have <unk> to do much more than 19 year and now ."
thank you .
"i said , <unk> actually <unk> our <unk> ."
it has sensors .
"their completely mysterious sensors on the <unk> , the left traffic <unk> of our backs along here was in your back here ."
"and here are <unk> , the stream is kept on their signature , and as these are <unk> into their new transactions , they move out in those quite <unk> and very far natural ."
"i was a child and <unk> after 12 , when a <unk> <unk> <unk> lifted me ."
"when i have a second , i lost every lens and a practice below my <unk> ."
"not for that long afterwards to you design a doctor , and he says , &quot; huh , you never be able to go again . &quot;"
and that was about 19 years ago .
he <unk> the opportunity that they make <unk> by my consciousness .
"<unk> technologies have <unk> me since then to start <unk> <unk> , to come back and even present with my hands ."
"but nothing was invented , it would way back until now ."
thank you .
"as you can see , we have the technology , we have the <unk> to meet these platforms and to hopefully discuss with you ."
"and in our hands is kong , and we have the whole potential to change life now -- not only for farmers , and for america who are large-scale issues here , but all right after you ."
thank you .
"now at house in new york , i am an <unk> <unk> by an <unk> organization called <unk> ."
"if i don &apos;t go to the poverty depression , i used as a <unk> during a team for a people , who had stone dinner ."
"well , in our town , in volunteers , <unk> out of their civil society , you &apos;ve got to be quite early on ."
and i remember my first fire .
"i was the second one of malaria employees , i had , so i was going to have good opportunity to think in there ."
but it &apos;s still an exploration <unk> to the other volunteers in order to <unk> <unk> and to figure out what our task would be .
"and then when i saw the <unk> , he had in a very safe conversation with the <unk> <unk> <unk> who had been one of their life in the matter of their lives ."
"it was in the middle of the night , and she was standing under the watch and grandma wear out under a plane floating out there , and brian in the front line , while the house was going to be acting ."
the other volunteers that was <unk> to me just ago -- we call this <unk> of martin wars -- <unk> the <unk> as a were first to be asked to go to the house of saving .
the dog ! i was just <unk> niger .
"and it was a nine-year-old or a lawyer , and the welfare of all this lifespan that people could say that he was going to spend in a <unk> house and saving a whole living , because it was five seconds than i was ."
"well , i became the next ."
my business job gave me to yourself .
"he said , &quot; oh , you gotta go into the house ."
"you need to go back , go to the fire and this woman needs a couple of shoes . &quot;"
i work .
"now , not exactly what i was eating , but i was walking along top the talks on the christ , the &quot; real &quot; <unk> over that time that had been <unk> . 60,000 be just by saying a <unk> <unk> so kitchen in <unk> ."
"i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero ."
i had my pursuit back to staying ; i &apos;ve heard the boat in love that trash and her passage .
"we <unk> our <unk> who &apos;s broken out for fire as <unk> , not to become a lot of attention , and history was more and more difficult ."
"a bunch of weeks later , the cabin family received one letter by getting what they do for , the cd of 100,000 minutes ."
one thing about particularly <unk> <unk> for arrows : somebody even had given their shoes .
"by bringing them in my job as clients and , i studied to be <unk> and <unk> generosity and <unk> of kindness and really , but i also see the structural thing was <unk> and <unk> of <unk> ."
and you know what i &apos;ve learned .
you &apos;re all big .
"so if i &apos;ve seen transforming explore in this room , and this is that even as well people who will have completely done an enormous successful success , or their way there i want to come to avoid commercial thing : don &apos;t wait ."
"just don &apos;t wait for you to make a difference in your life from another , until they reached your range , for one ."
"if to give you something , give them some ."
"let &apos;s take an <unk> in it , advertising , with a park in the neighborhood ."
are some .
"not every day we &apos;ll give a chance of saving life to anybody else , but every day is an opportunity to change it ."
so they put them on ; they save their shoes .
thank you .
"<unk> <unk> : mark , mark , come back ."
thank you .
i just come back from a community that is knows about the secret of humankind .
"a site where women lead the public , with sex , &apos; hello , and the game <unk> -- which is too bad for the heart ."
"and no , it &apos;s not <unk> you or san francisco ."
"ladies and gentlemen , their cave trips ."
this is the world &apos;s most <unk> <unk> state in the congo countryside .
"we have <unk> , with chimpanzees , our next living ."
"that means we have a common biology , an evolutionary secret that lived for about six million years ago ."
"well , chimpanzees are known to populations of its sight ."
"but unfortunately , we created this aspect of the creation of human evolution ."
but let &apos;s show the other side of the <unk> .
"while chimps are <unk> by big , <unk> independent cheval seals , the <unk> will run by military female ."
"they were really <unk> with which , because that leads to a <unk> society in the <unk> force that existed not yet ."
"but unfortunately in <unk> , most of the <unk> is to be well-known among primate ."
"they live in the deep ocean security , and they &apos;re just very difficult for <unk> ."
"the congo is an afghan -- a land of amazing biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the nervous <unk> of personal <unk> of a much exchange that have increased for decades and nearly as many societies as the first world war also ."
it won &apos;t surprise that these crowds also inhabit the survival of the <unk> at the scale .
and <unk> and the <unk> experience of the <unk> and stops <unk> that already there could hit a driving defense station with one time -- and even even i think we were not safe to be honest .
"so , in this country of violence and chaos you can listen to emotion that drives trees ."
know who are these cute ?
"we know dramatic as right as for war , because they have had <unk> , <unk> sex with sex , and <unk> levels and rules that they require social and question ."
"i said yes , not those things all ought to be issues to all the problems -- that the life of <unk> has been more than the end building ."
"<unk> -- as we thankfully , you know how to play life long ."
play is not just replacement tales .
"so for us , it is fundamentally universal for the <unk> of relationships , and the radio spirit of the tolerance ."
and all of our learning and trust of the game .
"play generates <unk> and <unk> , and it is especially about diversity of resilience -- diversity from diversity , diversity , diversity of forms , diversity ."
"and when you see a dinosaur <unk> , you see a functional <unk> of human <unk> and deception and <unk> of it ."
game is the speaker of literacy that we relate to .
"now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to share a few unique 10,000 footage from the wild ."
first a <unk> table -- -- and i don &apos;t think i <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
"so , here we can see an <unk> females , and males in a <unk> ."
look at what it does .
and that might be the evolutionary <unk> to be called &quot; she allows him to listen to the whale this . &quot;
"well i think it is rather like this , not true , i think ."
yeah .
"so food has been spread , both <unk> and people in terms ."
"and this video is really interesting , because it shows this video , and this clip is actually interesting , because the engine shows how to put new elements into the game -- and how basic theory may believe co as well as respect ."
but the game is huge high .
"game is a <unk> , and it can have a huge amount of shape that will be some of them report , study and curious -- and maybe to discover what helps to discover the process again ."
"and i want to show you , that &apos;s a to break , a females , and she &apos;s playing with water <unk> ."
"and i think right , as they &apos;ve just been playing out , and we &apos;re <unk> limit out of our <unk> and across south worlds ."
"and it &apos;s as inspired as <unk> demonstrates us , i abstract us , and the <unk> thing that we go into is the real sense of creativity ."
this is just a smaller example of a insight that <unk> us into our past and present .
"but they also have a secret for our future , a future that we have to adapt to : to <unk> of different policy and <unk> programs ."
the secret is a game that the key to these capabilities is the key .
"in other words , game <unk> our character ."
"in order to pursue successful <unk> world , we need to play ."
but are the best thing we &apos;re going to do of our <unk> minds ?
play is not learning .
so proper .
for <unk> and humans also have yet life in the milk and yet intensive care alone .
"actually if it &apos;s only poor , maybe the game is very simple ."
"and so in my mind , let &apos;s turn this gift of evolution and <unk> , as we can attach creativity the genes , and <unk> it ."
thank you .
"and i wanted you to imagine that you &apos;ve got two <unk> , middle , that same same day , two same getting yourself , every woman <unk> -- ok ."
"so two <unk> , every single <unk> of one ."
"now i don &apos;t urge you to do an eye-opening time to imagine the connectivity again because when you &apos;re imagining the whole random thing , you &apos;re not going to listen to me ."
"remember , for some instant , only if you did it , too ?"
"and in this scenario , they imagine that that this <unk> wore an y <unk> <unk> cancer , which <unk> towards the x prize <unk> ."
"and in the other case , the genocide is <unk> for a x prize , which <unk> after the <unk> prize ."
"both sides are <unk> , both <unk> ."
we &apos;ll go back back to these people .
"when most of my <unk> , i got two brothers on a <unk> ."
<unk> among a half <unk> -- i asked myself to the story of western view .
"i &apos;m school colleagues , <unk> and within this case i thought kind of like with <unk> <unk> -- is that normal body , body -- just like you &apos;ve <unk> , with <unk> , with flight <unk> , they thought about body size ."
"the other studies i run in my work is the oil industry , as a way , as a <unk> <unk> -- as sometimes i say , as a customer , the patients are <unk> from <unk> <unk> ."
"in this case , i worked with people who have <unk> , providing the social behaviors that are happening ."
"so , i worked with people , working <unk> and creating two people , and in two <unk> ."
i &apos;ve been working with people with risk density -- so people who were shorter than common .
"and very often , i worked with military people whose links &apos;s <unk> , so people , for the average age of female companies , are <unk> <unk> ."
"and as a general term , we can use this word <unk> ."
<unk> comes in lots and different shapes .
"i just give you a couple of examples of <unk> <unk> that do not access to 3,000 or young <unk> ."
"you may have <unk> with a different letter , maybe your price of the hormone gene , and the gestures waited the emotion that we have dedicated levels of stanford ."
and that &apos;s why <unk> is conducted the <unk> level of 93 .
"but , since that individual <unk> <unk> to decide the testosterone , the testosterone didn &apos;t react to that replaced ."
and that &apos;s called an entire example .
"so much testosterone , but not in response ."
"as a result , the body rises <unk> higher female principle ."
"when the baby is born , they look like a girl ."
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought out . she &apos;s just a girl .
"but it seems given other just to have to have the <unk> growth and its intervention <unk> and develop , but they &apos;re not <unk> , before someone in it , for anyone to be different , that you have something else ."
"and they take a bunch of tests and out , that instead of terminal and <unk> , where they &apos;re in fact called , in fact , in a <unk> that they put in y <unk> ."
"there is important to understand that you could actually keep this person , you know , and they &apos;re not really ."
"women , like men , have the difference in our body , call out happiness ."
you &apos;re in the diego part of county .
and the <unk> places that are a <unk> hormones .
"most women , as i -- i believe , a typical woman to come up -- i don &apos;t know how much sort of don &apos;t look , but i think probably have the <unk> of -- which i really are talking , actually , in fact , kind of traffic <unk> ."
"we make <unk> control , and we <unk> at <unk> ."
"and the <unk> is that somebody like me , is that actually doing more , that has been close to business than a woman who was born with <unk> and has a space doctor ."
"so symmetry is really complicated ; lights portion is not just in the middle of the movement of the location -- in some <unk> , as you can , you can crawl to the whole diversity ."
"another example : a few years ago i got the phone call from 19 or a human age , when young mountains had gotten grown to her , he had a girlfriend to friend with his brother , and he had <unk> his husband and here ."
he had a <unk> <unk> form of <unk> .
"he has been able to get rid of <unk> , and in the ninth <unk> , so its <unk> <unk> strength was so active that they got essentially a male <unk> ."
"and as an result , his <unk> corn <unk> , its brain was brought in to the <unk> part of the road scan ."
"and , as the birth of being born , he saw how much -- some no ones thought about something ."
"and until only when he was 21 years old , he had enough medical issues , actually because he just <unk> out , because they decided that bus was <unk> from within that law ."
"okay , just just an immediate example , very elaborate sample ."
"and some people with monterey chromosomes , just develop a key structure called magnetic calcium <unk> ."
we don &apos;t know exactly why it happens .
"so , gender groups can happen in many different tricks ."
"the reason why children with this kind of body -- is it any ngos or smiling , though surgeons often emerged -- often the option allow <unk> to be concentrated , isn &apos;t because they did that it &apos;s a physical advantage of their physical advantage ."
"in many cases , these people are completely healthy ."
"the reason that often most <unk> types of biological child is , because they add only to our social categories ."
"usually , our system , into the idea that there is also a certain in certain <unk> of profoundly identity ."
"so , we have the concept that if you &apos;ll be a woman , this is to have a <unk> identity , if you agree a black person , you need a <unk> <unk> of <unk> education in terms of a way that &apos;s secret ."
so we have this horrible wrong idea .
"and by being <unk> with a body that , for us , something really different , an closely confused of ourselves in these types ."
so we &apos;ve now <unk> a lot of cornell ideas about <unk> .
and our nation is really <unk> by a very rough concept .
"now you can imagine how amazing it is , when children are born in one body , they &apos;re two people at the body of speech ."
"so then , one <unk> <unk> last year , which i gave was the most <unk> key mapping recording year , whose foreign <unk> in <unk> , of the western audience came with earth ."
well a lot of journalist didn &apos;t come to me with the question : &quot; what that test will show you ; <unk> <unk> is <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
"and i had to explain that in journalists now , that there didn &apos;t do this <unk> ."
"we know that families are shorter knowledge available resource and that we have to explore that nature does not take the line between food and <unk> and <unk> , or <unk> , and <unk> , at <unk> , we &apos;re the subject strategy agent of them ."
so we &apos;ve had a situation like where on <unk> our science reserve so that we have to show that these categories that we were given for educational gardens which gave very straightforward various choices : we &apos;ve been shifting even a huge approach to <unk> to less information .
and that doesn &apos;t matter just as terms of gender .
it also gets more often in terms of race that any more complicated than our <unk> needs .
we <unk> within all kinds of little measures of different kinds of things .
"for example , we took in the case , in the fact that we all have 95 percent of our dna with chimps in common ."
what will we begin to do with the fact that we &apos;re getting in a few <unk> from them ?
"now the way that we continue our science closer to further , we need to be involved in a zone of the east valley , which is that the <unk> category , we &apos;re probably so bad ."
you see this in all sorts of different life of human life .
"one of the areas we see that the majority of <unk> in our field today is developing in life in the history today , the race at the beginning to the <unk> and the end of life ."
we have an difficult conversation about which dot will be a body to people to get there like the right thing there is .
"we now have very difficult <unk> imaging -- we may not have as a public sort of stuff in medicine -- of , about when someone &apos;s dead ."
our ancestors used to never be the cause of <unk> when was die .
"so you &apos;ve been cutting in a <unk> when you have a <unk> , and if you go and move , they haven &apos;t <unk> it yet ."
"and if it has gone , you <unk> it ."
"but today , we are in a situation where we take people to take organs out and throw them into some human hands ."
"and as <unk> , we understood by the <unk> question of , where the rich was said . and it does be made us in a really hard , in which we haven &apos;t as bold flag as u.s. times as soon as this ."
now they could suggest that the whole thing that would make some of categories that would really <unk> me .
"i &apos;m <unk> to <unk> , so i get people alive with <unk> bodies , but i &apos;ve got to ask that it &apos;s really nervous ."
"to understand that these categories are really curious <unk> than we thought , well , i &apos;m confident : at me ."
and it <unk> me onto those <unk> that democracy <unk> .
"so to talk about that english share , i have to listen for first to i feel that i was a big engineer from our <unk> ."
"i know they were <unk> , they know they were people <unk> , but they were great ."
"i think that they were more engineered , and so radical , which for questions that i &apos;ve done all taken a long time to look at operating <unk> computer &apos;s drawing and is not because of music that it &apos;s absolutely <unk> ."
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happening with the <unk> networks .
"they were the key record from my journey to the transformed activists , therefore in reason ."
"what they were doing was an even independent idea , and they were using a different device which was rational and beautiful for us <unk> ."
"they &apos;re <unk> all of the stages of falling out and giving rid of our somewhat <unk> , but the <unk> industry on a very <unk> concept of <unk> ."
"the <unk> of the ancient world had not had a concept based on the dna based on this point , but they had an idea of how that car decline ."
they have a concept of blood cells .
"they were the <unk> that , people who were doing to political power should have that political power , because of the brilliant hand <unk> from sent to your father and so on ."
"they opened the urban eyes and realized that by this <unk> , through a really new idea , and this concept said that all the people have been creating <unk> ."
"you see the deep <unk> , and her decided that <unk> <unk> down the cone deforestation , not the differences , and it was very radical ."
well they made that part because they had become a subtle system that happened to <unk> this two things .
"democracy grew , but the same time was still growing up science ."
"if you look at the history of crisis , the distinction is obviously that many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in the concept of a <unk> world ."
"they went away from dozens of temporary <unk> that have to do something like a really <unk> concept of power , where the <unk> talks about a very simplistic version of behavioral a slum composed ."
they turned around a serious idea .
"and we look at the psychological movement in , they speak about nature and the god of nature ."
they don &apos;t talk by god and <unk> nature .
and what it gives you from the power of nature to tell us who we are .
"and as part of it , they account from a network of <unk> <unk> ."
"and on that it really quickly , <unk> the future fleet for forever ."
"and they didn &apos;t think it about this , but what they did for us was amazing ."
so what did many years then ?
"for example , women used to <unk> for exactly the role of understanding , which says that collaboration is <unk> important in the positive nor said that i should have a <unk> , and a secret cure for history that we cannot perceive as well , an worth not description , that almost elegance ."
and women fought this morning .
"and the next morning , the <unk> <unk> , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> <unk> , who was during the time , i &apos;m not a woman ? &quot;"
"we find men in the bill of <unk> coming , the souls of <unk> . america do i &apos;m a guy . &quot;"
"again , people reached opinions , that shared both <unk> for <unk> <unk> standards , bold and successful ."
we see this same thing around the fire tank .
"of course , the problem is that and , all the <unk> , we also start to look into , what we know is , we &apos;re looking for within , why we pay certain constellations ."
"well soft , what i would like to <unk> this certain <unk> 3d opportunity in our culture ."
"for example , i don &apos;t want to give you the same rules for people like a human ."
i don &apos;t like to say that we should yet take <unk> from the district .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> really should have the kind of to give your <unk> or to marry to marry .
"so , there &apos;s been a bunch of pink figure that make for me understand , and i think , should i keep yourselves ."
"but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep it , and whether it feels a lot of good ."
"so let &apos;s come back to those two , the very angiogenesis creatures that have been touched at the beginning of the talk ."
"we have two character , both in the most of the same day climbed in the same classroom ."
"let &apos;s wondered that one of them , maria , carl <unk> , <unk> <unk> , was born at square 12 there in june 2000 ."
"henry , on the other side , is going to born to the <unk> ; so , let &apos;s born one at march ."
"just because of the fact that &quot; maria <unk> 3 months are born by <unk> they had all these kinds of sorts of died of names of returning <unk> , had a fake right to drink ."
"emily are going to wait for all that , because he &apos;s actually his top-down structure , just because of its <unk> being at birth ."
we &apos;re still finding others in terms of what they &apos;re not here .
"martin , you just <unk> that he &apos;s ignored -- though i &apos;m not told you that it &apos;s off with the fight -- there he gets <unk> , he can get <unk> , but will start setting on speak out , which is just <unk> ."
"but mainly , by <unk> , we can &apos;t look at the same thing in all states like the sen in every states , and it &apos;s true to marry ."
"henry can marry an independent has married , but marco is only two states today funded to be a woman ."
so we have these safer <unk> <unk> categories that are <unk> a problem of pain and business tools .
"and to ask me , what will we do , with our economics into the field of volume , that we can be at a point where we need to step in the end of what an clinical is business going on here means to <unk> economic growth ?"
"i &apos;m not just going to give science to science , but at the same time it usually does to get it to basically play on the rest ."
so where are we going ?
it turns out that &apos;s . <unk> are our kind of acting to a way of <unk> that we must go anywhere . &quot; so we step somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people got <unk> trapped in a very strange position .
"so for example , texas , decided in some point , was that a man must marry a man , saying that you didn &apos;t have y to get a 43 releases that you have a y <unk> ."
"now in practice , people are not tested on their muscle assignments ."
"but it &apos;s also very powerful , because of the story i told you about the starting in ."
"and so when you see the top of the real democracy democracy , dr. martin made by king , he <unk> for us , &quot; i have a thought in his bulgaria . &quot;"
"he says that we should not take people as their drug goal , but to <unk> in their test of their character , and goes out beyond <unk> ."
"and i want to say , &quot; yes , this sounds like a really good idea . &quot;"
but what do you do about the practice ?
how do you <unk> people to listen those oiled ?
i also want to consider that i &apos;m not sure that we should <unk> rights to people to are designed on people because i have to say that i know a series of golden miracle standard that probably probably do more <unk> than some people .
"i want to remember that i probably know a few brief family issues that are flexible , <unk> , on the spectacular , memory systems in their mind , to meet people off some minds , which i know ."
so what should we apply to the properties of the character ?
it turns out to be just a sudden .
"and one part of her says , what would be if the content would take one special that could be made in the <unk> to an alpha barry -- being made through an operation in an equilibrium ?"
does we really want to go into that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going to go .
"what i know is that this really important seems to , the idea of thinking that the united states is <unk> to say , thinking about democracy ."
"in our experiment , we started to do truly recently , and i think we &apos;d make our idea in the future so good ."
"we have this situation of what the typical of iran is , with a man <unk> , who &apos;s embarrassing food , is being blessed with the death . he &apos;s been being ready to be happy , the death engine of <unk> within purposes ."
well it has not been like this .
so i &apos;m happy to say that we have not such a flexible model -- a surgeon with me speaking so it had some <unk> that just opened a few four of luxury <unk> to a find aspect .
"but when i started talking to him , and asked him why he were going to do that as current <unk> -- it was a <unk> to his understanding that a country was very bad kids , that the children were that they were going to do ."
"i sent him , &quot; now , do you have brought to political <unk> into market rather than just the surgery ? &quot;"
the united states benefits incredible opportunities to people that are without the place that you will change yourself .
so i think that we need to be more sophisticated .
"all right -- just to help , i &apos;d closer to realize that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers ."
"and i want to think about the possibilities like how democracy could look more , or something , or would have <unk> over the moms ."
"and i want to say something that &apos;s fairly radical for generating conflict , and i think in that there can be different kinds of insights to provide individual <unk> who are doing different kinds of different kinds of the most possibility of survival when we make <unk> ."
i &apos;ve been interested in thinking in participation now because i &apos;ve been interested in research spills in research .
and one of the things that i thought really interesting is what goes between men and women are in terms of other things as they &apos;re thinking about to the world .
"what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> students is that women , who are already -- not standards of history , but on average -- rather than <unk> social relationships and health care movements which are <unk> in the group , in the group for humanity ."
and that &apos;s why when we think about that we are the curious situation before ourselves .
"like , a great student , when i was doing an <unk> , said , the one of my vagina <unk> i knew i had known -- i looked at my <unk> , so it &apos;s going to do it -- a real <unk> question ."
"he said , &quot; tell me what the hunger movement is <unk> . &quot;"
"and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the real question that i &apos;ve ever heard ."
"feminism is about <unk> pain , which is essentially violent ."
"but the more i thought about his question to be better , as i thought there was something in feminism ."
"this will come into , you know , that there may be something that can give female brains more <unk> by <unk> , which helps us to <unk> new minds and i believe in a variety of other <unk> ."
"so where the treatment <unk> <unk> were <unk> to explore how individuals could protected from the country , there &apos;s possible that if we <unk> employees into this concept , we will have a more concept and , in fact , how to do we can come up all the <unk> ."
"and so maybe what we &apos;re going to do in the future , if we shall <unk> democracy across sustainable tracking less about individual bodies to think about what identity is and more about schizophrenia ."
"and so , if we were trying to bring parts together as the human , we think about what &apos;s about to do ."
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> and this is my suitcase .
"but before i show you what i &apos;ve done , i &apos;m going to make an <unk> public <unk> , and this is an obsession , i &apos;m always <unk> ."
"and i love to work on every asteroid and treat using <unk> <unk> with one another <unk> , and last years again , learning and to animations too ."
but i &apos;m not running around between all .
i get all my clothes from <unk> and child chairs and in music .
audience to make it handsome .
"<unk> <unk> allows to devote the impact to attach into the environment , to my angel in ."
"i meet all kinds of beautiful people ; my dollars are typically treated a good purpose -- i see pretty much larger , and it creates me <unk> of rather personal weight ."
so i mean what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be this size ?
so i &apos;ll paint with the paint ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all of those reply we feel like i won .
"i come back to my suitcase , and i tell you what &apos;s that exciting week at ted the debate , &quot; 15 seconds , &quot; right ? &quot;"
"i mean , what does someone take these kinds of <unk> ?"
so i &apos;m going to show you pretty much what i was calling .
"i took seven <unk> out , and it &apos;s all ."
"just for instance , thing about this very week is all i &apos;ve done in my suitcase ."
i feel that i &apos;d come through anything i &apos;d basically tried to carry if i &apos;d get to <unk> .
and having sits from me as the <unk> who is going through ted in her <unk> -- that &apos;s what i found out a couple of things .
and i &apos;ll quickly show you my collection wish for this week .
does that really know ?
"as i do it , i &apos;m going to go <unk> to some of the lessons i should believe this or not be some that works from those <unk> experience to sit don &apos;t ."
so let &apos;s start with <unk> .
i call that the tigers .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money . go photos .
and you can <unk> almost decades to less than 50 dollars .
"this whole thing , the <unk> of defense by the very <unk> swim 900 , and it had been daughter , and it was the research that i was tagged all about this week ."
poem : color is something kind of <unk> .
there are almost no <unk> to be bad <unk> when you wear <unk> .
"if you &apos;re happy , you extend other happy people ."
station : <unk> is right now .
"i &apos;ve spent a very much time put my life thinking , to go even distant , i &apos;m even beginning to treat ."
do you feel like that you are .
"if you evolved to people with the big people , you &apos;ll not only understand it , you &apos;ll get it ."
<unk> : hold her interior .
sometimes people tell me i even were able to play out of the when i enjoy either <unk> or i could remember they <unk> .
"i got my favorites and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;"
<unk> : confidence is the key .
"if you think you &apos;re fine in something , it &apos;s almost sure ."
"and if you think you &apos;re not fine , you might probably have kind of right ."
i grew up with a mother which taught me every day .
"but just by becoming 30 , i really understood what that means ."
and i &apos;ll finish it up for you for that .
"when you believe that in a way that you &apos;re in and you &apos;re a wonderful person , you &apos;ve got nowhere you can &apos;t wearing ."
"so , you &apos;re not sorry for someone in this audience ."
so we should be able to fix anything that we want .
thank you .
"yochai : a <unk> reality -- five words , <unk> contribute to ."
"and finally , <unk> , is an apartment to design personal style , a great way about the world having to talk about it without a word , to say inequality ."
"i was always been <unk> and <unk> when billions of people on her week , just within me that , just because of things i was wearing , and i had a great chance ."
obviously it &apos;s not going to fit it in these little boring suitcase .
"so before i go home to <unk> , i &apos;ll release this thing again ."
because the lesson i have involved studying is that it &apos;s okay to let happen .
"i don &apos;t have to <unk> those things , because the right around the road , that &apos;s where there &apos;s always a different crazy <unk> -- <unk> diagnosed that <unk> drive just to me when i have a little bit of heart and find it ."
thank you very much .
thank you .
good rides all .
i &apos;ve left this with i &apos;m interested in it .
"so think of that as a <unk> , more productive ."
"this is what we call in our laboratory , <unk> design ."
let me tell you a little bit about it .
"now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m a great film <unk> , and every young man in northern italy is in his room , and the reason why i &apos;ll show you about that this was happening in <unk> last several years about this following ."
"now , you know , some time ago , when you wanted to win a formula on this swarthmore , then you took it , and have taken it to good driver and drive a good car ."
"and once the car and the car were good enough , then they won the race ."
"now today , in an race , you know where you &apos;re going to winning a race , really what this one &apos;s actually known as this car <unk> in time , some thousand sensors in your car , the information system , using this system , and what makes that wider gases and <unk> place information systems and"
"and they call that in <unk> , when i talk they actually call a <unk> ."
and basically it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made by two parts -- an absolute <unk> and a half .
what &apos;s interesting today is about the <unk> start coming to us .
"our cities have been <unk> to the most bats for the last few years , with the electronics and with electronics ."
they &apos;re becoming the <unk> for computers .
"and as computers as breast computers , they begin to react to other ways , they &apos;re being arranged and driven ."
"when we leave cities , it &apos;s really a big thing ."
"very therefore , to storytelling , two percent of the world is only in earth and a half percent of the global population ."
it &apos;s 75 percent of the weight -- <unk> to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
"so when we do something with cities , that &apos;s a big thing ."
"and in the cities , all of those eyes are <unk> and they put in objects together in the everyday life ."
"this is from a <unk> , the <unk> cycle for computer shows in six days later , <unk> ."
"it says , &quot; <unk> me . &quot;"
"well , all of our aspects of our environments , we begin to go back to talk ."
"it &apos;s as much as if each other is <unk> because there &apos;s too 100 <unk> out there , with a flying juice ."
and they are radically different by interactions that we have people with our environment .
"in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of child <unk> ..."
"do you know if <unk> <unk> painted the <unk> was that , he took the approach to the hammer and just jumped into <unk> -- but you can still see another image , <unk> , and she said , &quot; she didn &apos;t worry , &quot; <unk> ?"
"well , now our environment starts to come back in way to responses to the answer ."
"i &apos;m going to show you some examples of -- again , to manipulate the idea of our environment and power ."
so let &apos;s begin to see with that .
now the first project i want to show you is really where i &apos;m going to give you our first of our own home .
and there were four and a half a couple of years ago in italy .
"and in fact , what we did have now was a new sort of network using the world in which these entire world is six billion code -- and <unk> <unk> information from this network to software is the <unk> materials being passed from the ground in which communication ."
"and the summer , it was an <unk> summer -- 2006 ."
it was like delhi left the <unk> <unk> .
"and some of you will remember this , of this , when organized versus <unk> , to the <unk> of <unk> , who <unk> ."
"and whatever it &apos;s done , in italy you won ."
now you can see what happened in this day and this particular is just <unk> . it &apos;s happening during the network .
you can see a city .
"you see the <unk> in the line , the back of the <unk> worker ."
"and tomorrow , in the position ."
you &apos;re seeing <unk> .
"started in the day , people there and the one , the calls , who get <unk> ."
the game starts -- forever .
"<unk> makes a <unk> . in italy , a friendly ; it makes a periodic table ."
"<unk> , who make people a quick call , go to mud ."
second <unk> mixed . end of the normal verse .
"first of all , second ."
"<unk> , so <unk> the weight ."
in prison desert . yeah .
"now in that night , everybody went to <unk> to celebrate ."
they saw the big box .
"next day , all of the bill went to make cocaine and won on the same minister ."
and then all then went down .
"and they look at the image of the city and it &apos;s future where people have to come into <unk> things as a review , to have a big party , and they look at the end of the end of the day ."
"well that &apos;s just one examples we can have the city , in a way that we can do a few years ago ."
"again , still as an example of looking for a thing : this is not for humans , but by the things we use and consume ."
"well , today we know everything from where to where we &apos;re coming from ."
"so , this is a map that shows you all the design centers taken off that sort of a mac -- as they came together ."
but we just don &apos;t know how to go .
"so in this project , we actually started building several little pieces around the <unk> as it comes through the system ."
"so , we started with a few volunteers who helped us , spent something more than a year , in seattle , developing things that they could give long and illustrate just different ways of this sort of -- stuff they &apos;d wiped out ."
"and then we took the little bit , the little touch , we have the little brands , it &apos;s up and beginning to track it ."
so here are the results we are actually ever a .
atoms ... .
after week .
"with that information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of information that &apos;s in the system ."
and they can actually do the same stuff in reverse with less energy .
the data had been resolved before .
but it has lots of bumps <unk> and more complicated stuff .
"but the other thing here is that we believe that in every day we see the speed that the coming we throw , we use , not easy that they get them further anywhere on the planet ."
and the sugar <unk> that we <unk> still throw out every single day .
"and if we &apos;ll show the people , then we can put together a clear station ."
so this is why this project is for this project .
"so my colleague to meet , <unk> by the <unk> , could you experience as much more about that one other and some other creative stuff you can min , but i would like to talk the next part and how to move on our behavior ."
"and the first project is , i think , in <unk> , we &apos;ve done a few years ago , spain ."
"it started to start by a question about scale of the <unk> <unk> , which came to us and said that spain and created a beautiful tradition to form a three-dimensional heritage such part of building space is part of architecture ."
"and the question was : how could you relate to technology with it , new technology ?"
"and one of the ideas that had been determined by a mustache , imagine this <unk> cell in front , and the motor owner , that got right , those , <unk> , you &apos;re opening and free ."
it will cause anything like a to take with dry <unk> .
"if they weigh up , you can write them coming together , <unk> images , text <unk> ."
"and you can write , and it will open to god , and let you put it on this image , you can see in the picture ."
"now , we &apos;ve launched the <unk> discussion ."
and it struck him very awkward .
and we got a <unk> <unk> for the expo to design .
we called it up with the digital water .
all that building was cotton .
"there is no phone or <unk> , but if you start to look at them , it will open and get you into it ."
the roof was covered with water .
"and that &apos;s as if it &apos;s <unk> , if you like to <unk> the <unk> that , you can actually raise the roof ."
"or you could contact the buildings and get whole , like this ."
"no , you won &apos;t destroyed that building , it is just that architecture goes away ."
you &apos;ll see what the building works .
you see the person who &apos;s speaking what &apos;s happening .
"and here , you &apos;ll see me when i tried to see the sensors that make the water go , it &apos;s not being thin ."
now i should tell you what one night had happened when the light of all of the electrical signals worked .
"but it was actually more <unk> , of course , at the past night ."
"all children came from high-speed songs , had to the building because of the sort of idea they would have there with the building , fundamentally ."
"no longer to a building , that would open to move them there , but a building that had still does , it had to keep silence and water , you &apos;ve got to <unk> from now on to getting out of silver !"
"and that &apos;s true for us , for us , not as designers , karl engineers , as designers , we think , all the things about how humans do that , the things we design ."
but reality is all <unk> .
"and this is the beauty of creating things that are used to start using people , as you interact with it ."
"now here is a picture of the building with the patient <unk> , the heat from water and the <unk> <unk> ."
"and that &apos;s what powerful brought all over the project , this is what i was really showing you right now ."
imagine the <unk> could really start <unk> .
"think about a way that you could have little <unk> around the air , and everyone at one with them with a small thin <unk> <unk> of light -- almost like one wave on the nest can move through the room ."
here &apos;s the video .
"imagine if you saw a <unk> of <unk> , such as you &apos;ve seen earlier , with others in fully -- you &apos;re going to do again ."
you can have this rain .
"you can have a sort of wing screen eyes , and an software screen , like this -- <unk> sort of leg , <unk> two dimensions ."
"and it &apos;s picking up three dimensions , which can change what &apos;s change , not the part , the <unk> in the condition ."
you can play in various types .
"imagine life simple , <unk> in many different memory , <unk> in different <unk> ."
"but then this can only hold a hamburger camera all over the cloud , to show them back and move through again as many ways they can watch it from lots of light ."
you see a real cheese <unk> animal being made by recorded the way that you have there died as formal <unk> .
"if you use the light , it looks like that , as you saw it ."
"so , imagine that every single one of people will put up ."
"it could have a need every single <unk> , which will come from people who are <unk> from the movements of people or something like ."
i want to show you about one of the first .
"we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of our most passionate speech , who got separated at the &apos; side of the <unk> tower in new york , and from <unk> -- we <unk> its movements in 3d shape for using the current ."
they see nurses <unk> dancing there .
"on the left , look at the art video . <unk> <unk> papers ."
it &apos;s very comfortable once and there &apos;s a film map .
so that they can understand that it can <unk> .
you can make the whole time .
"but then , once in common bread , you can play it , with color moving and <unk> and sweet play ."
we want this as a <unk> <unk> for the <unk> .
"now , i &apos;m going to show you the the current project that we &apos;re working on ."
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
and it &apos;s called the <unk> of the it .
"again , the notion is , imagine what we &apos;re keeping with people around and to do something -- to make kind of place , as much as we call it , we call <unk> , and do a sharp , and <unk> the cloud ."
so imagine that every small <unk> can give a check .
"i think that &apos;s amazing decline in the last <unk> year last 12 , this is that now fusion for most of a <unk> to just a physical world ."
"that has all grow by gaps , and it &apos;s all available by the internet ."
"today , we can move in , for the first time -- and the campaign has <unk> this , we can transition from the digital world , the <unk> forces in the physical physics ."
"and what can be in our case is that we use to design it , in a process ."
which is the story of the city that is built .
"but tomorrow will we know what to <unk> the challenges is to challenge us -- think about climate change or climate change -- like our , from the digital world , we go <unk> from the physical world ."
"so the idea is that , actually , that &apos;s the idea of that is that we &apos;re <unk> the people that you &apos;re doing with things like you might have something to do ."
"the cloud is suddenly a cloud of <unk> , in the same way that there is one black cloud of <unk> from <unk> ."
and these particles are water while our cloud is a cloud of particles in oil .
"it &apos;s a <unk> gene in london , but covered with bacteria ."
they can move down between words and make different kinds of experience .
"you can actually look at this majority of palm , the most important moments of 2012 and some sort of recognize and also have it differ from community ."
"so both those keys , the physical line in heaven and can go this top of sand from a native dog ."
they can <unk> .
"and a powerful digital <unk> in night -- but as <unk> , a new way of the experience for everyone who wants to go to the tip ."
thank you .
"as artists , the relationship is very important to me ."
"through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that humans are not separate from nature , and that anything is connected ."
the first time i &apos;ve been <unk> from the monetary growth in which i was the first final tradition that i saw .
"for me , help and the heavens ."
"my heart scared , was going to be naive during me as i was trying to <unk> what was stood on my bed ."
"it &apos;s gone around from <unk> by a $ 60 meter , and i was able to block that this was a cancer <unk> in a different one year , year ."
babies are born as an underground <unk> or by <unk> from <unk> .
anytime you have any value of their individual personality .
they &apos;re interacting with their environment and with their experiences .
"there are some tales of sharing them and 1,000 <unk> <unk> of labor , without giving them more and more <unk> have been introduced ."
"you &apos;re looking at a symmetry , and you can think that they &apos;re <unk> , apart , damaged and alone , just as we see humans often see ."
but the truth is far away from them .
"as a continuum loses , i <unk> its <unk> atmosphere ."
"as this titan iceberg , it <unk> <unk> <unk> water so that many different lives meets fetus ."
"i &apos;m going to my shots of these <unk> <unk> in which i &apos;m being in babies , so i do portraits in consciousness that land in those individual types of evidence of different species , and ever could exist again ."
"it &apos;s not children when they melt ; it &apos;s not <unk> , but the original sort of <unk> of their switch up along the surface of the bag ."
one of the streams of mine in <unk> my offspring is very young -- some couple thousand years old .
"and a part of that &apos;s <unk> more than 100,000 years old ."
and the last images that i want to show you are going to play by a hill that i have in <unk> in <unk> .
"not very rare , in fact , they will actually set off a road flow ."
here is the point as you can see .
"on the left-hand side side , you see a little boat ."
this is about five <unk> long .
please watch the shape on the flower and where it is at death .
"and you can see here , he starts wings , and the boat <unk> it to another else is moving there ."
it &apos;s the average size of a car level .
"it broke <unk> out of the water , from the water , or 40 feet ."
and that video is at real time .
and just as i &apos;ll just show you another definition of his personality .
thank you .
my lives really <unk> boring to the work of a couple of amazing projects .
but with the <unk> i &apos;ve ever been working in has started to get that guy .
his name is <unk> .
"on their intellect , one of the leading <unk> of civil colleges ."
"then , one day he came out of play and said , &quot; look <unk> -- my legs were breaking . &quot;"
and that was the <unk> of patent .
<unk> is just fully paralyzed now .
he can only use his eyes even though .
and i turned left towards him .
"i have a company that makes this designed and see animations , so aurora &apos;s going to be a wider inch of what we 64 in the fictional gases and <unk> ."
"we &apos;ve decided that tony , go <unk> -- that will educate him at the moment ."
"i met his father , and his brother and will say , &quot; we will give you that money ."
what are you going to do with that ? &quot;
"and his brother said , &quot; i only want to talk to tony back just ."
"so , i just want to asking him for you , and i &apos;m like , &quot; be i wasn &apos;t -- i did elegance of hawking -- can &apos;t we all universe to these tools with this devices . &quot;"
"and he said , &quot; no , just if you &apos;ve heard about higher <unk> , and a remarkable sheep can do it , i really want to do that ."
normal people are not being brought into these devices . &quot;
"and i said , &quot; well , how do you <unk> ? &quot;"
"any note the movie , as he was seeing in the &quot; <unk> ? &quot;"
so they communicate -- these are like just going with their fingers .
"i &apos;m going to , &quot; very <unk> , how is that going to be ? &quot;"
"so i came along with this good one , just asking a <unk> , where you put an <unk> , i didn &apos;t have the project on where i was <unk> ."
"i can ask myself the way , and this personal brother and his dad , with the words , &quot; well , my revenue is the <unk> -- tony friend , you &apos;ll speak for him to be a grain and to be able to do to find your media again ."
"because , it &apos;s bruce is a restaurant that is given this all this in stroke -- that doesn &apos;t serve . &quot;"
so i talked to a couple of months after all of that .
"i met these guys of <unk> , hacker <unk> movie research , and they have that technology that allows them to <unk> any soil and then introduce <unk> to them with a <unk> game that puts it on only the same region a direct area ."
"so they &apos;re <unk> the walk , and they do selfish ones ."
"they tell everybody that gets worth together , <unk> will follow ."
"and it starts with the food <unk> that people say after that , the street workers , and they &apos;re actually doing this , the people actually make art ."
but it always occurred to us through food centers .
"so i went home and cook with my wife and told her about and and we thought , &quot; well , i think , if there were technology you can use to make things like that , that we could make it be &quot; things like it , the other ones ."
it was the <unk> learning ever .
"and for about two years later , a year after a bunch of organization , a lot of prevalence and a lot along about things , we &apos;ve made some of things ."
"first is , we have the businesses in 1973 , the rid of the doors , and we actually got a device that they &apos;re actually actually <unk> with a device that could communicate with -- a jazz magic song ."
that &apos;s amazing .
"and it &apos;s really extraordinary about this -- i call it <unk> , because you talk to him or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so happy , that guy &apos;s incredible . &quot;"
it &apos;s also and we <unk> up with seven programmers all the world -- literally from all the pieces of the world -- to home .
"my wife , my kids , and i carried them into the garage and those tend to provide <unk> and instruments and partners took their home ."
"and , tens of hours of our friends thought that we were lovely man doing this , and we &apos;d literally ignore all the images from the walls to the walls ."
"but for two weeks we built , we went to nigeria for three weeks with <unk> <unk> , my children were <unk> , my dog and we also dragged that here ."
and it &apos;s called space <unk> and you can see the description .
"it &apos;s a huge nutritional networking solution we <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , some <unk> , and a few things out of the <unk> , a kindergarten cycle and from the beginning <unk> ."
"we took a more temperature driver , we put them into a <unk> and now we now have lost the device to it ; you can build it so we make the code &apos;s code , and we can do it <unk> of software for mice ."
"so , we created a device that &apos;s entirely free of material ."
no incentives can get a bet .
also no hospital .
"now , every hand i can communicate with now we can communicate with their eyes or draw ."
thank you .
thank you very much . that &apos;s incredibly <unk> .
"so on the end of the two weeks , we went back to babies in the empty room ."
"i love that picture , and it &apos;s about someone else &apos;s room , and this is his room ."
"because the story is now increasing , at big , <unk> met from the great <unk> ."
"and over a year , a year of planning , two weeks of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , so clip came back in the first time after seven years ."
"and the <unk> image is , because this is its implications , and it looks beyond <unk> ."
we live his bed <unk> to see it out .
"we took <unk> , time you wake up a wall of light at the hospital ."
"and i saw taken by the first time of it was in the reception , when they lost family , and you can imagine what was in a sense of a parking space ."
"and we had to continue to <unk> in a businessman in the parking lot , so we liked it as a part of a <unk> ."
"at the end , it just calls a email to us , for the first time , so i &apos;ve <unk> some research for seven years ."
"i have that feeling reduced in between water and finally someone <unk> and thrown out to the bottom and <unk> by it , so i can breathe down . &quot;"
isn &apos;t that <unk> ?
and that &apos;s what your brand <unk> said .
that holds us on the campaign national government and continuing to <unk> .
and we also have to improve on that device .
"it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s beginning to get much more precise ."
and they want somebody who has such unexpected opportunity to do this much more much .
and so we &apos;re <unk> to see how to do it better and more and more imaginative .
since this have gotten for all of its recognition .
we &apos;ve won a few prices .
"you &apos;d assume it &apos;s free , no one out of it ."
it comes all out of our own <unk> .
"so the <unk> were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;"
"armstrong <unk> over us , and then , december , have been <unk> for <unk> as an iranian one of 2010 , which was really grade in the middle 12th ."
"the <unk> of this is -- and we &apos;ve <unk> this whole circle -- that that it would consider this april , right now , waiting to be <unk> to the photographer of los angeles , called the of the proposal of the world ."
"and there are , very isolated , probably the pregnancies of <unk> use -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , so these guys will be there ."
"<unk> is going to be part of the show , which is rather <unk> ."
"so , basically , i &apos;ll go about thinking , what &apos;s not surprisingly , the construction rate &apos;s possible ."
"all in this room was kind of impossible -- this angle , this computer , this newspaper , which was one <unk> -- was it &apos;s impossible to a spell ."
don &apos;t do it -- you all last !
"i &apos;m not going to have no programmer and never had some without experiment , but i have just been <unk> and <unk> along with me , and let me sit with the legs , on this little legs a bit ."
"and that question is then everyone of you , at every single day , about something else that have to do it ? when doesn &apos;t come in and when there &apos;s — and wouldn &apos;t you ?"
thank you .
"so , i write for children , and certainly america is sugar <unk> often , in the most <unk> <unk> ."
and i always &apos;ll keep talking about the people that i don &apos;t want to know about as a scientist .
"we can have waited as a farmer , which is to be entrepreneurs in <unk> , but nobody ever <unk> ."
i want to tell you about an <unk> and circular <unk> .
"well , , the <unk> for the sport is actually usually something , you find because you run somewhere ."
you go over the deck and it goes as a star .
and this is an <unk> painting .
so one of my friends has made it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated you want to tell you today .
"and my circle then started into the girls in the 70s , <unk> , <unk> where i was <unk> ."
"and i was one of the <unk> coming into the <unk> <unk> green and blue , until a maid my life was <unk> ."
"she gave me my life , by looking to the toilet the toilet community ."
did they fix god .
she did it for three years .
and i had to move away from the city .
"i had one <unk> ; i was writing tonight , and i <unk> was to san francisco in california -- i found a third of it in the 80s -- and at the once i found a visual work going out of where <unk> ."
"perhaps about three or four years ago , i received the cycle of the night ; i &apos;m going to start by a <unk> , <unk> by saying , &quot; i have to see you ."
i &apos;m sad that we never can know each other as adults .
"you can see this , please come and i say it meeting you with the man i know that you had found it out there ."
"and i should mention that i have a free , and i want you to give you the question . &quot;"
"now , the next day we were in <unk> ."
"and we looked at them , we <unk> at <unk> , we knew they needed to be in a <unk> ."
"we found one thing for them , we took them away , and we presented ourselves to them , and we given our family for eight , because it had to deal ."
there was something that we knew .
"and right now as the woman who thought of as adults wanted to learn , imagine me that would be moving into an <unk> <unk> , and got it turned into my hands ."
"what happened was that the lens had broke , the circle was population , and the <unk> of mine , which showed me ."
<unk> is 8 : but death is a part of life .
"it made my lives smarter , and my partner and i was <unk> my partner ."
"and you know , this part of life takes everything in the ground to take place ."
"he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this has been this many just mentioned here ."
"it doesn &apos;t use yet -- he must have love and love , and we have these things ."
thank you .
"imagine a big percentage across a feet , you know , of rise to 100,000 feet ."
imagine an airplane full beat .
"imagine a file analogy , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> power ."
that sounds <unk> .
"now , i had an <unk> place on this day ; i sat in <unk> ."
i was the only one i was able to speak with the <unk> ceremony .
"so i watched them right now , and they said , &quot; no problem , we probably put some birds in a few other . &quot;"
"the <unk> had all the <unk> <unk> , and we were not as much further ."
you could see houses .
"two minutes later , three things a different evening ."
the key bears set out to the hudson district .
these are acting not the most <unk> .
he breaks the free <unk> .
"guess how again , do you tap a failed airplane ."
"and then he said , yesterday -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard ."
"and he says , &quot; <unk> &quot;"
i didn &apos;t have to talk much more to the players .
i could see it in your eyes because it was <unk> to get the life .
so i want to tell you three things i learned about this day in the day .
and i learned that nothing different in the moment .
"we have this survey , you have a major policy we have , that we device and i thought of all the people that i wanted to do a hand , and wasn &apos;t try all the pilot and never get the experience , that i wanted to do about all the wisdom and talk about what i could"
"as later , over thoughts , i started a <unk> , which thinks , &quot; i &apos;m taking bad <unk> . &quot;"
"because if you &apos;re <unk> and the person is there , then i open him ."
i never want to have more functionality in life .
"and narratives , that fate , hasn &apos;t changed my life ."
"the second thing i learned from that day -- that is when we went down to george washington bridge , rather than to <unk> -- i thought -- was a person , which is a one thing i find in one ."
i had a great life .
"my own humanity , and with my fault , i teach myself to be more to everything i did in some ways ."
but i also gave the worthwhile room in my <unk> crowd .
and i &apos;m always <unk> at the time doing things that type for lighting things i start with people who mean something .
"and i thought about to my wife &apos;s relationship with my friends , to mourn people ."
"and after that , when i thought about this , i decided to plan negative energy from my life ."
"it &apos;s totally perfect , but it &apos;s much better ."
i didn &apos;t weigh this two years and this woman .
it feels great .
"i &apos;m not trying to have no more , quite what i do , and i feel like to be happy ."
"one third thing i learned -- had something that <unk> in the inner <unk> , &quot; about 15 , 14 , 250 , bulbs -- &quot; finger ."
we see the water coming .
"i said , &quot; please go into the air . &quot;"
i don &apos;t want to tell this thing to feed in 20 parts <unk> as expect it from transit .
"so while we <unk> , i had this feeling to die , it isn &apos;t more unpredictable ."
and almost like we &apos;re coming out in on that road .
but it was very sad .
"i didn &apos;t mean to go , i love ."
and that choice really seems really interesting to me that i just had one of the wishes .
"i only have a <unk> of self , i could see my children grow ."
"the second bus says one afternoon i went to a series of <unk> in my daughter -- <unk> , not much <unk> talent ."
"so , still not ."
and i <unk> to assume a very small child .
"and in the world , anything makes a sense of me ."
so i realized at that point what they &apos;re connected to the spots was that it was just about just being a <unk> father .
"more than all , anything , my only goal is to be a good father ."
i was <unk> down in that day not to die .
"and i got another gift that &apos;s a gift to the future , and go back and to life ."
"my call on all of the that flies today is : imagine the same thing <unk> on my flight -- please , please watch it , and how would you change ?"
what would they do was they &apos;re missing because they think they &apos;d be there for gone ?
how do you change your relationships and the negative energy that we can happen ?
"and more than anything else , are your best parents you only can be be ?"
thank you .
that kind of <unk> behind that closing is fairly simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build <unk> .
the most important post with lighting is the control sector in <unk> .
"the <unk> cafe details they see over there , who are <unk> ."
"now , in this case , we can pull out the systems for absolute energy to control what <unk> and noise , actually we can create a lot of difficulty with <unk> ."
"those gray chromosomes aren &apos;t running , but they &apos;re using a whole different technology ."
"but if we do it that as an an effective impact on a laptop <unk> that will be used by a functional body to pull that <unk> <unk> , then we are in the business ."
and that &apos;s planning behind <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> sequence .
"those small <unk> are currently placed in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> and the milk of the cursor -- <unk> , <unk> tokyo ."
"it &apos;s a warm story , right ?"
let &apos;s talk to you about how we found that .
"when we started our research to dry <unk> six months ago , it was entirely unknown to unknown what meaning and purpose of this space was ."
"the only thing we did was extremely , very complicated , <unk> <unk> part , just taking <unk> in the <unk> <unk> ."
"and it seemed to do something called these black <unk> , and this <unk> performance sounds like this ."
"now the planetary policy manifestation that , and we began with an area that we <unk> our surroundings to have known <unk> , and <unk> this fish series ."
and then something <unk> happened .
"<unk> as a <unk> that did not <unk> our cheese -- didn &apos;t like &quot; down <unk> , but didn &apos;t want to eat it ."
it didn &apos;t make meaning in my eye .
"and by looking at a different kind of &quot; t , i went to realize that that was a current office . &quot;"
it all ran towards a <unk> photograph .
"the <unk> <unk> is forming <unk> <unk> on the gray line , when a particular tank is discovered . in fact , even when that particular program trying to do it , which drives on the womb ."
"and if they don &apos;t , actually , do nothing ."
"so that really as a <unk> of <unk> and we started working on working , started who in almost around the , exciting thing , i thought , well , not what the goal is ."
"so we could say , for example , to an <unk> american power , or one <unk> in germany will be with cost ."
so we should understand better . so that its target is still .
so <unk> and we <unk> the code <unk> and found out that in two digital christians on the idea that they &apos;re in two digital shows -- a major and large big .
"and it <unk> too , for us , they were very active for methods that actually made all any technical <unk> information ."
they had so unpredictable bits and pieces that had to attack to them .
you guys would actually know the <unk> of the <unk> .
they knew anything .
"and as you &apos;ve been an <unk> that the reduction of hiv is complex and <unk> , let me give admin give me a science story ."
there &apos;s much more hate than anything we ever saw .
they see an <unk> from this graph from the code .
we &apos;re talking about -- this is about websites entrance .
pretty valid of what <unk> looks like .
and i want to tell you how we were able to get from this code .
"so what we <unk> again , we <unk> fever <unk> , because we know what to make these ?"
and then we got <unk> and we are <unk> and we tried to <unk> through this kind of thing in the real world -- with the mystery of real world .
and so we needed this goals data about this goals that we could find evidence from .
"in order to include these theories , what we call ourselves in memory is it definitely has a <unk> , which is all about <unk> goal and probably , roughly in iran , because most of the austria is accepted cities ."
"well , in this area , there aren &apos;t many thousands of goals ."
"this is basically bottom-up operating , engaging , and looking at <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> ."
"so i said to my favorite , &quot; well , i &apos;d have a list of experts for designers and new york services for me . &quot;"
"and i called her , and what i called it , what you know is to compare to do with the <unk> that we put in the code inside it and get them out to look in the data ."
and that worked very well .
"so , it had been possible to translate out in the simple digital media <unk> with the <unk> ."
"the <unk> basis is part of the <unk> , and that the black object you see ."
"and then you <unk> the speed of this <unk> , and you can actually actually run the weight into your pocket , and eventually , you can even leave the total <unk> ."
"and what we &apos;ve found is that the target of the chamber that it was actually slow and is kind of in only field -- clearly in trying to give another degree treatment , so you won &apos;t find the sensation going too quickly ."
the great digital <unk> -- we &apos;d made a talk by <unk> what we were <unk> and <unk> about .
"so for instance , the number is very popular somewhere out in that code ; you can &apos;t wear it ."
"i began with ethiopia to film scientific literature <unk> <unk> , and i also found this thing being built in <unk> , and found that they <unk> in so-called 1 air system , and each flight size field looks like <unk> ."
so it made sense . it could fit together .
and it has been better .
and those <unk> in iran are <unk> in iran .
and guess what if we found in <unk> ?
and you can take a <unk> structure .
"so again , that &apos;s really okay ."
and we had this big boots for us a little bit where we actually looked at that .
"well , don &apos;t understand me , that was just not so comfortable ."
these <unk> went through several weeks of hard work .
"and we used just fire to <unk> them to live in a <unk> , and we got to get through <unk> ."
"but then again we found that both digital carl in fact <unk> a in one or the same goal , but of various directions ."
"the little place <unk> and gives one <unk> so we left the sensors , and whatnot , and they combine to the kind of a long mechanism with six infrared <unk> to interact , and putting valves at the ministry of weight ."
"so , in lots of of stuff and <unk> , we &apos;re certainly very trivial to actually what the goal is ."
it &apos;s <unk> and it &apos;s only <unk> .
so we have to make sure that others of <unk> <unk> could come from <unk> .
now here &apos;s a really cool stuff that we discovered -- there &apos;s really made out of the <unk> .
"below the box is the box , and in a way you can see the <unk> ."
"well , what this kind of thing is that it builds the flower of wireless <unk> , like <unk> and proteins and <unk> -- and it also <unk> the code that stays still using the <unk> face , wrong data ."
"and in fact , the wrong data of <unk> is done before ."
"so it &apos;s exactly as in <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> with it very <unk> ."
"that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it true ."
the idea of this is <unk> not only with the <unk> <unk> of the jaw .
it &apos;s actually less dangerous and <unk> .
the idea is to announce a digital interface .
we need digital <unk> there where a human <unk> can &apos;t respond fast enough .
"so for instance , on the ground <unk> , if the great operating system gets to be very quickly you have to open up the electricity program <unk> ."
"of course , this can &apos;t go from the human <unk> ."
so this meeting is that we need digital <unk> .
"and if they &apos;re accurate , they can have really horrible stuff happening ."
power mouse goes back .
"and the <unk> , or the insurance , will notice it the milk ."
that &apos;s a bit scary .
"but it will , that &apos;s worse ."
and what i say now is very important .
think about it . that time is <unk> .
it &apos;s not to do particularly with <unk> <unk> .
"so , for example , it will grow up like that very well -- so in using a power machine or a project ."
it &apos;s ridiculous .
"and you don &apos;t have to -- as a perspectives , you have to see that we don &apos;t have to put the ink off on a <unk> , as we &apos;ve seen ."
so you could also use ordinary technology to distribution .
you need to reach it just as possible .
"and when you do it , you eventually get an <unk> <unk> ."
that &apos;s the director that we &apos;ve got to draw .
"so unfortunately , the biggest biggest policy is to do not protect complexity in the middle east ."
"they &apos;re in the united states , europe and japan ."
"so all these green areas , this is the biological environments ."
"we need to <unk> the consequences , we let do better step on ourselves ."
thank you .
i have a question .
"<unk> , there was a much of that that people reported , that <unk> the signature is behind the ground ."
is this your opinion ?
"okay , you really want to know ?"
yes . okay .
"but my focus is the <unk> , but the driving force is not israel , completely ."
so the result of this is <unk> plant .
"there are just one that , and that &apos;s the united states , who are it , you know , very fortunate ."
"because <unk> would be even bigger , even more ."
thank you for being a given <unk> . thank you <unk> .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years at the moment working myself in situations that usually is very difficult and at the same level that are on time .
"i went to jail , really hard ."
i &apos;ve tried on a college era -- dangerous .
i was <unk> ; and she was extraordinary and dangerous .
"and i &apos;ve been watching 20 30 days , nothing like that -- <unk> at a start , a slightly hard at the first -- very dangerous ."
"i have actually <unk> in the greatest part of my career in terms of <unk> situations and doing that on their dignity in <unk> <unk> systems so <unk> they &apos;re to study and sought to be and refer to a <unk> sensor , and an endangered way and <unk> for it ."
"so as i knew that i would come and <unk> this for that i was about <unk> the world from <unk> and <unk> , i knew that i had something a little different ."
some of you might have heard about that i &apos;ve took a <unk> out of jury at a couple of weeks ago .
"i would send some <unk> , some <unk> &apos;s , and i gave birth to the number one way i found that had <unk> on my tedtalk 2011 ."
"actually , some happy people and companies and train <unk> , held an <unk> opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris never &apos;s <unk> will -- the <unk> to get on the climate seat weren &apos;t facing one and she had somebody buffet ."
"and so the name was this : this is her name <unk> : my tedtalk , by <unk> who you have no idea what will be about the topic , and the wait one afterwards , 15 at the <unk> may be drew in your company when i did their business ."
but it &apos;s certainly a pretty nice chance .
"now , you know how many people put these viruses ?"
a bunch of them .
and this is just the <unk> .
"so despite these <unk> , i knew that anybody would buy their internet bills ."
"and if you asked me that century you , i couldn &apos;t have been able to tell you to do this with <unk> ."
"but the new project i work on are , my new film , we study the world &apos;s marketing , the maker ."
"as i said before , i <unk> through some cases in their events quite popular lines , but nothing could me suppose nothing is really so hard to talk to anything so embarrassing with these kinds of shoes and so amazing with those guys in a space ."
"you know , i got the <unk> for a movie ."
"what i want to do is a film <unk> about <unk> marketing , marketing centers , with the entire movie for worry between <unk> a causes of <unk> and advertising ."
and the film &apos;s &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &apos;s &quot; a box .
"and so what &apos;s happening in &quot; the old <unk> <unk> &quot; is that everything from above south alone is from the course of getting on at the end , was perfectly with brands -- from the <unk> you see in the movie , the brand new shot ."
"now this battery , the right <unk> <unk> to perfect circulation ."
these people will come <unk> with the movie that film would be connected for forever .
and that &apos;s going to actually take this film to you at this very idea -- this was what ?
i &apos;m a powerful person .
and that &apos;s more to post-conflict .
"it was written in <unk> , forever . &quot;"
"but not only won eternal <unk> , unless we get in <unk> , but we &apos;ll note we &apos;ll selling any given painting in the movie ."
"so we may sell a <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> those <unk> bag they &apos;ve ever used ."
"the opposite car you probably have <unk> from the <unk> dry junk and <unk> the toy <unk> after you &apos;ve ever had , a weep of &quot; for the &quot; the net . &quot;"
"so the idea is to show the point of that teenagers are the amount of life , are actually saying to you that film on universities ?"
"and we actually show all the route this working , how it works ."
the goal to clear with the whole range of twitter .
and you &apos;re going to see the whole thing through the vacation of the box .
"so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from end ."
"and i would look , that if <unk> would help this , i would <unk> this ."
"you know it &apos;s fun because when i heard about it , it &apos;s the lens for you ."
but i don &apos;t know how about <unk> people will be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use perspective because it has something negative <unk> -- but you know how that will evolve ?
how much money needs to get that bothered ?
and <unk> million .
"i think it &apos;s difficult to hit them , but i think it &apos;s value to anybody near familiar , some really familiar <unk> ."
"who knows , if the film comes out , we may see how a <unk> cluster ."
what do you believe how that the answer is ?
the answer will probably be <unk> no .
but it &apos;s a difficult thing about that <unk> -- or a difficult thing to do for me ?
<unk> : both .
so ... don &apos;t mean that minute .
"so , my <unk> , can you help me ? i need help ."
i can help .
okay .
pretty fine .
"we need solar cells , which audience symmetry ."
<unk> .
if you look at people at here at what they do with .
so we have some points of <unk> that we can turn to .
imagine the camera .
"and i thought , &quot; would you say , &quot; the camera would mean we had to have a <unk> ."
"it turns out that it &apos;s really mind , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do with the film nothing . &quot;"
"and just that disappeared , these companies so things came for the other ."
it was not but that important to do something about the film .
i was amazed .
they would have nothing to do with the project .
"and i was more confused because i thought that it was all the idea about creativity , your product &apos;s a product of how many people go as many people , it &apos;s so you can managed to go on so much as possible ."
"specifically in the world today , at this interface of new media and old media landscape -- it &apos;s not description , in this exciting way , the new research repository will bring out the number of the wonderful message ."
"no , so , the thing i thought was ."
"but let &apos;s do that , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and it was <unk> ."
"actually , just not as , it &apos;s not one of those errors ."
and they were not going to have any problem .
it would have been now .
"but what this picture is , you know , it &apos;s a problem ."
"look , if you &apos;re following transparency with the gene <unk> box it &apos;s -- this is one of the first pictures that it would appear ."
"i really like your kind of <unk> , <unk> <unk> . now ."
"but here was that problem : transparency -- <unk> from deception looking , simply <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- <unk> by <unk> and <unk> to access to information , particularly the most of the essential evening is all last aspect ."
"you know , we &apos;re in the next place at transparency ."
"our politicians say our president say this , even our best people say ."
"but if it <unk> you to <unk> , you know , something about it ."
"but why ? transparency is creative is terrified -- as this strange bear , who ended up still more secure ."
it &apos;s <unk> -- these strange stuff so pure graphics .
and she &apos;s a very delicate .
"what &apos;s 100,000 times in of time ?"
so we have a whole corn <unk> really <unk> .
this is very <unk> .
"so when i started talking to companies and told them that we wanted to tell up this story , they said &quot; no , we &apos;d want a story to bring a bit of story ."
"we want you to teach a story , but we only want most of the story to express our history . &quot;"
"and you see , when i was a child , and my dad went through the storm and here they woke up -- and she would look at me -- he says , &quot; but my son , there is in every three sentence ."
"there &apos;s the version , there &apos;s my version , which is , and you have the true version . &quot;"
"so you see with that film , we were calling the real version ."
"but , there was a company you only ready to help you -- and just for me because i &apos;ve been <unk> and richard <unk> for years -- i realized that i just had to move to england and the company on some <unk> ."
"so what you started to understand -- or what i started to do -- was , the realization , in the start talk to this companies , is understood the idea how your brand gets to the success problem ."
"i have friends to make big , giant <unk> , and i have friends to make , like i got that little <unk> ."
"and my friends , the great , <unk> <unk> , say that the reason that their movies are so successful is facing the paper , who they have ."
"and then , my friends , do little <unk> workers , like , let &apos;s then with these great , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;"
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
"so , how do we see <unk> as that movie ?"
"whenever i go on the way , and over all of the window , when i painted the <unk> , you &apos;ll see <unk> <unk> ."
"and each time i suggests someone , i can &apos;t say , &quot; are you enough for this interview ?"
do they encounter it ? you see slightly the me .
i want to help you like controlling yourself .
"so , maybe you were going to <unk> some of those in front of the reef . &quot;"
and then we offer one of these amazing fear .
"either inflation has won accounts , or the ministry of health care that are going to have the amount ."
"we &apos;re going to be <unk> for both men and women for female -- find <unk> , whatever ."
that &apos;s the <unk> .
now i can do all your questions and give them a <unk> car push .
we &apos;re even a stable brand .
"so as you &apos;ve been talking about the smaller films , we are seen as a brand ."
"so , we don &apos;t have a budget like others ."
"so what they do these things like -- you know , people are <unk> to <unk> -- that &apos;s kind of why we are interested ."
"in words , would you describe the original thought ?"
<unk> is <unk> .
that &apos;s really great question .
ms. <unk> billion power .
technology isn &apos;t the way to describe something that someone looks under the <unk> .
"we &apos;re talking about <unk> , fishing crises ."
"i think <unk> &quot; word &quot; is a really nice word that proposed to something i do about a positive , as opposed to &quot; <unk> smell . &quot;"
this 97 corner .
"how can we take them longer <unk> . we got useful , fresh fresh water , successful <unk> ."
so things have a kind of cool impact .
and this is a cloud .
what about me is that ? what about the corporate performance ?
"and i have to talk to you about this man in the streets who are like me , work ..."
you have something to tell me about my brand something .
how do you called your brand sensors ?
"<unk> , my brand ?"
i don &apos;t know .
i really like &quot; nice clothes . &quot;
"<unk> <unk> was computer tracking , didn &apos;t get out the world for <unk> ."
"so , what is the brand that <unk> ?"
unique .
"i think the <unk> , the <unk> i have , which i think <unk> glamour ."
"i like many black colors , lots of <unk> , and stuff like this ."
"but i usually always have a <unk> center , like testing , or a bike data <unk> , and such a waste ."
"if dan were to be a brand , he would be the gay snake in a little australian diamond ."
"and the brand is the name i &apos;m is , i &apos;d say , <unk> <unk> fly ."
"two -- partly of the grade , feelings in meaning , part of my book is not familiar to me ."
boy three : i am the <unk> .
so i had <unk> around the whole country in the world .
so i think that that &apos;s my brand .
"this is my brand of the little <unk> industry , <unk> industry ."
"<unk> : my brand &apos;s <unk> , because i was <unk> ."
"male : <unk> brand , <unk> <unk> ."
you know this ?
ron : i &apos;m a cop .
i &apos;m tom .
"now , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i often see a <unk> about the computer <unk> and it really <unk> ."
"and what &apos;s found , i needed a thomas conduct ."
i needed someone who could help in my mind could predict someone to really understand when they were called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
and this was what i found 1 -- called <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
"they have companies like <unk> , working <unk> , to find <unk> ."
if you could do it for which they could possibly help me to do it .
"they brought their photographs , you know ?"
i have this . the first picture is that i had a picture of my family .
tell me just a bit about how it &apos;s connected to your thoughts and emotion over if you think about yourself .
these are the people who are instinctively of trying .
tell me about the world from one .
"sorry about this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- like people around a <unk> , the family , as the family that lives , and as you care , the work ."
"and all these things come , and start from a place of me , and for me , and start from to nigeria in the west virginia ."
which is the next person to talk about them .
"next stuff , and this was my most beautiful day of living ."
"what &apos;s connection to the thought of yourself , and thoughts about them ?"
it is like me that i want to take .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are about guitar . i like weak pieces of stuff .
tell me why &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what do it make you do ?
what is the trigger ? in whatever <unk> are you now ?
"why is it important , huh ? what &apos;s the red ?"
teach me a little bit about this sort of .
so a little more about them burrow that don &apos;t you .
what more <unk> were gathering through ?
... none of that have to be scared . in which <unk> you &apos;re in this way ?
"<unk> ! &quot; no , thank you ."
thank you very much for your <unk> .
that . . <unk> .
"yes , i don &apos;t know what <unk> this is going to look forward ."
and they went done quite some crazy stuff .
"and the first thing i saw , is that their skills had two lights down and though their pipes have spoken pages -- the profound off is a <unk> <unk> ."
the <unk> very well .
"and i think there &apos;s almost an effect with it , anywhere ."
"and i think some companies will feel only to focus on , rather than both ."
"lots of companies tend to -- and that &apos;s human nature -- do not avoid <unk> and not <unk> these are <unk> , these elements , and they <unk> that <unk> , and they and they transform in a <unk> in a somewhat <unk> problem ."
what other brands are doing so ?
"the first is an classic , apple ."
"and you can see it there , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ."
"now , there are some collective brands , common brands that come together , who come and going to go , but a feedback printer , <unk> , a really strong thing ."
"a <unk> , <unk> &apos;s <unk> brand . what is your brand about ?"
"somebody ask them to describe their target models , their greatest <unk> , how do they have ?"
you &apos;re an <unk> ? do you drop that in five minutes into the <unk> ?
or are they some more a big <unk> ?
"are you some those , that &apos;s not a bit <unk> , there we &apos;re <unk> ?"
"<unk> are things that are <unk> to are <unk> like <unk> &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and audio and <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> to market ."
or are you on a change like the <unk> ?
are they dispersed and <unk> of <unk> like <unk> ?
"are they <unk> , traditional , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ."
"are they <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , king , sacred , <unk> , <unk> like that dalai lama ?"
"throughout the media sector , we had more than 500 companies that were free and <unk> and the &quot; no &quot; we said , &quot; because they &apos;re not going to be part of the project ."
"they were asking not to do full of things with that film , because they weren &apos;t control , no control over the surface ."
"but it goes to 17 <unk> who were ready to control those trucks , to do something with people of which the higher food and <unk> like me , and eventually where we would ultimately come to each other , and we would would usually have spoken stories -- <unk> ."
"and they calculated , the history of the classroom to tell us the story that the clip we &apos;d tell at least five days , is the size of the brain are used to create both <unk> and write to scientifically movies ."
"we drove <unk> to the <unk> , where <unk> had been <unk> ."
"throughout the city , you know , it was 12 years as five years since it was <unk> ; there &apos;s no <unk> , nothing ."
"and we drove into business groups , where companies , they &apos;ve <unk> their path towards trouble , in all your war ."
"now the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i gave <unk> specifically the way or where i organized a success , those are the one i &apos;m talking to things where to do the case these things ."
"and that is what they did , they do ."
"because you put in the <unk> , you <unk> the <unk> , and you know that maybe believes , business intelligence didn &apos;t really have your sense ."
i &apos;m going to move the artists to interact with .
"i &apos;ll work with him and create something different , to make people think to the framework that we &apos;d do is we think the view of the actual way ."
and how did they have it ? what did it successfully ?
"well , since the movie arose to the garden festival plan . so we can look at the french ."
"the <unk> <unk> on january , <unk> , and then -- that &apos;s not even when there &apos;s 10 times -- needed 8 million accidents from this movie ."
it actually contains just one time about two percent .
"that &apos;s just online -- don &apos;t waste , no television ."
the film didn &apos;t come even weeks .
it doesn &apos;t yet have it online . it &apos;s not <unk> .
he still came out of the other places .
"well , finally , the film has a very enormous amount of choice ."
and this is not bad for a project that almost each <unk> in which we organization agreed with spoke to their clients that lay finger in some earlier .
"what i really are really saying is that if you compare to <unk> your single <unk> , risks that you &apos;re being able to fit in these numbers ."
"i believe when you waste , you give them closer ."
"i believe that if you exercise it to help you to avoid risks , you &apos;ve all prepared for all of them to be a profit ."
i feel like we need to mobilize <unk> people .
"we need to make people argue , not fear to have <unk> of opportunity ."
"in the buddhist <unk> , we should welcome the fear ."
we ought to keep the signs in this <unk> .
leader <unk> for the importance . say the <unk> .
"60 <unk> large <unk> , so we will welcome the risk ."
"and finally , we should hearts we welcome ."
"and these days as i tend to , we &apos;re going to bring a bit out of honesty ."
"and that &apos;s , sort of : honesty and transparency , my <unk> phrase , &quot; transparency , &quot; becomes transparency of <unk> from my good friends that have <unk> advantage for ebay ."
"the big data is going to create in the entire world , different opportunities ."
<unk> <unk> : &quot; she welcome transparency . &quot;
thank you .
"now , &quot; <unk> , the name of transparency , so what did on $ eight ?"
and this is the great question .
"i <unk> in my house , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of western <unk> , the <unk> island -- for a $ <unk> going source series to attack my research center last year ."
my name is <unk> .
"for 18 months cultures i took nothing different from the title , and i got to deal with a basic , convenient and also , my work tube , that &#91; i &#93; was here , am &#93; internet ."
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> at happiest gains and stories that i can tell you with 17 very interesting <unk> elements of nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the presentation .
there &apos;s a lot of narratives over why we &apos;ve done that .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and doesn &apos;t tell education .
i grew up in india .
"i grew up an amazing education -- not for me , &quot; i didn &apos;t cook mozart , but i had no access to <unk> and i had no access to all that ."
"when i was traveling , and to end these <unk> , i started to learn a lot ."
"and during course , during both of google , i tried to do this hall -- i started making art information with technology ."
"so we opened a team , a great girl , and we started to get a team ."
"i &apos;m probably going to begin to explore some <unk> , and tell you some interesting things that had been advanced , since <unk> ."
so we just turn into <unk> spin .
you can just look around all of these <unk> .
"so , it &apos;s the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the van <unk> ."
"and i actually get to one of my favorite , the natural sea museum in new york ."
you &apos;re coming down for two . you guys &apos;re very simple .
"<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in the museum ."
"it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- <unk> , <unk> , it doesn &apos;t make a difference ."
you go around and you &apos;re people getting <unk> .
you want to get your museum in the museum ?
"open your card . walk it , ignore the signals ."
"in afghanistan they are , they like , from the end of the performance ."
that &apos;s like a lot .
freeze them .
"and thank you , i want the best one ."
so i &apos;m a story and a <unk> by my senior <unk> in <unk> .
i see this play pattern wood .
"if the museum give us an image , note on this ."
this is one of the images of pollen .
this is all fascinating .
"you know , those of you that are really interested in art , there &apos;s a click here -- but i &apos;m just <unk> ."
this is one of the pictures we put actions into what &apos;s called <unk> .
"for example , this picture has about 10 billion bucks i believe ."
"and a lot of people say , &quot; what are you going to say about 10 billion <unk> ? &quot;"
and i &apos;ll show you that now .
you can bring in very easy and .
this is a funny guy that &apos;s <unk> .
"i love this guy , his term &apos;s atheist ."
but then they really want to live deep .
and so i started play around and i found that there &apos;s something about .
"and i thought , &quot; well , you know , that sounds interesting . &quot;"
"i was going back to college , and i slow down to realize that those kids actually put in this together ."
"i <unk> a little round , had some known about the <unk> early needle , actually i discovered -- this some of the start of a concept called <unk> , a <unk> stock <unk> on a arm &apos;s <unk> ."
so it seemed to be a quite <unk> .
"and i don &apos;t know why they did and i learned about it , but i learned something about it ."
"you know , you can really go to the floor anymore to pull back in ."
"just to give you the view , i &apos;m going to see what it &apos;s going to do ."
"and here we were , and this is the painting ."
the best part comes more -- now in a second .
let &apos;s fast you <unk> <unk> and jump into new york .
"one other part of me , i like <unk> ."
"for example , using reason to find the detail ."
but what if you want to see the online data ?
"and what &apos;s just when you &apos;re going to see van , how van <unk> did this <unk> come ?"
"you go in , you really get to your place ."
"i &apos;m going to spend an image of my <unk> with this image , until i &apos;d to really be a memory ."
"this is <unk> , ever , never seen before ."
now i will give you my <unk> function .
"there are plenty of other than that , but i must <unk> at times ."
"this is really a cool part , he &apos;s called <unk> ."
"every one of you , every -- whether or poor or poor , is you have a great house -- is no matter ."
"you can create disorders and the churches based on your own -- and of all those points , you can form your own collection title ."
"simply , you get down , and i created this , is the power of this -- <unk> , you can delete it ."
it &apos;s &apos; the <unk> in &apos; the <unk> .
"they start using all these , send their friends , so they started a <unk> about what they feel when they &apos;re that fear ."
"i think <unk> , <unk> , is about the fine science that all the wonderful things can &apos;t come from google ."
they are coming from my favorites anyway .
maybe i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that &apos;s an experience with humility for me .
"i mean , i hope that we can just put in this digital media kind of -- and i &apos;m on it critical online ."
and the biggest question i have is already asked about : &quot; do you have taken this to an experience of a picture ? &quot;
the answer to that it is no .
it shall have the experience .
so that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
"and it &apos;s a picture of your brain , your brain <unk> in two <unk> ."
"this is a half , which is the <unk> side , and then the right half is the <unk> site ."
"if we could have a <unk> to <unk> every hemisphere to the <unk> , we may -- we might turn your brain ."
"for example , what that was anyone who is completely obvious ."
that would be somebody who &apos;s completely meaningful .
"now , where would you have a brain on that measure a scale ?"
"so some of us may have decided for one of those trials , but i think that for most of the people in the middle of the audiences , your brain and something like this -- with a high proportion of neurons that was in both this way ."
it &apos;s not like that they &apos;re both the <unk> or something like this .
they can make meaning and naked .
"and so i can actually see as one of the people , full of the number of those meetings , which need a good resource capacity to deliver the complex ideas together ."
but at the same time we take a lot of <unk> it to actually wrap the experiments .
now how do we grow this <unk> <unk> ? well we love it with things .
"so we go out and play it , and we &apos;ll then fall into it and then get out of it . and then we &apos;re just doing our whale ."
"basically , do the same thing ."
well one of the <unk> you &apos;ve evolved over years will probably be one that only at the same time can be at their business at all at this point .
"i mean it can sounds really interesting about <unk> just one thing around three day , but they were born with this idea of an idea they were born ."
i remember looking at a kid in the play on a lion .
"he was another great company , and he didn &apos;t get very well in there , and he immediately went all the way ."
"but i think it brings the game that learning to experiment with one very valuable lesson , which is why they don &apos;t just go <unk> , and essentially bear the math at one other ."
"and this is a robust <unk> model in the world , that way we don &apos;t interviewed it ."
"it would be a far more expensive model for nothing because they &apos;re dealing with <unk> complex , but it &apos;s with those very little sexual particles ."
"and then as they play with their things , they <unk> all sorts of things -- how they fly straight by walls , or that they can be in one of the same place at two different areas ."
"and so they all sold out tops the hamburger <unk> , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics ."
"this was the <unk> that physics couple a month ago , but it gave you <unk> tolerance to describe mass protein ."
but what they didn &apos;t take about the great objects around us .
"and it &apos;s not just as a party , and it might just like , because i don &apos;t either play with particles ."
"well , i sometimes play with you , but i don &apos;t very often ."
and i never heard it before .
"i mean , no one has ever seen particles ."
"but my hand back , it didn &apos;t like it ."
"because if all things of <unk> and all these things are implications to the rules of interactions , then maybe simply not would aside the rules of quantum mechanics ?"
i don &apos;t see why that should not be like this .
"so i would feel more excited with the whole thing , when we could somehow <unk> in basic terms of these kinds of mechanics , even rules of what the result of quantum mechanics ."
so i took myself back some days a couple of years ago of doing this .
i had an <unk> .
and that &apos;s the first object you can see in your set of crap .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a it &apos;s a vast computers .
and you can see that green issue there in the middle .
it &apos;s the kind of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about now .
this is a photograph of an object .
i just study something . we &apos;re looking here at the center .
and there &apos;s really a very large <unk> of this small piece of piece .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a small piece of metal like a wall . it &apos;s about the fishing <unk> and there &apos;s over the big blob .
so i did that thing as sort of running an app for the computer .
"i went through a clean space with new treatment , and rescued to about 50 hours of them ."
"so , the last bit , i had to work on visualizing my own machine -- to get this sort of very low concrete hole and get to obtain the whole thing ."
"this thing has a piece that has to be into its <unk> <unk> , but it takes a little help to do it so ."
looking at all of these items ?
you know how <unk> it &apos;s ready to be in a full <unk> ?
"i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all sorts of different things , but then the way that people go the hand and i hear those things , because i don &apos;t want to find them , not , right , request out ."
and so quantum mechanics tells that fundamental objects were all as that same way .
"the <unk> for any range of objects are not just human , but the light that seems to be on , and the wind , when the wind gets left in giving it from the air ."
"and so we knew that if we wanted to see this thing , the metal takes along of metal , we needed to cut out all the strings outside ."
"and then , that &apos;s what we did ."
"we were <unk> this light off , we made it up into a <unk> <unk> , and goes out it near nearly until it , its lowest <unk> to been being open and nearly , to keep the piece of <unk> as well ."
so we &apos;ve measured its movement .
we found that it really jumps .
"instead , i think it &apos;s silent , just trying to <unk> it . so the way it was in sort of <unk> of , like one out there -- picking up , <unk> and making bone in thing ."
"in the <unk> , we gave it a little engineer group , we were able to <unk> it to the same time and <unk> it with something -- something which is crucial in quantum mechanics ."
so what i &apos;m saying to you is the real <unk> .
what does it mean for an object to move towards <unk> and not ?
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all of the atoms from the <unk> from which it &apos;s statistically quiet and around there are have part of that passage the same atoms and in comparison .
and they <unk> sensitive states to <unk> themselves .
and the rest of the time is <unk> .
"and that means that each tiles are and at the same time of four different environments , which is <unk> that every single piece of food is on two different places ."
i think that is really cool .
really .
"now , i started getting over all this year into the calcium space , because you see the traffic between one side of the dog <unk> and that metal image is about over the piece about the cow and it , and was about metal ."
"so if one <unk> can be the same amount of time at two different <unk> in them , as few different places , piece of movements can be on my class , why does not have you ?"
"and i mean , this is just what my most pissed off ."
"so , imagine that you would like then have been a mainland , just about several locations , ok ?"
and how would your consciousness <unk> about that in the room is <unk> ?
there &apos;s another aspect about history .
"if we &apos;ve been cutting it into the <unk> side of the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , we found that it was always in one piece ."
"and so i had to develop these new procedures that it looks like this was actually the objects in the very <unk> in which , actually <unk> objects along in a small space ."
you hear a lot about talks about how quantum mechanics is because all connects to everything is related to everything .
"now , that &apos;s not very widespread ."
there &apos;s a bias far beyond that . you go to even look larger .
"it is that these connections , the connections with all the things themselves , literally being chosen by who it is the interior , and this is the <unk> and weird ."
thank you .
"in half today , i decided we should think way , how we make cooperation happen about commercial development ."
"it should be our goal , if you think you think about it , where family works and work , and they want to learn to <unk> in <unk> , you have this governance of different cities that everybody agrees in social <unk> new studies ."
"so , let &apos;s face a far away from that goal ."
there &apos;s a billion people in developed developing countries that there isn &apos;t even one city making them disappear .
but the amazing thing about the cities is that they &apos;re so much more value than they &apos;re building it into a building .
"so we could think , like , too , rather than many of the <unk> of new cities , perhaps for the world ."
"now it sounds more <unk> about it , well they &apos;ve never <unk> with all over new cities ."
"and for these , they just base them generate , you know , the rooms built from cities ."
imagine the half of the people who are in new shops want to meet this ; the half are not yet yet .
you couldn &apos;t try to expand your capacity to fold in a <unk> .
"but you know where you were avoiding high in those communities and your own <unk> , <unk> , against free and by waste ."
so it &apos;s moving very hard to work into the <unk> of these spectrum .
"but you could go to a completely new place , a completely new zealand form , it would carry some type of products that would be building and not reaching them anymore ."
"i set up to ensure that governments are doing new surfaces , who should contribute enough to a city , and had a name on <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"and then later , as i found that , to think about all the time , and biologists and <unk> , they thought about that by <unk> in the mail was done on a day and perhaps , you know ."
"they knew , every year over <unk> , they were stopped talking about their land where they came into the u.s. and they were heading for laramie to <unk> the people can stay in their citizens , <unk> the same thing ."
"this one of our morning , she <unk> the game says , &quot; in fact , if we have a moved of land of our country &apos;s region , if we just give you one row , to go away to the happiest message , and what user will have the ability to work starts &quot; governments here ,"
"in all 15 january , english judge <unk> suffer as a fellow <unk> ."
"and in the next standard elections , won <unk> <unk> center in a press &apos;s online , so that open up and even <unk> had increased ."
"he responds to <unk> , to his terrorist <unk> man ."
"in front of mind , i worked an <unk> talk in <unk> ."
"they &apos;re keeping by <unk> , and trying to fill from <unk> , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this tool as <unk> spaces for putting numbers on the principle ."
"the first one is <unk> the importance of law , laws that you already cannot care <unk> ."
"we &apos;re willing to give new technologies to that capital account for technology that means of it and laws , and the laws , it is just in the same terms that we would approach to the ultimately ."
"in the tomorrow morning the boy with seawater , they sent a link to the church ."
"again , he <unk> signed ."
they were actually getting me from them .
"and he said , &quot; let &apos;s present that from our country it . &quot;"
"so , we met in december of december <unk> at a <unk> ."
"i &apos;ve tried to do so far , and they &apos;re very <unk> , such as much as because they are present ."
"and i &apos;ve been used this paradox to start a domain of <unk> in a very place called new york , think they &apos;re starting a place in some cases under a dollar a half of 22 dollars ."
"but it was a really <unk> debate , made by a theme of a point when it said , &quot; paul might come &quot; guy , we might be looking for a tedtalk . &quot;"
"so that jane &amp; <unk> form , i think that there &apos;s a very simple city , a place as a beginning of <unk> country , an extension industry , <unk> <unk> and <unk> that humans have the possibility of relationships nor may be performing or much person ."
"so i came asked to talk about <unk> to why that this project was going to have chosen to the way that that it is important to bring what we in the way , and allow that this country is where we turn our country to ."
"so , i was asked to come up first , and to think in the fourth and , five <unk> would consider it ."
"so i ended up keeping on another <unk> presentation , a pattern such as a <unk> as that has tried to acknowledge that if you want to actually create a lot about value in a city , it has to be a big city ."
that is a picture of the city that took villages and the <unk> is seeking the new authorities built that gone into 60s .
and anyway the very person of those airport has a piece of 100 killed .
"so i &apos;ve been trying to <unk> the <unk> of this , if you want to build a new city , you have to start at least 1,000 times about 1,000 reserves ."
that &apos;s more than a $ 250 morning .
easy to physicians have investment .
the faces of the audience really seriously and pays .
"the lecture presentation of congress came to stage and told me , &quot; professor <unk> , thanks to you <unk> for your talk , but maybe maybe we might look at the talk ."
i have him up here in my laptop . &quot;
"so i turned myself , now and they gave up the tedtalk <unk> ."
"and i <unk> to the internet engineers , the new city turned this new opportunities to people ."
"there would be the way of living in a city that was held in <unk> , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north ."
and it &apos;s a new city where you <unk> new possibilities for leaders .
"<unk> <unk> government were better on our <unk> , <unk> and they could change any one of their <unk> that &apos;s on <unk> radio for these <unk> and measuring that they would get <unk> for that nobody is actually capable that <unk> <unk> ."
and the insight by president <unk> was that the <unk> of the progression that i was thinking were about being an <unk> to show up for that town to see the city could pull up to build market any clue for violence in knowledge and a lot of time .
we &apos;ve gone across an area .
this image is from this place .
it operated like <unk> thousand miles .
"and after that , on the early january , you &apos;ve <unk> it with congress on a change the patient &apos;s relative to have a decrease for <unk> <unk> that &apos;s for specific <unk> ."
"you know , in a <unk> crisis that has just reached behind congress , in which congress has been <unk> for her being a voice of <unk> ."
"all <unk> , all <unk> society , <unk> doing that ."
"to become a part of the constitution , but twice is you &apos;re going to live <unk> ."
"on the 17th <unk> , the day it was <unk> with 85 <unk> to a <unk> board ."
"immediately after that choice between increasing and <unk> , a number of living 500 the one is about 60 different layers of the world who are most interested in most of the war <unk> in <unk> water ."
one place is south korea .
"this is a picture of a major , new <unk> training built in south <unk> developed war <unk> <unk> injuries ."
"all you see in this picture was underway at four years of having taken off every six years , when it &apos;s made four years to get them <unk> ."
the place which was very popular in <unk> is <unk> .
you have two cities that have been raised to chile and the third is in <unk> .
"so , if you like to really think about that , it &apos;s where we &apos;re today ."
"you &apos;ve already got it , and you already missed that land for the second city ."
"already from that , though , it &apos;s going to be done on a law that allows anybody to <unk> and also &apos;s the largest <unk> of effective rights ."
and she &apos;s a country being given demanding the software that &apos;s equivalent to offer for the model of the atmosphere of transit system .
and also raising interest and developing things are very troubled .
they actually bring an funding to it .
"what you &apos;ve already known is been doing already got <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> ."
"there are lots of stones who are being in america that would take place to be stuck in a place with some animal <unk> , and there are lots of people who would like to live in there ."
"all over the world has about over 3,000 million people , by years , that they love you to live with some <unk> with one of the other part ."
one million people leave one year and across the united states .
"all of you are guys who are deserves to train their families to come out and move , sometimes they get <unk> <unk> to give expensive mothers to get clothes and own clothes ."
"unfortunately , sometimes the kids spend the sometimes trying to find their parents to exist , in some cases , from a decade ."
"so what about an idea is to think about , <unk> into <unk> to build one new city ?"
"or even building students out from your cities , or hundreds of the world spread around over them ?"
so what about this idea that it shows that every family has a choice between millions of towns around there that are all new events to put together for <unk> ?
and this is an idea where it &apos;s worth <unk> .
"i ask my friends from street <unk> , to say thank <unk> ."
do you know how many choices are you making in a typical day ?
you know how many decisions they make up in a typical piece of week ?
"i have been taking a forecast <unk> factory based on 2,000 <unk> , and the average number of decisions in one day is a <unk> in a day ."
"<unk> was actually <unk> recently a study of <unk> in which they &apos;d <unk> for a long time , if you saw that factory <unk> ."
"and these scientists just speaker have <unk> these major subjects problems that appear unexpected always when they were creating choices in to do this , and then of course , to come back with thinking about the issues ."
and they were finding that a restless <unk> failed themselves with some tool .
"each of these themes is , of course , many , many common decisions ."
50 percent of your decisions have been given between nine or less .
"just for about 12 percent of their decisions , they <unk> for an hour or more of their time ."
think about your own choices .
"do you how many choices make you worthwhile by the nine minutes an hour of particular category , in the <unk> article ?"
"so how good , do you think of what they are there to <unk> ?"
"today i want to talk to about one of the biggest <unk> of our modern time , the printing revolution ."
i &apos;m going to talk about the problem with some problems that are going about .
"now , if i &apos;m talking about that problem , i &apos;ll ask you some questions , and i &apos;d like to know your answers ."
"so if i ask you a question , raise your driver , because i &apos;m blind , just if you would burn a bunch of a cows ."
"but , anyway , i ask you , if i &apos;m a question , and she is yes , so my first question is : is , today is you &apos;re going to listen to the <unk> of the books ?"
thank you .
"when i got to mit <unk> at stanford university , i actually went to that very <unk> center , at least he really was <unk> at night ."
"and it was the store which went , <unk> ."
"and this business , it &apos;s nearly as a teacher ."
"they had 250 types of chemical and less worth of side and over about 500 different types of <unk> and <unk> and a more than two dozen species of water , so far more than we had actually a lot of <unk> in life ."
"i have <unk> it down to this business , but at a particular point , i said , oh how does it actually never be doing something or anything else ?"
here &apos;s the olive gang .
"you had over 75 <unk> pacific <unk> , <unk> <unk> that had being outside to gather a thousand years from the <unk> <unk> ."
"so i went to visit the council someday , and i asked the <unk> , &quot; the process works , that works the way you buy all those options ? &quot;"
and he showed the <unk> on <unk> &apos;s food and it would come in with use these conversations as well .
"we decided to take an experiment in business , and we took our <unk> figure out ."
here you are looking at have <unk> .
they had <unk> different species of <unk> .
we made a little data directly to the guards out the <unk> right there .
"we had six different <unk> of urban locations and 24 or 24 <unk> parts in 24 other layers of digging on <unk> , and you &apos;re looking at two things : first , which thought , we &apos;d stay more and be more courageous or trying to get <unk> ?"
"there are more people left when it was 24 to 60 percent when they were six , about 40 percent ."
"and after that , we would like to design what the humans &apos;d rather buy , <unk> trash for this product ."
now we looked at the infected effect .
"but from the people who were there when they were 24 , literally they were bought a glass of <unk> ."
"from the people who are there as a six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually had a <unk> <unk> ."
"well if you would buy it , medicine on six times the six times they would paid off on the light , &quot; when you had six people <unk> , when they had a <unk> ."
"now , to go to not buy a glass that &apos;s a huge thing for us -- in most of our kitchen food -- but it turns out that this allows us to influence us with very much more <unk> thinking ."
and we don &apos;t decide to decide unless our own best interests is about our own best interest .
so with the theme of this day : save the concern .
"i &apos;m going to describe to you now , what i &apos;ve just been trying to have a study , with <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we make the choices for the <unk> for almost about a million <unk> plans by new patients all the country ."
and what we &apos;re doing is it &apos;s that number of energy . the numbers that had this kind of show that you could get a fraction of a national plan that will be saved more than it tomorrow .
"and we discovered , in fact , there was a thing in act ."
"and in these contexts , we had about <unk> plans for the people who had anything between 13 and after dictators combined <unk> ."
"and what we found was that the expected are ever trained , that , in fact , in <unk> to hiv-positive ."
"if you look at the <unk> that were taking plans that have two participants fund classes , had a supplies in college students -- still do not so much like we want ."
"but using the plans that divide almost donation we took , there &apos;s about the <unk> came into flight ."
"now it turns out even if you &apos;re <unk> , when you were on time you got to 2.0 , your mind , once you could have <unk> influenced by it , for more negative consequences ."
"this is the <unk> people foundation which decided to decide , like less <unk> , which the more possibilities that they followed them now , the more <unk> they would carry to <unk> and support ."
"the more of the opportunity put <unk> , that you have <unk> them all the money in <unk> ."
no ph.d. made to make the extreme decisions that someone from people who were <unk> when their muscle has remained more <unk> .
"well , last people , in the last <unk> of different consequences , we &apos;ve yet seen about 20 <unk> aspects that offer each other and more choice with support ."
it <unk> that new lifestyle -- <unk> them when it &apos;s a best interest instead .
"they differ more of worse making worse collapse , worse potential and daily aid ."
they prefer to be more to the matter of things that <unk> themselves much longer feel at nature .
"the reason for this reason is that perhaps we <unk> these <unk> of enormous <unk> , mobile heads of <unk> , expensive molecule , <unk> and emotion , but we can &apos;t <unk> , and we can actually show one of the little bit taken off our neighbor ."
so what i would suggest today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve built various different ways of various issues -- they &apos;re just <unk> them in their business .
first year : to just higher .
"they had heard it before , but it was never true by now , ever that it was less than today ."
"people are always raped when i say , &quot; <unk> . &quot;"
and they &apos;re always concerned you &apos;re losing over .
"but that seems , the truth we see it about more , and more , that if you &apos;re ready to just <unk> and the <unk> speed of being going to be shown , well , that it &apos;s going to come from <unk> and coalition in recorded , and spend in way , be how country , but"
"and as it goes back to <unk> , the different <unk> and the <unk> species of 26 to 15 <unk> , it goes the <unk> level of meat by about 10 percent ."
"when the <unk> earthquake would <unk> their 10 percent of the worst <unk> , <unk> them that the profits that a profit to vote of only random -- a result of both <unk> over the <unk> of a level and higher costs ."
"you know , the average global health today , <unk> about it they they 1,000 products ."
"it is a typical <unk> that allowed you using 100,000 products today ."
"but the danish supercomputer <unk> the world today is <unk> of the world , and they &apos;re only using complicated products -- a way of the amount of autism in the mouth telescope ."
"so in the world &apos;s future , i think one of the best examples that <unk> sell to market some of the is , as you &apos;re just getting to the choice in my lifetime , something finite this is a vaccine , which is a program ."
every single staff discussed her had now most sophisticated text with one <unk> .
"early biologists who want to meet gap , about 20 companies that aren &apos;t laid down -- not 300 or more fund ."
"you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to identify it ."
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
"and the first i get the employees is , &quot; i tell you how the possibilities is different from each other ."
"and if their employees don &apos;t stack it , they can &apos;t . &quot;"
"well , before we have <unk> <unk> , i &apos;d had a conversation with cognitive sauce ."
and explained that he had to have been willing to give <unk> a home <unk> on the world &apos;s most <unk> street screen view .
here is the description of the road .
and i want to read to you that .
"and now , i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read and ask it to clapping , and if you &apos;re ready to take henry &apos;s <unk> ."
okay . anyone &apos;s <unk> gary &apos;s <unk> coming down .
did they all ?
"okay , let me show you something a little more ."
"they knew it was a trick of it , right ?"
"well , who is ready for that trip ."
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
it is great .
"the fact that you could see is <unk> of at the first time <unk> information , when the second world , but i would think the cost of that most surprising feeling about the possibility that they actually thought it ."
because they had <unk> films made it we might feel too .
"what drives me the other day that tries to help you with the one problem of healing , this is the capacity of god ."
"that &apos;s where people must understand the difference between ways becomes , the implications of the importance , what the consequences are associated with the potential for paying <unk> <unk> and ambition ."
why is they &apos;re giving people 15 to 30 percent more than they use an accident or friend reference being a friend or a permanent basis -- in a ...
"because it doesn &apos;t feel money , they feel expensive ."
and it turns out that if you go to it that it feels like something is very great tool for you to save people more .
"so in one study i made up with an office and into <unk> study , we made a study with people in <unk> &apos; <unk> -- voice to everyone <unk> -- and those of all in them were all in their own <unk> studies in them by their hospital ."
"and while at this meeting , we have <unk> them in exactly as much as they had just been , we have a <unk> system ."
the <unk> we have had on hand was that we had asked people to just think out the things in a <unk> of things that would happen if they were to save money .
"so in which we finished this easy thing , there was a increase of prevention by 20 percent , and you got one increase in a number of people who were willing to save , one <unk> and for four percent of the volume of cancer ."
the third thing is creativity .
we can deal with more actors than we can doing things more response .
"so here &apos;s for instance , a study that we did in a <unk> space ."
"it turns out , in the broad curtains in the organic coal , and down in the american site , goes to support the number of forms of <unk> occurred to <unk> miles ."
but do you know what ?
"if i get me <unk> magazines , and they just share him between 10 categories or i &apos;ll show them fish and i believe it feels for me <unk> about you and i announced a better arguer that i have giving you for more than i paid 400 them ."
because <unk> tell me how i feel apart .
and so here are two different <unk> .
one &apos;s called &quot; jazz and &quot; and others &quot; poetry &quot; that way .
"now if you think that the left ad is dedicated to the <unk> that , and the ad &apos;s on the right , you put them into hands ."
"okay , there &apos;s a few ."
"if you think that that &apos;s on the left side , and that i like , on the right side , you <unk> up ."
okay . now a let &apos;s look like what .
now it turns out they &apos;ve got accurate .
"the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is tethered , but you know , what ?"
this is a very <unk> <unk> .
"the panicked have to go missing something , not all the foundation ."
"and the problem is , often when you look at the entire lists of all of these guys ."
who will you like that to take a <unk> ?
my fourth technology : <unk> tale of complexity .
"it turns out we can <unk> our information in reality as we think is , to simply simplify them ."
we need to increase complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll give you an example of what i mean .
"so let &apos;s take a really , really <unk> decision : the buy of a car ."
and here &apos;s a <unk> that puts that there &apos;s a company to do a car completely supported you .
you have to make different choices to create your car completely .
now these funds change in the number of choices that deliver them in <unk> .
"you know , shameless of the car -- i have <unk> choices ."
"motors , <unk> -- four different options ."
and what i &apos;m doing now is to figure out the order of the decisions arise .
"half of the clients goes from a lot of opportunities to reach out , to the local methods , four <unk> ."
"and the <unk> of customers are <unk> to their causes given four needed , four choices in <unk> , many opportunities ."
what do i watch alumni ?
as you are interested as annoying .
"if you use that <unk> all the money on all the decisions , that &apos;s called it to be a <unk> in my way that , i &apos;m too 7 ."
"what they find out is that people get us from the <unk> all over the separation movement and on the <unk> , would send this off ."
we lose it .
"come from the little choices to the many , join them into it ."
it &apos;s same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
now the only thing i &apos;ve done is to happen to changed the order of these information by its point .
when i play with a simple kind of &quot; start out how i grew my laundry .
"even though the <unk> <unk> the retina , nothing about my self-esteem about the watch of the ticket will still help me on them ."
"it also <unk> me towards the great product that i created , and i am willing to follow myself the importance ."
let me conclude on the one .
"i <unk> telling you of four techniques that even <unk> the <unk> problem -- will <unk> the financial energy costs -- make that sound -- are doing real -- let you &apos;re <unk> up less <unk> by degree , just complexity and less ."
"any of those techniques i have designed to do today is to help them toward the opportunities -- the good for them , they can take them for themselves , good for people you for the service ."
because i think the key to the best thing is that you &apos;re given on the shape <unk> .
"and the more we <unk> them into the their <unk> , the better we &apos;ll be able to be able to practice art ."
thank you .
"<unk> . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> on youtube , my <unk> ."
that &apos;s true .
"today we want to talk about how videos are <unk> , and then , but coming out of what all is going to do ."
"we all want stars to be stars -- four , animal , early -- and as a young , i &apos;d been a young sense , the such as powerful to that ."
"but knowing that all of us are from , because , we can all therefore , all of our creative insight , ethnic away , in one part of the culture of our world ."
every single one of you may be popular for the internet to next <unk> .
"but given fact , over 16 hours and 48 hours , they were <unk> up by for them off ."
"and again , <unk> has ever been members and <unk> learning by thousands of times , and this is how to be cultural hammer ."
so how does that work ?
"three things : <unk> , <unk> and unexpected ."
well we want it .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god .
stop food .
<unk> -- oops !
"last year , <unk> <unk> photographed this video that he <unk> by his house in the countryside ."
"in 2010 , it had been taken 23 million times ."
"and the theme of that graph , as it looked as the video for the first years ."
"this actually didn &apos;t want to do simulation video , actually ."
he just wanted to share with one simple parts .
because you do that when you &apos;re actually important to a extended big mountain .
he had to raise a lot of <unk> uploaded .
and this is actually this video had been photographed in january <unk> .
what &apos;s there ?
so 45 / <unk> <unk> .
"jimmy <unk> the cover , the <unk> then made the video for the one first ."
because <unk> like heart <unk> are asking us new and interesting things : and a great audience to see them .
"<unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> : hunt <unk> <unk> <unk> toward <unk> -- <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , her <unk> <unk> <unk> you would not spoken ."
anil release goal is one of the <unk> video of all this time .
so it was almost by <unk> million .
so this is what the graph looks like .
"you know , as the point of <unk> <unk> the <unk> , it seems like that &apos;s not far to be pretty much at the big ."
"so , what happened on this day ?"
"well it was tedx , that &apos;s right ."
"if you know , your <unk> -- those other honey are even <unk> ."
"but what about that day , that particular friday ?"
"well , <unk> <unk> had walking , a lot of the <unk> started writing about it ."
michael <unk> did a lot of <unk> theater at <unk> was one of the first things that ran on twitter .
the important thing is that a spontaneous <unk> group of activities come from a standpoint of a whole audience with <unk> <unk> and <unk> the process .
"then this community set by people that shared <unk> , and then <unk> back to talking about this crowd ."
"now there are 10,000 <unk> of youtube <unk> ."
"already in the first seven days , there was a marketplace for every single community ."
"unlike the kobe lost transition in the 20th century is the possibilities of our sort of way into this phenomenon -- either by <unk> it , to come from it ."
now &quot; <unk> &quot; is animation and music in tahrir <unk> .
"it &apos;s just , very , right ."
this year it was nearly 50 million times earlier .
"and if you don &apos;t think it &apos;s really mad , what you &apos;re expecting a <unk> , for example , four million ."
actually cats are looking at the video .
cats look at cats who <unk> on the same video .
"important is , the know that creativity in the southeast oceans are <unk> ."
there was <unk> .
anybody made a <unk> version of that .
and that has been international .
all of this <unk> of it built from the ground to a mess that kind of stuff that &apos;s kind of right &apos;s a joke to anything we &apos;re all able to participate .
"today , we &apos;re not just going to get molecular mechanics into something , we &apos;re doing something ."
who could have this what could they do ?
"who had <unk> <unk> , &quot; or zipcar , stone , little <unk> cells ?"
"so , what <unk> might write you for things that <unk> about ?"
"if in one world where your five years will add up to pitch two days , it only can only go through and <unk> <unk> like the speaker told it what i &apos;ve talked about ."
i &apos;m not because i was most fun when i told a friend to see me that little video with me about the <unk> <unk> of philip after cave for <unk> funding .
i got a traffic <unk> because i haven &apos;t <unk> on the top of <unk> but often there &apos;s a <unk> tube that leave a <unk> on the boat .
"now , while that was just so much surprising and <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> to get for eight million years watching ."
and that determined in a process of all that we do radically .
and that makes us it a big question ...
so what does this mean ?
<unk> .
what does this mean ?
"<unk> , creative literacy , the 18 , the <unk> are <unk> of a new type of media and culture , who each access has access to everything and in the audience ."
"as i said , one of the most volatile stars that simultaneously -- <unk> <unk> , would be his early on there at youtube ."
no one needs to give ideas green light .
and today we all feel as symbol of great artificial culture .
"and these are not the major people of the old media , and they often hit the media on today , but they &apos;re going to <unk> the conversation of the future ."
thank you .
"how do i talk about 10 minutes more about the bond between men , and just how amazing his <unk> image of <unk> in the world was <unk> as she has , as they were three years ago and within national mother and her native daughters , five percent of her limb and five centuries afterwards ."
the story is not even over .
"it &apos;s a massive puzzle , it &apos;s still <unk> ."
i want to share some of the online community on the <unk> .
and you think the first piece is : a man who <unk> its <unk> .
"he &apos;s a <unk> , a writer , a man whose entire life was getting this entire awesome hope of <unk> and freedom of its home ."
"now remember , in <unk> min &apos;s way listening was <unk> <unk> , how to act , the <unk> turned for his alive was for a single <unk> <unk> ."
"the words , as long as his friends , even <unk> ."
he pulled back into silence .
"he died , losing through history ."
he is my grandfather .
i &apos;ve never heard him personally .
but our lives are as much more than our lives .
my grandmother hasn &apos;t <unk> his own lives .
"i had to make it really hard to think , and it was my way to learn that the story <unk> were happy , it was going to take you out of it , but let me go out ."
the next <unk> shows how that same boat in the early drought was quietly a plant portion of sea .
"my mother may was 18 , as her father died in an astonishing marriage , already with two little girls ."
"but they had a task for it as their food , and they &apos;d been a new family at australia ."
and it was something completely <unk> to <unk> .
after a <unk> and freezing chest <unk> <unk> a boat to hang upon when <unk> was eating <unk> .
all the adults were aware of computers .
"the best fear was giving them <unk> , <unk> and death ."
"so in fact , most adults put up their mother had little to follow over my mother ."
"if if this wedding <unk> , my sister would have just given my sister and turn it back on , to my grandmother ."
"my first <unk> are out of that boat -- the upper <unk> of an <unk> from the driving <unk> nectar at every wave , mountain and empty ."
"i don &apos;t remember the teacher that came many times , but <unk> from the <unk> of men on our boat , walked outside of it , or on the landing family condition , off the rock , my two hours did not want to work ."
"but i remember the lights out of the shores of the <unk> , and during the young man , who <unk> , and had died , the end of the trip toward him was too much for me and the first <unk> about the player of a infected <unk> ."
no apple has ever <unk> back .
"after three months into australia , we flew together in a camp ."
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations following together to build a new people together .
"we let a fool in <unk> , one of the <unk> real <unk> , <unk> <unk> whose population is quite <unk> ."
"but after the mixed census agent their existence , police past had ever done in love , we didn &apos;t want <unk> in <unk> ."
the landscapes that went from the <unk> came out of the rest of the world .
"and the silk were <unk> by the ideas they were associated with where there was one thing , <unk> them ."
"my mom worked on corn covered in a <unk> satellite , per <unk> , six days , divided <unk> ."
they used to always find what trouble around -- is walking and musical people .
we were poor .
"every dollar has been <unk> and was given to <unk> as english , and math , in relation to what we needed to go to do -- most of all the new things that had always come from , always from &#93; make hand ."
two half <unk> medicine to make every single facility in the tree .
"another arm was <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to rich in the poor years ."
"and you had the rare but <unk> <unk> from being the &quot; &quot; and here , &quot; <unk> , &quot; point : &quot; walk home . &quot;"
"after all , for where ?"
that little sort of <unk> up .
"and there was a meeting company with the <unk> and a touch crash said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go off behind them . &quot;"
"my mother , and daniel and i made <unk> in the same bed ."
"my mom was a dog every night , but we told each of them about our day , to follow the movements of our grandmother into my own house ."
my mother suffering the <unk> from his boat .
and it was my job to stay parent every night with everybody to get your <unk> so i could cut down it .
"they made a computer work , then a standard company , and they took a store and had a waste ."
"and the women worked with their stories over guys that didn &apos;t scale towards <unk> and <unk> , and women , <unk> kids , literally determined two worlds ."
<unk> and <unk> have been <unk> .
efforts got us into flow .
i lived in <unk> .
"and i was in one last artist , <unk> <unk> student , <unk> hit himself ."
"so the other thing i did at this was in town in <unk> from the <unk> <unk> of violence , and i had been <unk> the chief of water that was <unk> ."
but it got the way that it comes back up years .
"and this following year , i was set up in the <unk> of the <unk> of the year from the young <unk> ."
and i was taken by a <unk> message to the next <unk> and <unk> taniyama didn &apos;t .
"<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> by <unk> , was now broken through refugee , refugee <unk> to come from to describe them , the battle of which she had never heard of , and in <unk> , being an outside ever selected ."
i did not really be familiar with arguments .
i didn &apos;t know how to use this <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about clothes .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
"i &apos;d looked back to your <unk> <unk> , and a joke -- a grandmother and two daughters , her breath till three years , and so <unk> studio , during the day , sitting together and white , we would just report by three to her stories and the <unk> ."
"i told my mother , i would not ."
they partly figured that i was as old as they were doing when the boat <unk> down .
no so no one had been the opportunity .
"&quot; do it easy , &quot; she said , &quot; she did not be , what you don &apos;t aren &apos;t . &quot;"
"so i spoke about <unk> and training , and the questions of anonymous and <unk> ."
"and i was talking about , that more ."
"i met people in all mothers like so many of you , the of them people did what they loved , was where they lived events of the outside of the ride ."
"and yet , even though i received to an degree i realized that i couldn &apos;t suggest me in a career election ."
there was another <unk> of artifacts .
"and i realized at the same time that this is all right , it &apos;s a steady <unk> to try and <unk> in the picture , not just here -- not just all right , but something you &apos;ve got to be grateful , maybe a dolphin ."
"because as kindness can lead , you can cause an failure to scale by cause people to do so that they held up the limitations of the environment ."
"i have 27 enough losing textbooks so that <unk> the world , only to move it at the way ."
possibilities that weren &apos;t allowed for itself was <unk> get also <unk> .
"there was a bigger matter there , an <unk> optimism , an strange measure of humility and to transfer ."
so i was <unk> of my spaces .
so let me play a small team from people to the period that <unk> does not go from a very challenging challenge .
so long hour we had no bowl .
"and finally , i am a similar <unk> soup of lol that we shared ."
and we worked at the night late .
"and most of our ideas were crazy , but we were some sort of naive to get away , and we managed to just get the <unk> ."
i &apos;ve met a decision to pull out to the united states .
as it goes away so .
my angels that go back .
"three months later , i was moved broke , and an adventure further turned on ."
"before i lecture to myself , i want to tell you from my grandmother ."
she grew up at a time in the <unk> the social arms and police open democratic laws were the most important person .
life was not changed for centuries .
her father died months briefly after they were born .
she turned her mother alone .
"at 17 , she got another woman calls his mother , who was sitting ."
"without her aristotle you failed to a <unk> by preparing him <unk> and hitting him in her case , and with a larger election teacher , when he name himself won ."
"&quot; isn &apos;t going to be a said , &quot; oops . &quot;"
"i would take a database in a <unk> hospital , when she died , 1,000 miles away a street in northern <unk> ."
"i would look up by the paper , and i looked on the other side ."
"i knew she went , to make sure ."
my mother called me a girl for a couple of minutes to work .
"a few days later , we walked in a locally in <unk> and walked into their computers ."
we were telling stories and we would tell them we were still for them .
"to talk to <unk> , <unk> came around and said , he must end up with a straight <unk> ."
my mom asked us to <unk> your hand .
"they said , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of your own is so cold ? &quot;"
"&quot; because she &apos;s <unk> out since the morning , &quot; he said , &quot;"
&quot; you don &apos;t have the <unk> . &quot;
"if you put a band in your family , it will land through the women ."
"that you look to who we were <unk> , and we can actually see this as life , we can see that the men who could be turned out in our lives , we had <unk> ourselves in their lives ."
the christmas industry would have been too easy .
so now i &apos;d like like to have my own kids and think of the boat .
where would it ever be one wish ?
"yeah , i was afraid of <unk> if <unk> to make action ."
"can i give you a <unk> <unk> in your life , the <unk> &apos;s ingredients that <unk> the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , to the public , which doesn &apos;t write that variation there ?"
i don &apos;t know .
"but if i could give this and you long speed , i would do that ."
"also , collaborator , <unk> is mother in the fourth , or fifth <unk> ."
i &apos;m here to share with my photography .
is this photography at all ?
"that &apos;s , of course , image you can burn with your camera ."
"and still as an interest in me , when i received my first camera , but when i was 15 years old ."
"so i had to draw through this background through my prior song , but it was a bit different , because the camera was actually going to use research , rather than being in cooking ."
"and as you have to walk through a camera , along the process of putting it , leave place when you &apos;re carrying on that <unk> ."
"so , i seemed to hold on photography , to be a real place in the right time ."
i thought that anybody could .
"so i wanted to do something else , something which starts when that particular process starts <unk> ."
photos like this : a operating table along a lot <unk> street .
but it has an unexpected pull .
"and yet , anyway , a <unk> layer ."
"or photos of those -- <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but all by our shared desire to keep a practical level ."
"when i say reality , i <unk> my toy ."
"because , of course they are not something they really can ever sentence , but i would like to take that look much , like you could have , in a photograph ."
pictures you need to be able to stay around that trick .
so it &apos;s a really <unk> thought about when a moment .
but what is the trick that make it looks rather physically ?
about the detail or the colors ?
how about light ?
so what has the illusion ?
sometimes the kind of theme in that record is wrong .
"however , it happens in the same direction that we measure the world , and how they can go set out in a surface <unk> space ."
"it &apos;s not about what <unk> is , but what we think it &apos;s more accurate ."
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i look at the reality here when you can take all various pieces <unk> and took them out to create a structure of choice .
and let me give you just some sense of the simple example .
we have three <unk> physical objects that we all recognize in a landscape .
but in a certain kind of combined process they can create a work that looks more <unk> than whether there could exist .
"but at all , we know that it &apos;s not possible ."
"so we kind of turning on the brains , because our brains really don &apos;t show us that it wasn &apos;t really the really power ."
and i have the same process using photos in detail .
"you know , it &apos;s just about gathering through various different insight ."
"the things that are normal , what i think it &apos;s a curious picture of what we don &apos;t think about , things about how things do compassion we get around in our daily minds ."
"but if we tap photos , it &apos;s really important to think about the minds , because you &apos;re just kind of near something or something ."
"so , i &apos;d say that there &apos;s three simple rules to treat education to make an longevity result ."
"as you can see , it &apos;s not an latest images ."
"but connect them up , we can create things like this ."
"the first rule is that , close photographs should have the same perspective ."
the second is it is : <unk> photos .
and these two images can run by each of them by the same height as they were drawing off .
"three things will be doing that except for different , where the individual images begin to start by just <unk> them ."
power can &apos;t be <unk> to tell you how the photo was actually active .
"so by <unk> color and circle by contrast by the <unk> of <unk> , putting <unk> <unk> <unk> scaling together as square , <unk> color , color , we will <unk> the boundaries of those of the various pictures and just take a dolphin of typical image ."
here &apos;s another picture .
"you may think that this is just a <unk> , and the bottom part was <unk> ."
"this picture is actually completely <unk> off photos , shots of different places ."
"i personally think it &apos;s just easier to create a place , especially than seeing a place , because you have to have a doctor interacting with ideas in your head ."
but it requires much cooking .
"and when i had the idea of winter , i knew that , i would need several months to <unk> them to find the different places about the <unk> ."
"for example , the fish had been taken from a village <unk> , just ."
the shore is from a different place .
the main volume comes from a team <unk> .
"and yes , i even started the house on the installations of the <unk> by red ."
"and to make sure the cognitive outcomes , it <unk> from me to cooking ."
"i always start with <unk> , and i have a idea ."
"afterwards , it &apos;s about the combination of different images ."
and there &apos;s the kind of one now very neat .
"and then in order to make nice process , the result can be quite a very realistic , and it &apos;s also very difficult to <unk> ."
"so it &apos;s all kinds of tools , and the only thing that put together is this self is our imagination ."
thank you .
so i would like to suggest to you about how many electronic <unk> partnerships hit .
and i think that the biggest thing the thing is that we stopped talking with our patients to talk .
and one of the things we &apos;ve found before the <unk> went we was to an <unk> .
"not well this is actually in the process that you &apos;re doing with an african coffee , putting out , your family , the families , homes , family <unk> , &quot; how wrong the cardiovascular ?"
how can we help ? &quot;
"and we think we want to think that this is one of the main reasons , why all , maybe most of the shapes are needed : because we didn &apos;t stop more analysis ."
this is my favorite piece . it &apos;s very simple thing .
she has a <unk> on . / ever .
and i &apos;m having tomorrow seat .
"and yeah , i have a job as you might recognize ."
i have my task in 95 pounds of <unk> .
"the <unk> thing is : he does all over this period , when i put it in legal , it <unk> my data after google ."
"and they also be able to <unk> on my &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; so he can realize my vision of , yet not only to put myself in the moment that i need <unk> or for -- it &apos;s a display in the past ."
but there is something else .
"maybe that is a familiar thing : i &apos;ve spread over 4,000 <unk> across twitter ."
"so the next morning , i came to my business or talk to people , just as i &apos;re sitting in the car , my business room , &quot; for <unk> just a little <unk> today , <unk> . &quot;"
"but this is the <unk> , which can happen because this <unk> is actually off what to do , <unk> in helping patients to use patient pretend that it is more possible or may not be the patient transplant ."
"however , there is also any sort of kind of being <unk> people from their <unk> , and put them to playing some kind of play , to do anything , to control your health or the health of at doing ."
a student eight times comes <unk> .
they will give you this little text line where they agree on your iphone or anything .
and it will be able to measure the people taking the home from your house to send it to their physician and meet it by with other words for about something more than 100 dollars .
"there are the patients coming into a game , you can &apos;t do the control , captain took us again , <unk> of its own ship , but can help help we risk of business challenges our goals , and <unk> as and exchange and <unk> demand ."
"well , make them the only trains and do the situation they leave with two to share patients in the team ."
"and you can do this kind of discovery , but also with <unk> ."
"and one of the things we do want , i want to share with you through a short video ."
we all have layers <unk> into our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where everyone was going around in order to <unk> space .
we know one thing in which all of these is just <unk> .
and sure we can find <unk> .
but where if this is the next <unk> to help this patient ?
"we &apos;ve got time , we have milk , and nobody knows it ."
nobody knew where the next psychological <unk> was at a moment .
"so , what did we do ? we &apos;ve done things with <unk> ."
"we brought up a website and we asked it a huge drive , if you see an elbow where he &apos;s standing , you &apos;ll like , &quot; because sometimes you &apos;re there , natural . &quot;"
"and we had over 10,000 cups , data <unk> around cars ."
the next step was to try to find applications .
and we &apos;ve done a video of power scale .
"we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> source , expanded divide to find that high-speed action ."
"and if you &apos;re in a city like art &apos;s shoes and someone , you can use your iphone , and the next weeks you can now bring your head to get your child movements and the next <unk> to do is saving lives ."
"and instead of now , as we wanted to do this , we don &apos;t know , we would just run up , as this piece of product as bubble ."
and we want to get that on a global scale .
"and we provide our colleagues for all the world from others in helping , to help us behave like <unk> that might convert them to <unk> in the world ."
"and if they &apos;re on <unk> and there are somebody else to go , have their own <unk> or anybody who is able to find something like this ."
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies do help us all over the world helping us with all these nuclear defense .
"these could be more <unk> , or for example , just to make sure that the <unk> is still in a <unk> ."
"please , please get you for thinking about the health of isn &apos;t just to improve in the seats ."
thank you .
"now , i will tell to evidence of technology ."
i work in suburban <unk> .
and my little <unk> wanted we to deliver some environmental research .
... <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
and here &apos;s an quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
oh . my right now .
it might be <unk> until it &apos;s <unk> .
"now , we get this simple from going to -- we &apos;ll just leave through a video ."
no .
this isn &apos;t ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
"oh , my time has been over here ."
ok . thank you very much .
"so a couple of years ago , i &apos;ve set a program around the stars and design to get a year and into a <unk> map that &apos;s most so definitely with whatever they &apos;re operating in government ."
"well , the program for <unk> code , and it &apos;s a little bit like the <unk> network ."
"we choose every single year , several <unk> , and we play them on red roofs ."
rather than put them into the newly sending them into the <unk> .
"and they developed just fantastic apps , working with jewish individuals ."
but what they really do today is showing up what is because technology is possible .
so they do a child <unk> .
<unk> is a <unk> in the city of boston .
"so here it looks like he is looking for a drug machine , but that &apos;s the plot of <unk> , somebody who is <unk> it , while he &apos;s in bell , he doesn &apos;t really know very well in the baseball debt when he <unk> ."
how did he look for these particular things while looking for help ?
we had this baby last year &apos;s team from industrial <unk> in boston with this and code for better program .
"they were there in the bush war , and it was last 15 food teacher <unk> back ."
and they realized the city never put up the city fire on it .
"but a courageous <unk> , a man called <unk> <unk> , got a different <unk> and so that it was that the <unk> threw out the <unk> <unk> right out right back underneath these bits ."
"so he did what all big <unk> there would do , he wrote an app ."
this is a good word where you could have a fire electricity .
you <unk> too much hour unless you go .
"if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first <unk> <unk> ."
when you don &apos;t . you can get somebody out .
"so , they have a nice little <unk> set ."
this is a <unk> little app .
"it &apos;s probably the major translator , who <unk> adopted the umbrella of the country last year ."
but she does something you do not do it .
so it moves growing discussion .
"this guy around the <unk> of the city who saw the benefit of the city that he could use that app , is not for snow , but so <unk> <unk> ."
"it &apos;s pretty important to keep these bars , but people <unk> up the batteries ."
and he &apos;s getting the citizens to watch them .
and then white park decided that had to use the app to get the citizens to <unk> their senses .
and chicago <unk> you to ensure people when it runs together .
and we &apos;re already familiar with nine cities capable of using that app .
"and she has <unk> all the foundations , <unk> , of course ."
when you know what the song is there that you don &apos;t usually do that .
the <unk> project of software takes you in which usually gets a few years .
"so , we had a team working last year working in this project in boston that got five and a half sometimes an inch ."
and it was about a way to display by the parents can try to replace the public schools for their children .
"and afterward , we had tell us that , as it would have been wrong with the usual <unk> basis for about two million dollars , it would have cost over two million dollars ."
and that &apos;s nothing else yet .
"now there &apos;s a project right now in the structural orchestra , which have been provided by two billion dollars for making up , and it doesn &apos;t work ."
"and the wisdom of us , that is how it actually is there with anyone ."
"so an app that &apos;s written in a few days took , and then spreading off <unk> is a sort of <unk> on the present center in this area where government is in ."
"it <unk> how to work better -- not for almost more like <unk> companies , like many people think that she should ."
"and everybody goes like a internet , rather than like the internet itself ."
"and this means free public service , it &apos;s open and productive ."
and that is important .
"but more importantly on that app that al being presented to be a global problem that &apos;s a way that has to achieve government -- not as the problem in a meaningful institution , not as a problem of <unk> ."
"and this is a very good <unk> , because it turns out we are very good at <unk> with digital technology ."
now there &apos;s a great community of guys that do things we need to build to type and we need things that evolved in common .
"it &apos;s not just &quot; code for julie means &quot; dough , &quot; there &apos;s hundreds of people living over the country for spending open and <unk> write every day in their own communities ."
they didn &apos;t have <unk> the government .
"they &apos;re cognitively <unk> , but they <unk> , they &apos;re not carrying it , you <unk> ."
and these people know something that we lose from the eyes .
"and that &apos;s then if you &apos;re all your feelings about policy and the behind the <unk> tops and the other things we &apos;re doing is nuclear , government is really natural to teach ourselves in the 1800 , and trust what we don &apos;t do it in it , &quot;"
"today , a lot of people had been giving up with government ."
"and if you are one of those people , i keep you <unk> about it , because the thing going to change ."
politics isn &apos;t moving ; the government is in transformation .
"and because the customer ultimately sent out of our power , <unk> of us , &quot; do we think people ? &quot; ... how to think about that what &apos;s going on ."
and i didn &apos;t know much about government people when i started the program .
"and so , how many people , i thought this was going to face the government , mostly to have people who did so at caltech ."
"now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the last that putting particularly at all , <unk> for you going to work on <unk> ."
this is the loss of service and information .
what you typically come out and when you move into your city .
"if you ever have a chance to work in the community that &apos;s john <unk> have , like obama &apos;s red kid &apos;s red bird -- in fact , did all of you will seen this -- will be saying that by allowing people to talk about 200 theories ."
so scott gets this cover .
he called <unk> called the database .
and he didn &apos;t have the idea . it <unk> .
"and then finally , he says , &quot; look , you can just open up all the doors in your house and play very bad music and see if it &apos;s all the <unk> ? &quot;"
and this worked . this worked for saw scott .
but that didn &apos;t do the end of the bicycle .
boston did not just have a <unk> scale .
"it &apos;s that <unk> app , it has <unk> health and <unk> , <unk> it called &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> ."
we &apos;ve <unk> it <unk> .
this is a really smart driver at the office of the new urban crisis .
"this day -- that &apos;s an original report that &apos;s in it , like &quot; <unk> <unk> in my pocket -- cannot tell someone <unk> to keep you ."
how are i getting it away ? &quot;
but what happened with to end up <unk> is that different .
scott <unk> &apos;s notion of being man .
"but for &quot; you know , &quot; all the western &quot; is everything that everybody is in the way ."
"and in that case , it saw <unk> ."
"and the next thing we got was <unk> , &quot; i went around there , i found the card rooms there began behind it ."
do <unk> ? yes ? <unk> .
"and turned the <unk> on , night ."
"good night -- oops , a <unk> . &quot;"
pretty simple .
this is great . here &apos;s the digital right off the physical .
and there is also a good example of being able to get that by <unk> in this .
but it &apos;s also a <unk> example of the government as a platform .
"and i mean , i &apos;m not necessarily mind to an extended definition of platform ."
i think i &apos;m going to talk about something that &apos;s a vaccine is about <unk> with people ourselves and help people from it .
"a poor victory helped a lot of citizens , but government got this challenging ."
it <unk> these two people .
"and you could have <unk> them to the government access to the foundations if that was needed , but a <unk> gets a serious money to the needed to government and acquire widely intelligent service ."
"and if we do a <unk> of others , we will <unk> our communities ."
"now let &apos;s <unk> if we can , it costs lots of money ."
"and one of the most important things , we have to think about it is that no government is just a <unk> as politics ."
"and most people do understand that , but they think that it &apos;s one to be different ."
that our system is blind to the system .
"so how often have we ethical laws -- and sometimes we use a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we &apos;ll go back and we expect it to them that government <unk> and our <unk> action has make our needs , and then , society has a lot ."
"this is because the government is as a opposite ocean , and policy that &apos;s the prevalence of savings processing ."
and what is below it is that what we call accountability .
and we &apos;re using the word of <unk> one in the process .
"but it &apos;s this <unk> that you have this issue that we have , for we have , for whom we pay , is something that &apos;s working against us , something else , and then we fall together ."
people seem to think politics are sexy .
"if we want your institution to work , we have to make genes ."
because it &apos;s where the actual physics is making up .
we need to get involved in the <unk> of government .
so the <unk> used to be done .
have you seen those guys ?
"it &apos;s a set of prisoners in <unk> english who wrote a very surprising mission , writing a answer to the shores of popular learning field ."
that &apos;s not necessarily being politically . that &apos;s more active .
"now for sales of us , the government have given up , our time is to be thinking about the world we &apos;re just leaving our children ."
you have to visualize the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
"really <unk> that we did what we &apos;re required to do without improving the institution that can make all happen to happen , that could matter from all of us ?"
and the sector is absolutely necessary but the civil needs to be done .
the good news is that technology will make a possible sense that the government that is clearly able to bring progression to the odds in a way that it could achieve their society .
"and there &apos;s a generation that went around digital beach and it does not know which it &apos;s not so hard to do things , you need to go to just first up systems ."
"well , in the inspiration <unk> our face , and so i &apos;m infinite , i &apos;m only off , almost far a generation from it , of you ."
this is the generation that grew up without seeing your voice as full of of course .
"they don &apos;t <unk> that fight , which we all willing to speak to who is to talk ; they all give you ."
"they can take a look into their opinion , to every breath , and they do it ."
"so if they &apos;re facing the problem of government in terms of the problem , they don &apos;t care about using their voices ."
they use their hands .
"they use their hands , to write applications , which shape <unk> labor ."
and these apps produce our hands for improve our communities .
"that could be to feed a fire , put a box away , a lamp with a bag for a <unk> college <unk> ."
"and it just , we might have lost it at all together and come back and a lot of people do this ."
"but these apps are like little digital <unk> that we &apos;re not just <unk> , and we &apos;re not only the politician of the government who are cut signs and <unk> vehicle ."
we &apos;re more than we are citizens .
"and we will not better improve the government , until we get the true rights ."
"so the question i have for all of you here : if it comes to the great , important thing that we need to do together , everyone together , we &apos;ll be one number of sound , or will we &apos;re going to be a bit of it all ?"
thank you .
"usually my role of studying the people of like beautiful the new technologies we see are at the speed of wood , and i was thinking north here to me than that one , i &apos;d be really kind of spiritual , and i would also try to try and try and look back how much understand what i"
"i &apos;ll start with very much , <unk> to a single picture ."
"so , you know , just a little bit of <unk> ."
this is a slide that i <unk> from my phrase .
"so it &apos;s not the detail in my privilege , but in actual kind of general sort of bond it ."
so this slide shows us this analysis to the performance of insight from space mutations compared to the performance of a long-term channel that matters .
"what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like business , as <unk> us , something we often <unk> into our field , a kind of curve on a <unk> curve ."
"in other words , voice of course here is a <unk> in the world , <unk> ."
and this is a design that we have to use this large scale at magnetic field of technology in this area .
something very valid happening here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about .
so if you can remove the lights again .
"but some music object is that a second , you know , i &apos;ll paint something in this ."
"now , why do we draw <unk> in technology on fundamental curves ?"
"the reason is that when i started drawing on an normal curve , where if we say , that &apos;s the years of being in , so the 50th way , and that &apos;s an event that i want to show you as an <unk> <unk> as story ."
so you look at it .
and we don &apos;t tell you the much nothing .
"now if i &apos;m pushing a <unk> technology , let &apos;s say again , we would take a mass of sea , then on the <unk> , we would <unk> it for a <unk> line ."
"but when it has done something like this , it actually changes the <unk> of causing things ."
"so if <unk> to stress <unk> as much as the <unk> <unk> , then we could go into a <unk> and go in 30 seconds we were in <unk> ."
but this is not so fast .
"and that there was never had before in history of the pure part , this kind of frozen growth , which is <unk> by which the same has set up all years ."
"now , the question that i want to ask you ? if you look at these curves , you don &apos;t get to over and continue ."
it &apos;s not possible that everything always always breaks forever as you start to go off .
there &apos;s two opportunities .
"either of this is an psychological mass of like this , it &apos;s about something that is <unk> down very , <unk> , or it becomes the next time for this ."
that &apos;s just about one .
"now i &apos;m a yes , i think i used to actually happen to this in the way the this is happening ."
"is that real mean , that &apos;s what this means . we &apos;re in the dawn right right now in a quantum transition ."
"we are in this line to which of 1994 , our world will recognize a new way of the world ."
"so the question i &apos;d like to ask , and i think instead of myself is how these new world might be ?"
"what is this new state , which is the world creating it slow ?"
"because the <unk> seems to be very , very obvious if you are in part of that inside ."
"one time i was a child had that the future that was over there 1994 , and people often talked about what would happen back in 2000 ."
"now we have a conference here where people are talking about the future , and they <unk> that the future is still at 2000 ."
"on <unk> this , we don &apos;t go ."
"so in other words , the future is <unk> by a year i &apos;m in the world for every year ."
i think the reason to do is realize there &apos;s some what you are going on .
the transition will happen . we can feel all of it .
"and we know that in the moment it &apos;s just not a power of is trying to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because that it &apos;s all so different , a <unk> of what we do , a little bit simply do not ."
"so what i just want to talk about to what it might be like , what i get really about is ."
"so to do that i &apos;m going to have to talk about some else , that actually have nothing with technology or the computers ."
"because i think we really understand that to really understand , we have to take a step back and look at the thing at a affordable cell company ."
and i want to look at this most of the <unk> of the world in the region .
i think the importance is to make sense of practice . &quot;
"and so we return , and for billions of years -- this is a big , huge , <unk> <unk> , with many plastic chemicals in that ."
when you look at the same way that chemicals were organized and then you &apos;re kind of a good image of the <unk> process how it <unk> the <unk> to pass .
"i think there also have theories that start <unk> like everything started , but i will tell you one emotional story to tell you that the time time leads , 10 feet of natural <unk> , materials of <unk> chemicals ."
"some of these severe no particular sorts of chemicals , which it , that allows them to actually turning other chemicals from carbon dioxide and grow ."
everybody <unk> that one are starting to be <unk> .
these tiny oil &apos;s oil in the senses were <unk> the bottom symmetry .
"however , just but those 8,000 participation were <unk> -- especially one of those supermassive parents were only one of them , green density ."
"and every time it turns out , the amount of producing disorders is around something like a matter of energy ."
so each event was much different .
"in fact , the energy vessels that received one such chemical robot as nothing and <unk> for other than other , and more with two chemicals were about <unk> years ."
"so that we feel that they survive to take longer , and they lay to their own quality feet ; they kill their behavior molecules on <unk> ."
"so this is a very simple chemical shape of life , but really interesting is saving when those , when these bell step was about <unk> ."
"there &apos;s some sort of understanding that we don &apos;t have to understand the <unk> , the ability to live information ?"
"they learned to <unk> the prescription our status of information as information . if that we call in certain chemical form , what you call dna ."
"in other words , she found a conscious way if you had to predict what allowed you , <unk> <unk> you to run out that information and has been able to <unk> you out ."
and the real thing about this is that this thing happened to shifting diversity across the time of <unk> billion years of a little revolution that it was <unk> up right ?
"in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , the same code and the same code ."
every forms use the same pictures that <unk> percent of the same code .
we are worried that we &apos;re just the scene ourselves created in this code .
and i had a hundred <unk> of zero <unk> today that i would go to airports fashion designers that i am trying to do .
this is -- what i &apos;ve done is i created this code -- that &apos;s for normal letters that we use in the imaging basis -- and i &apos;ve written my wake up of a piece of dna device and i wrote that there was 10 22 <unk> and a 22 <unk> .
"so if any 100 million copies of my <unk> , i &apos;ve got enough for everyone in this room , and it &apos;s in the world right of everyone , and it &apos;s just here ."
"i would have been a <unk> use of birth , and i would have written it on a virus and some <unk> in this room ."
so what &apos;s the next step in ?
and that <unk> parts of dna was a interesting step .
and the fabric did these cells -- that took her happy for another kilometer .
"but then another one . there was very different stage when things were completely different , which i started to communicate these cells to communicate and products in which , and that way communities &apos;ve really generated by cells ."
"you know i don &apos;t know if you knew it , but bacteria can actually symmetrical their dna ."
this is also the reason that the <unk> is to grow antibiotics .
"some of bacteria found that from an within the tens of thousands of these organisms , and then they have together these information together with other bacteria , and we now have a lot of bacteria that are correlated with <unk> , because we communicate bacteria ."
"this transportation managers causes that for reasons , which were on the same boat , divided them into the same cycle ."
"so they have either survived together , or they would end up with . in that means that if community was successful , they were all <unk> individuals far more <unk> and further off of evolution ."
"the <unk> is where these communities make them so close , they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in and where it is <unk> to the dna ."
and then the next thing that &apos;s been interesting period about a another billion years ago .
"that we have <unk> communities , communities , <unk> from many <unk> , that collectively , like single organism ."
"in fact , we are such as a community of very being authorized ."
so we have lots of cells that aren &apos;t chosen all on themselves .
"your contact skin is <unk> , <unk> , brain cells , and so continued ."
"and so these communities started <unk> , the format that the level was going on , it &apos;s no longer the single cell , but we call the whole factory that we call membranes ."
so the next step came from these communities .
the <unk> started again at <unk> information .
and they <unk> small structures that were making anything during getting there from cells in that .
and these are the residents sequences .
so the ant &apos;s computer cells are built this chemical <unk> .
"they started producing road laboratory in the community , special structures , who had their own technologies to understand the information , and the <unk> it was done to information ."
"and it was the brain , and the nervous system of societies ."
and so that gives you a massive benefit .
"because , at this point , an individual -- learning looked inside the time of history of a event , rather than over those installations ."
"so one organism could learn , after <unk> of food because they didn &apos;t actually eat <unk> da consciously , and she was able to <unk> to have the last time they were burning them ."
"this could do any of the living example in the ages , and back hundreds of years , from the year until these five and hundreds of years , this material needed to be learned because of the individuals left , since this frozen was a traffic ."
so the nervous system does his system biology through that particular <unk> because the evolution could now come inside a sudden screen conflicts now .
she could actually change it within a free face .
now what happens after that was that the individual organisms found a way to communicate in a way .
"so like example , the model for us that -- the <unk> , the human speech is human language ."
"so , it &apos;s a very fundamental invention when you think about it ."
"i have very <unk> here , beginning to <unk> , my <unk> idea for by my head ."
"i &apos;m honored by here , and basically in fact , <unk> <unk> sounds to me , in society so much more <unk> understood that understanding a kind of seemed like my original idea is really about how to bring in the original idea ."
"and so we &apos;re going to take a few complicated complicated significance , not -- <unk> it , and now we can produce a sequence of words quite complicated in the mind for the other ."
so this allows us to do with this is to work even as a space analysis .
"and what we &apos;ve actually done is of all we , human , we know , we &apos;ve started to form speed ."
"we have the same steps that have <unk> now that <unk> <unk> user lives -- that information of how we use . ad <unk> , swim , intuitive ."
"for example , the invention of language was a little , step in that direction ."
"then , computers , computer programs , a terrible and so on -- they threw pretty sophisticated structures on our community that we built in our community to test these information ."
"and it <unk> us all together to come together , something that is much bigger , and then , even faster , in the way , when we &apos;re succeeded ."
"so today , evolution can happen in time ."
you &apos;ve seen very straightforward <unk> <unk> when he &apos;s putting a little bit of evolution in the workforce right side right from your eyes .
"and so again , we got the <unk> <unk> ."
"first , the first steps i &apos;d told you a little 10 years a piece ."
"the next circuits , like the nervous system , the brain , <unk> a hundred million years ."
"then the economics <unk> , like language , as it goes and further , less than another million years ."
"and these next <unk> , like electronics , is the very few decades of coal ."
"the process is letting help itself and it deliver that , so that i think , is the word meaning of what they are with each other ."
"the more things change , the faster it changes ."
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in the dynamic curve .
"we can see this up there , whose time does it live ."
"i live <unk> by computers , and i know i might go to <unk> the floors , and i possibly use by using computers not to use it as recently as taking there , with four thousand segments ."
"now my recent activity is to design objects with such a high complexity , that it is impossible to designing for me in traditional sense ."
i don &apos;t know what each <unk> is doing in a choice .
it has billions of them .
"what i do instead , and whatever the designers of <unk> is , we think about <unk> , we think of some level of the credit , and this machine , one will make something that costs it even better than we could do ."
and it &apos;s partially measures of seeing that the fact that we don &apos;t even understand properly .
"one principle that is particularly interesting , and i &apos;ve used some of the research that &apos;s used lately is -- is evolution ."
"we <unk> <unk> the motor fish , which is that &apos;s <unk> going to happen in the pocket ."
"and to let a example about to what in these settings functions , we can make a program that builds out of <unk> traits ."
"we say , &quot; computers , please consider a hundred million <unk> <unk> random ."
"now all the <unk> should be the <unk> <unk> to come from all the programs , and finally the greatest data that my players have number most recent . &quot;"
"and so in other words , i first wants to <unk> ."
"let &apos;s say , what i want to argue that i may be such a simple example of that i &apos;ve used for it ."
"so both in business to find the location of <unk> , those programs <unk> ."
"of course , in <unk> , that &apos;s a <unk> opportunity is that they &apos;re <unk> by <unk> , <unk> , so actually , probably not the <unk> are made of the dutch man ."
but one of these things with quick two themes of the right back of the right one .
"now i go , &quot; computers , so actually take about the 10 percent of the <unk> that dear that early on is on ."
"those things go out , <unk> all the rest ."
now all <unk> things that are best <unk> being <unk> .
"so , <unk> by making work , unclear to <unk> . &quot;"
"pick two that we built two program together and i need kids and my children <unk> , and the <unk> of calls for two programs to give out ."
so have a new generation of programs that have been shared in societies -- that have come up with collaboration that had <unk> into how other people come together .
"oh <unk> , you guys going , please <unk> this process ."
come back again .
<unk> maybe some mutations .
and try it with another generation again .
and all of these generations may have written very few <unk> .
and so i can raise evolution to a millions of years from <unk> over much minutes to every hour .
i eventually <unk> colors that can program <unk> perfect .
the fact is these programs are so much more <unk> than each of the shelter i could have ever generated by hand .
"and what as i do came to pick these programs , then i can &apos;t say how you work ."
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s <unk> and fascinated programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i did well get to do work because they come from <unk> programs that have made the job move from <unk> .
"because their lives <unk> to if you do the job , you put it right away ."
"i can <unk> into an underground one in <unk> , put it <unk> , and say , &quot; oh , look at this ."
it &apos;s like this <unk> at work of <unk> that work together to do even though they &apos;re safe in . &quot; does that not make you . &quot;
we know that a greenhouse car &apos;s not <unk> if it &apos;s too complicated .
"so we start falling into computers , for a process that was <unk> very much in the <unk> <unk> ."
it allows us to provide a lot higher complexity than it would allow the normal steps to make .
"and yet , we understand the possibility that we don &apos;t do it ."
so <unk> creates technology .
"now we use these programs to make the computer a far faster approach , so we get these particles otherwise capable <unk> ."
so it &apos;s increasing <unk> .
"it gets <unk> <unk> , and i think that is why it appears so much to catch up ."
"because , all these new technologies that we have today out of inner costs ."
we <unk> .
"i got the point when it &apos;s an , the <unk> device has come back at that time as an <unk> structure ."
"so we are the <unk> , and we can &apos;t make some of the external causes that we actually being built down here ."
we &apos;re in the middle of this magnificent rap .
but i do think after our final line comes out .
i find our research obsessed to tell us that we are to genetics in evolution .
and i think we all have place here is the most of what is happening is going here next .
"well , <unk> for lunch now and i think i &apos;m going to hear now more about it before i keep getting older ."
"my story begins right now in <unk> , about two years ago ."
i &apos;ve been in the desert center with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the desert .
we were starting talking about eating nothing going to be over the time of the most dangerous african <unk> .
"if we wanted to go indian that indian , we could travel into a vehicle and turn across the sky ."
"now , we &apos;re doing that with airplanes ."
"it , when the great indian <unk> had <unk> <unk> , he took an <unk> with the <unk> , air ran in there and water mass ."
now we are making these mice and machines .
we found the <unk> that <unk> and magic were supported by machines .
so that really made me sad .
i got something scared of technology .
"and so from that , i felt the ability to lose between full the separation and without <unk> to my friends ."
i found that technology should be possible and not kill free .
"when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me a little mouse himself by standing ."
"that piece of 50 m technology was <unk> , and the most expensive thing to me ."
she became an photons to access to access of <unk> and <unk> them in my eyes .
i found it around me as a while thinking we ran our back and saw cameras from to mind as well .
they were being inspired from one .
and so i found myself in the main world to see how i could use some magic in this way without killing washington .
"and with 16 , i started <unk> books ."
"when i saw the ipad , i saw it as this as the device of a design device that in order to <unk> treatment throughout the world ."
it can know how we survive it .
so it can know where we are .
"it made <unk> images and text . and animation , humor and <unk> ."
it &apos;s the more embedded <unk> .
what are we doing with this ?
and i &apos;m just going to do an interactive mathematical app .
"here &apos;s , &quot; don &apos;t <unk> your fingers at every light . &quot;"
"and so here -- this one says , &quot; this box , &quot; i write my name ."
and i get to the <unk> a shape in the book .
"then after that , a letter looked for me -- and the ipad , for <unk> to where i have been warm -- the outer thing from me -- in fact : this is in closing me ."
"the kid in my kitchen is really <unk> , actually , as quickly ."
i &apos;ve talked much about &quot; magic . &quot;
"i didn &apos;t raise my <unk> and a <unk> , but the <unk> of childhood , those ideas that we do before as kids ."
"so bacteria at a glass , i always found all out , all right ."
"and you have to get the ipad &apos; ipad , and take them out the lights ."
and the pulls the way through the digital book .
"another idea that caught me as a kid , that &apos;s been fascinated by a whole galaxy to be able to receive an <unk> ."
and therefore every book and every world will be a little bit in which i would delete bertie technology .
and that opens a card .
"<unk> had <unk> <unk> , but these cards were <unk> ."
"these map <unk> and works <unk> , and <unk> water force around the united consequences of the book ."
and he found himself from another book .
and i went here .
it &apos;s also important to me to create something that you have that bed <unk> and not very <unk> too .
these are the <unk> .
"we heard all from networks researching and learning nanoparticles , but from how many people around india know their indian colleagues of artistic colleagues who are prisoners ?"
"the poor people were carrying thousands of <unk> in various <unk> , caught one famous book ."
and we push them back to a of a modern history on children .
a story : a issue that passes with new <unk> <unk> .
"and on the present debate , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids sit in their <unk> , they &apos;re on their computers , without to say ."
"but now with <unk> , we can take our children to the natural world with their technology ."
"one same interaction is called a search part , you know , and you need to go out and use the electrode of your extra neurons ."
"as a child , i had <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and framework ."
"somehow , kids don &apos;t get the sight ."
this st observation is <unk> . you need to be out to bring in <unk> a photograph of <unk> a <unk> <unk> back .
in a different chapter you have to have one piece of <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
so you can actually imagine an digital collection of photos <unk> that you can set online .
"one child in london shows the picture of a harvest of a girl and says , &quot; oh , i have seen a therapist . &quot;"
"a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a henry . &quot;"
it makes a kind of social network around a digital museum of pictures that actually made .
so there &apos;s a variety of rules in doing what magic carry around the world and technology with each other .
"a media on the other picture , we &apos;ll <unk> a interaction with the video and used a glass , and through <unk> <unk> , a animation of <unk> might seem like this ."
"in one other place , a mobile is <unk> ."
"you &apos;ve got to take that move from your mouse , you find the rest of the side of your own shoulder ."
and we all move into a world where the insights we can come closer and participate in the technology of the technologies and then technology can expand .
we use the energy of the sun .
"we get our children and closer to the natural world and <unk> . <unk> and childhood , loving love by our childhood is the simple medium ."
thank you .
"so , this is a really privilege for me to be <unk> ."
"i leave the most of my time of people in the public , <unk> or <unk> ."
i spend most of the time with just a typical council in the <unk> and in places that are very <unk> .
"here we &apos;re at ted to be watching , and listen to how inevitable that &apos;s going , has gave me very many strength ."
and the short age here i was quite clear to me : ted has a identity .
"they can tell things from them to impact , they have impact around the world ."
"and sometimes there &apos;s anything about ted , it gets meaning to just a sense and force that could that otherwise ."
"i say that , because i think that identity is really important ."
we &apos;ve seen several fantastic bowl .
"i think we &apos;ve learned that sounds an area of responsibility , but what word that <unk> is particularly forum , especially for stories ."
"the leader can do it . <unk> , doctor , &apos; doctor still , but they &apos;re moving more ."
so that &apos;s why i want to talk about what power is to talk about .
i had not learned in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
"i got the major in a family , a <unk> household <unk> that was faced with a <unk> , and it was my grandmother ."
"she was a dutch , strong wife , she had a movement ."
she had the last word for any food .
it was also the nigerian <unk> of many people in our family .
she was the daughter of an artist .
and her parents were born in the <unk> in virginia .
it was born to <unk> <unk> and particle existence defined a very highly ways .
"my grandmother was so much , but she &apos;s too <unk> ."
"so when i met her as tiny boy , she came up to me and i was making her upset ."
and they announced me so they could barely breathe . then they left me .
"one or two hours later , when i <unk> her , she came up and said , &quot; do you leave my imagination here ? &quot;"
"and if i said &quot; no , &quot; no , <unk> upset me . she <unk> myself , &quot; &quot; had stopped me &apos;s still in financially ."
"and it was at her , she said that you &apos;d always really wanted to be close to her ."
the only trouble was that they had ten children .
and my mother was the most life of their boy .
"sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was <unk> to get your attention ."
my cousins were <unk> around everywhere .
i remember i &apos;ve had to get eight or nine or nine of driving in <unk> and myself into the early people come around like this .
my grandmother had signed up at the end of the desert and becoming <unk> me .
i first thought that it would be a game .
"i saw it <unk> and <unk> , but it saw quite serious ."
"that &apos;s when <unk> 20 minutes or 20 minutes , you turned them into and <unk> me , and she took me to her hand , and said , &quot; watch , you &apos;re going to talk . as you get to talk ."
and i remember that constantly though it was yesterday .
i &apos;m never ever going to forget that .
"it took me out and said to me , <unk> me , running , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you have to promise you sir <unk> ."
"i said , &quot; free grandmother , grandmother . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; <unk> ? i said , &quot; yes . &quot;"
"she sat , gave me back and she looked to me . she says , &quot; i want you to know that i saw you . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re particularly fascinating . &quot;"
"and she said , &quot; i believe you can do anything you want . &quot;"
i will never forget that .
"and then she said , &quot; you have to promise to me just three door , <unk> . &quot;"
"i said , &quot; okay , <unk> . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; well first of the first one that you would love your mom to go end . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; your mom &apos;s nice , and you have to get on the promise you &apos;re always going to take care of you . &quot;"
"i asked my mother , so i said , &quot; well , it &apos;s pretend that i &apos;ll do . &quot;"
"then she said , &quot; the next thing i &apos;m happy that you will always do the right thing , &quot; as soon as that falls is very hard to do that stuff . &quot;"
"i thought , as it thought , &quot; well , <unk> people . i promise . &quot;"
"in the final other , she said , &quot; well , another one you must have to promise is you &apos;re never going to drink <unk> . &quot;"
"well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; i said , rock . &quot;"
"i grew up up in the country , in southern southern north , by the -- and i have a brother who &apos;s a year old and a common child ."
"now , as having about 14 or 15 or 15 , one day my brother would come home and took an <unk> station of my sister with a tough poet , and drove me through the forest ."
we &apos;re just doing it as well as they do .
"then he took a <unk> of beer , and he taught me a little letter and he took me , and then picking them up one ."
"i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . right , you know . power . i &apos;m not supposed to be beer . &quot;"
"my brother traded , &quot; well , we &apos;re doing it today , and now we &apos;re doing everything we do ."
"i had what was someone to do . go there , buy a <unk> . &quot;"
"i said , i &apos;m not . just how it just -- power you do . &quot;"
my brother went <unk> to me .
"he said , &quot; what do we take over this ? now don &apos;t think . &quot;"
"then he watched the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , don &apos;t you &apos;re just thinking crazy about a kind of frustration with daniel ? &quot;"
"i said , &quot; what are you saying &quot; ? &quot;"
"he said , &quot; grandmother will tell all of the <unk> that they are <unk> . &quot;"
and i was destroyed .
i &apos;ll call them some <unk> .
i not to do it that .
there may be <unk> that .
"i am 52 years old , and i tried to <unk> i &apos;m still a drop of suicide either ."
i say that not because i believe it &apos;s feasible . i say it &apos;s tomato . i think it &apos;s identity .
"when we create the best type of identity , we can tell people around us about things that people don &apos;t think that they &apos;re best about ."
and we can do stuff to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
"and of course , my grandmother would say all his <unk> , tell you &apos;d be in particular ."
my grandfather was in prison during <unk> .
my uncle died in the agricultural disease .
and they believed that this is all the issues we needed to do .
and i was trying to tell a bit about what our faith actually was .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
"in t , people were in <unk> and in jail ."
"today , it is <unk> million ."
the united states today has the highest pit of the world .
seven million people in <unk> are on <unk> <unk> or with aging .
i think that <unk> hasn &apos;t changed our world .
"they <unk> in socially weak and black parts of the population of <unk> and market deaths , because of these change ."
"one of three arrested black among young and 30 is in classrooms in prison , on school , at <unk> , was on <unk> , or on <unk> <unk> ."
"communities everywhere in the country , los angeles -- from los angeles to visit <unk> <unk> by washington -- were 50 to 60 percent of your daily men either put in <unk> and reached to <unk> or <unk> with <unk> ."
"but this system is being <unk> by not just to ask questions that will live with <unk> , is also being <unk> by poverty ."
in that country we have the crew that she &apos;s given much better if they are rich and that if they &apos;re rich and <unk> as poor .
"money , not <unk> , . stability is deeply ."
"and yet , we seem to be useless in <unk> ."
and policy from fear and failure even <unk> from their lives to us is that they don &apos;t stand our issues .
we lost the contact .
i find that interesting .
there are some experimental <unk> .
"my <unk> <unk> prize take the <unk> to her right now , if you trade <unk> ."
"and in <unk> today , <unk> percent of the most vulnerable people have left soul to vote behind their left ."
"we actually turn that 10 years the competition is going to be , larger than individuals versus the regime of the <unk> ."
the effort is compelling .
i &apos;ll account kids .
and a lot of my <unk> are very young .
"the u.s. , the countries of america are the only country in the world that shares birth to death in prison ."
"in this country , there &apos;s <unk> medical supply quality of birth 500 people without sleep ."
we &apos;ve invested a lot of time .
the only <unk> country in the world .
i represent people who live in <unk> .
the one of the death of death is an interesting question .
we believe we &apos;ve taught it that the real question is : is a human being <unk> for a mind of he <unk> ?
this is a very glamorous question .
"you also can think about it another , upon how we see our identity ."
"the other picture is not : and anybody got any full of death , but we deserves to kill , are we to kill ?"
i mean <unk> &apos;s data .
the death penalty lifetime is defined by investment .
"on nine people that we &apos;ve chosen are one that we &apos;ve <unk> for innocent acres , <unk> of ones , have dropped off and in the <unk> ."
an amazing fun movie . one of nine <unk> .
i think that &apos;s <unk> .
"we &apos;d never take anyone with a plane to fly , if for nine airplanes , to catch a cockroach ."
we can by creating it in some materials as that problem is designed .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our <unk> .
it &apos;s not the fight .
i &apos;m talking all about these questions .
"i &apos;m talking about <unk> and question for , whether we &apos;re right to kill ."
and it &apos;s relevant because i wish to share more attractive in graduate history . i talk about slavery .
"i talk about terrorism , the time to end of our <unk> , <unk> until the stadium was that the beginning of creativity ."
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but that the <unk> in this country was a time in size .
"in many areas , people were <unk> of <unk> to <unk> ."
or chose instead .
it was the fear of <unk> that shaped to her lives .
"now , these older people come now and say to me , listen , <unk> , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re listening . they &apos;re about to say that they should say it for the first time in history of john story that time , would have a human transformation ."
"they say , &quot; no , well -- tell people we grew up with this . &quot;"
"and to force terrorism , of course , were <unk> the <unk> and crowds of damage and cross ."
and yet there &apos;s obviously a dynamic of development that we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t love with our story .
"and so , we don &apos;t really know what our wondered in the context of development have ."
we <unk> on all the time .
we create <unk> understanding of western and conflicts .
"it takes us to talk about the race , and i think that &apos;s because we are <unk> to talk to us all the kind of truth and a way to run through space ."
"in south africa , there were people that understood that the judgments is not about <unk> with truth and to scale ."
"but even after the workforce of trials in rwanda , nations were not there ?"
i &apos;ve given some talks to germany about the death member .
"it was <unk> , because one of the scientists always said , at my story , and he said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply <unk> to hear you . &quot;"
"he said , &quot; in germany there is no death ."
"and of course , it can never be done in germany anymore . &quot;"
"it <unk> . then one woman said , &quot; the tele-actor with our story is we &apos;re ever that , have been killing us again in the demands of people ."
"it would be known by us , <unk> <unk> people ."
and i thought about it .
"and as we would think , in a world , in which the biosphere gave people the <unk> people , especially when <unk> honored many of aids marx to be ."
it would be <unk> .
it &apos;d be <unk> .
"and yet , in this country , over the u.s. <unk> , brought people there -- here &apos;s the risk of death to death over 11 times higher than <unk> when poor , turned up into the size of juice : when i see black was sugar ."
and yet there &apos;s these <unk> sand compounds .
i think our identity is endangered .
if we don &apos;t always as to deal with those <unk> are the positive and the wonderful things is <unk> as well .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love <unk> .
"but finally , those <unk> <unk> down are <unk> of sorry , <unk> , <unk> ."
i the case of it will determine both those to the two .
"and finally , we &apos;re going to talk about more and more engagement , more engagement , more <unk> , to be able to perform in a complex world ."
"to me , that means to think <unk> and talk to the poor that are no chance that will never be at ted ."
but think in a way that we &apos;re working in our own life .
we must have all hold of things whenever we don &apos;t see .
we do this . we &apos;ve so rational to appreciate how much what we contain .
"innovation , innovation , creativity , not just return ."
"they come from ideas , that are fixed by the fact in our hearts ."
"and it is this <unk> that i think , from , it &apos;s just brought us forward , not to be honest with all the most fragile , but not just about the dark and to the dark ."
"<unk> <unk> , the big <unk> politicians , has said ."
"we were going to be as a kind of <unk> to eastern mortality in europe , all the way we needed : because most of our own , hope , one is a real <unk> , always facing places and when they were <unk> ."
and this virtually <unk> that fat has is about the essence of what i believe as well as the <unk> can be given that ability to get over .
"there &apos;s no effort on technology and design that allowed us to be profitable and at all the time , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and <unk> for poverty , <unk> and right now ."
"i want to invite you around . they need lots and a lot of ways with us , when we don &apos;t really involve it ."
it becomes a lot more <unk> .
"as a higher civil bank , i like to <unk> there , pink <unk> exams ."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> was coming back and back to <unk> , where about two bamboo friends used to <unk> these <unk> , women , who had organized <unk> -- an amazing <unk> -- lady , a white king of death , britain , <unk> death minister ."
so these women would come in and just fell <unk> .
"and off , when he came up , and then she said , &quot; <unk> , <unk> -- and a thousand industries come to the city . let &apos;s blow us off ."
do you want to listen to listen to die and listening ? &quot;
"and i said , &quot; yeah , very much . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; well , what &apos;s you evelyn if you &apos;re there ? &quot;"
"i said , &quot; i &apos;ll listen . &quot;"
and then i had accumulated over and went just to be fascinated .
it was always so motivated to address this .
"and i sat there day and i would <unk> these women and be once <unk> to buy women to have , and they said to me &quot; now i would say , &quot; you &apos;ll tell me what company is &quot; 2020 . &quot;"
what are they trying to do ? &quot;
i started with my <unk> speaking .
"i said , &quot; let &apos;s attempt to <unk> against <unk> ."
people want to help people who have <unk> you .
we want <unk> and discrimination in <unk> security .
we want to stop <unk> aid without weight for kids .
we want to fight something against the core <unk> .
we want to fix the number that we want to split .
we want to <unk> and not replace movement .
"i gave my husband <unk> , and then looking at me and <unk> , and they said , &quot; <unk> . &quot; so . &quot;"
"she said , &quot; well , you will be very , very , very smoke . &quot;"
"then <unk> <unk> <unk> to me , <unk> on my face and said , &quot; and so you have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;"
and so i believe that the <unk> should be <unk> .
"and we need to start <unk> the ways to picture these issues : these problems , suffering that ."
because the one is that our humanity is in because of our own humanity .
"in my work , i learned a very simple amount of things ."
i &apos;ve learned a few really simple things .
and as we are all more than that in the worst <unk> of what we &apos;ve ever done .
i think it &apos;s true for every person that is on the planet .
"so if somebody thinks it &apos;s in <unk> , it &apos;s not just a congo ."
"if you take someone that won &apos;t be heard , they don &apos;t only just do conflict ."
"who kills someone , not just a <unk> thing ."
"and in that field , there &apos;s a very fundamental human one that must respect that military ."
"i also believe that in many parts of that country , and with security in many of the rest of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not creation ."
i don &apos;t think it .
i think in many ways the opposite of poverty is poverty .
"and finally , i believe that even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so powerful and <unk> , and so , we can &apos;t start the end of our technology at the end , not used to make things that we won &apos;t learn and our perception ."
"and finally , a society won &apos;t exist to how they slow their rich and the positive to treat but to run their companies with poor , the poor , the <unk> , the land wreck ."
because we &apos;re beginning in the context of that actual way of understanding what makes us up .
sometimes i have a <unk> . somebody &apos;s story along the end .
i just <unk> too much .
i get tired of up the moment as we all .
"sometimes these ideas forward , the way we think , go ahead , in a major way ."
i represent those kids who were <unk> very <unk> .
"i &apos;m going to the <unk> , and i have a <unk> , who is in order to be 13 and 14 years old , and if the grow to a trip in paris shall ."
so i got a question : how did i see this happen ?
"how can a judge devil somebody and turn somebody , which he is not ?"
"the judge <unk> his being <unk> , but i see a child ."
"at the front of it , i turned to around and thinking , i felt like a police , if an judge can turn us into something else , it has to have <unk> ."
"super , bad , the judge did sticks ."
you should have the grandparents .
"and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t do more and think i started working on a <unk> pack ."
"i had a <unk> <unk> , poor boy like me called <unk> ."
"and i started by this <unk> all the film -- <unk> phone : &quot; well , my poor , elderly <unk> like a 3 , white , white commitment to treat <unk> ."
"and then in my <unk> , i explained that <unk> scans and <unk> were around by need to take care of if you &apos;ve <unk> ."
"it gave an call of a crazy line of <unk> that , that nothing gets seen more solved in the country that there &apos;s just more plastic ."
"the next morning i realized , and i didn &apos;t know if i just wrote this crazy <unk> or see that i was in 1960 ."
"and on the hunger of my estate , i found not just written it , i <unk> it for the court ."
"i had this lunch for a few months , and i &apos;d only <unk> all over it ."
"but finally i decided to them , my god , i have to go to the dish and kick my nuts ."
i got up into a car . i was really overwhelmed . overwhelmed .
so i went to the skeleton .
"and i thought that was so hard , so painful ."
"and finally , i went out in in my car and started the staircase high force ."
"as i went into the <unk> point to the cancer , there was a older <unk> man of the high market ."
"so when he saw me he approached me and he called to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;"
"i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;"
he got to me and captures me .
so he launched me in the <unk> .
"he said , &quot; well , i &apos;m so proud of her . &quot;"
"and i got to say , there was more strength to me ."
"it <unk> a very deep safely in response , a single capacity to take things back to a community , to a sequence of hope ."
"so , i &apos;ve done some <unk> ."
and as you saw the judge me .
"he said , &quot; <unk> , did you put the crazy <unk> ? &quot;"
"i said , &quot; well , do i did . &quot; and then we started talking to that ."
"increasingly , people were coming in , because they were empty ."
that i &apos;ve written these <unk> stuff .
it was <unk> in and <unk> and <unk> in it .
"in <unk> , the full side was really so people who were angry with over tokyo , to talk about poverty , stigma <unk> ."

he went on and off .
"finally , the dutch man arrived in the morning , <unk> with a very endless <unk> <unk> , would travel there on me , almost on the <unk> ."
"10 minutes later , the judge <unk> gives an <unk> ."
in the <unk> minority <unk> girls came into choice in the science county it was one designer hall .

"and the older husband being grounded . he saw the <unk> <unk> , he looked at me and he said , &quot; i am <unk> to say , when i &apos;m three <unk> , you don &apos;t have to be careful from the ideas . &quot;"
"i &apos;ve come to ted because i think a lot of you have come wrong that the moral <unk> of the universe is far <unk> , but that it &apos;s a guess of justice ."
"that we are totally honeybees as people , as long as have not been really generated by human rights and states ."
and our every single one of the survival of our survival is connected .
"that we &apos;ve got our visions of technology and design , and design and creativity has to connect with humanity , except for justice and justice ."
"and most of you that i just want to have those of you who who look at all the right now , just say , you lose from the face . don &apos;t give you ."
"you &apos;ve seen this audience , this community , the primary desire to have heard and be heard , helps you and to do something ."
"so , what can we do to we do ?"
"<unk> <unk> : well , there are across possibilities ."
"when they live in california , that there &apos;s a heat ring <unk> in this artificial spring to actually something from government , that else is a few doctors who are <unk> in politics ."
"here , in california , you &apos;ll take a billion dollars in the next <unk> of a billion dollars for the death sector factor of a billion ."
"and yet , <unk> percent of all <unk> do not suffer from a ride ."
<unk> percent of everybody would show you any <unk> .
here &apos;s how much chance we can do something .
that <unk> is led to delete it in more fail and providing safe .
"so , i think , there &apos;s been opportunities everywhere ."
"the last three decades , the <unk> school has lost food ."
this space is often taken to a <unk> .
what would you like to tell somebody who believes that ?
"well , in fact , the number of tortured is actually changed ."
the most important noise that <unk> in this country did not really speak about <unk> .
and it was <unk> therefore hyena .
and therefore the <unk> start to make high smaller signs in the <unk> .
we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> .
"now we have somewhat nice , repair people who get <unk> from an <unk> of food supply , for which <unk> <unk> , for the <unk> <unk> good good , instead of <unk> them <unk> -- the papers ."
"i believe that we need to do more people , help people to survive violent health , not for less ."

they are the inspiring personality .
thank you so much . thank you . thank you .
"<unk> with himself , ? <unk> is going to get a <unk> , you know ."

four of them : <unk> <unk> . la dangerous : fair <unk> .
"six <unk> <unk> . <unk> , 7 : 65 headlines ."
<unk> 8 : 9 / 8 : chimpanzee telling meat releases .
various <unk> justice foundation . <unk> .

oh my god .
"so those are only one of the worldwide islands that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months had had , but one &apos;s probably to be it for the last six days ."
"the fact is that the media have there taking us negative facts , because our minds look at it carefully over that sensitivity was here ."
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
every second of the same time our sense we have much more information than you <unk> experience .
"and because nothing more important we is as was our survival , the first station in our case just come on <unk> for all of the information that comes out ."
"so this is a deeper in our <unk> , our favorite <unk> ."
it <unk> and <unk> the entire information on <unk> <unk> of major <unk> in our environments .
"so , if we see the news , we expect to feel bad about the panbanisha ."
"and the old <unk> lifestyle when it stops , the funding &quot; politics are very negatively ."
"now , with all of our digital tools that we <unk> to seven days for about every day 24 hours : every <unk> of all these negative news is no wonder that we &apos;re the <unk> ."
it &apos;s no wonder that everyone thinks that it &apos;s going to look less sad worldwide .
"but possibly , that &apos;s not the case ."
that might be the reality .
"and maybe the enormous progress we &apos;ve made over here , over a variety of forces , so much of kanzi do so that it will be <unk> to the next three decades , to create a world ."
"well , i don &apos;t get to say that we have big problems -- disorders , left cold , water system and solar energy systems -- the neanderthals ."
"and as humans , we do better in how we fix problems too long , but they <unk> finally around them ."
"so what we &apos;ve actually been thinking , you know , what we &apos;ve got over the past century now , is we can start the evolution ."
"the last 100 years has further on this average life expectancy where the palestine is actually planted , which has passed its earth ."
child mortality is lower by an minus .
what is this assumes is that actually got <unk> and <unk> wires for <unk> or getting <unk> .
steve <unk> showed us that we &apos;ve now live in a very ancient period of the maximum time .
"and charles <unk> <unk> is up the percent bill in the last year , for 25 percent , which is than eight meters after on 80 percent ."
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and a lot of people stopped .
and we keep increasing our expectations constantly .
"actually , we have redefine poverty ."
"and keep thinking that a major , population , the age of american people , growing on electricity , <unk> , water , education , <unk> , chemistry , <unk> and <unk> cars , sex ."
"the richest past recent , the <unk> of our earth must have been able to stand back on this past ."
"leading into and technologies are designing technologies for various times , and developing ."
"my good friend ray <unk> told us that each little candidate that will be <unk> to drop off to the <unk> law of moore &apos;s curve , and into cost every 12 to 24 months ."
this is the main for your saying that goes to <unk> about a million times less and it is weight faster than <unk> <unk> from the 1970s .
look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law hall last hundred years .
do share two things in the top of this curve .
"first , how <unk> is in <unk> more like modern period , and peace , recession , technology , depression and depression ."
that &apos;s the result of exciting computers with the usual computers building .
they in none of our big problems that we know .
"also , despite their <unk> <unk> on the left-hand side , they is up ."
so <unk> itself into a <unk> .
"and at this curve on what appears on the back of moore , we find a photograph of extraordinary technologies that are all available ."
"&quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; what my friends with <unk> &quot; call <unk> , sensors , sensors , robots , <unk> virtual insight that allow nearly to roll out up at our planet last planet , <unk> biology , meat , <unk> and electronic communication block , <unk> and digital intelligence ."
how many of you have seen it by blowing <unk> 2004 ?
and that &apos;s where <unk> came .
i &apos;ve used the rules to keep reading and show the best headlines that i was able to find .
i love this one : &quot; watson of man &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; risk is no simple game .
the <unk> is dealing with language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence of infection using a <unk> for each driver .
"four years ago , ray <unk> <unk> , and i here at ted , a new university named <unk> university ."
"we <unk> our students to all these technologies at <unk> <unk> how they can be used to be , to solve the great challenges of humanity ."
"and every year we ask the students , businesses , store people and services that have made the care of <unk> life from people who are <unk> ."
think about what a group of science is that a group of students today make life improvement from people .
"30 years ago , this would be a kind of ridiculous substitute ."
now we can approach organizations that are done again today .
"if i think <unk> to make the life wave , i don &apos;t mean , i &apos;m monitoring a comfort for huge every country on this planet , it &apos;s coming to make an alive of time ."
it &apos;s about creating buildings outside security in <unk> .
"because reality is the <unk> music system , and technology is like a resource to infect force ."
here &apos;s an example .
this is the tale of <unk> in the middle of the islamic century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of <unk> to the dinner .
"military <unk> were <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
the king of northern <unk> were getting scared .
but bill and disease . right in terms of that time on the planet was <unk> when overnight and acceptance .
"now , this is why the <unk> of <unk> made out of our style ."
even <unk> percent of the gap changed comes out as the <unk> of destruction .
it becomes connected to oxygen and <unk> .
"but the technologies of the energy market was created , and went along so computing so cheap that we use it to our capital process ."
so let &apos;s set out to lunch these analysis for a half .
we think about <unk> now .
"ladies and gentlemen , regrets world with more energy energy than we are used to consume more and more <unk> than we use every year ."
16 energy energy only came along from the left every seven minutes of the earth .
"it &apos;s not about <unk> , that &apos;s a problem except <unk> ."
and there &apos;s good news .
"so in this year , you did first , which is in 50 percent in <unk> to reduce the cost of indians as 15 percent of the <unk> -- <unk> punishment in europe compared to ronald <unk> ."
cost <unk> to 50 percent of income in the last year in half .
"last month , the past 25 is <unk> to map that stands out until by the end of this particular decade in <unk> six cents a $ <unk> per dollar consumption , in the national budget ."
"and if we have an assessment structure , we &apos;re going to have water in the test ."
let &apos;s talk about calculus .
"do you remember , as joseph <unk> <unk> , when it turns out , the globe <unk> , was then <unk> , back to earth ?"
he put a <unk> photograph at it . how did it ?
&quot; <unk> a <unk> <unk> . &quot;
because we live on an <unk> .
we live on an excellent billion growing water on reserve with water .
"yes , there &apos;s <unk> percent oil , two percent of terror , and we fighting about second the <unk> infections on the planet , but there &apos;s still hope ."
"and there are new technologies , not of really having 30 or 20 years now , but now ."
they &apos;re new <unk> . they &apos;re excited .
"and our recent 40 years before -- to put together with the <unk> from the border to <unk> , i want to share some with you -- he gave me the flow of a string plan , and his client would have heard of you about a big sudden ."
"it can produce a thousand dollars of clean water in every day -- only seawater , water , water <unk> -- <unk> water -- and all it is raise less than one per <unk> per star ."
"the director of coca-cola has just its own <unk> , an endless cost that has really needs to go with a hundred breakthroughs in the developing world ."
"and when everything goes whole , and i &apos;m very successful , this technology will apply globally to all the planet and the real world on this planet ."
this is lack of innovation that &apos;s today .
and we saw it also in a town of <unk> .
"you turn my green media system , we parents soon do <unk> from babies in both of the developing world to <unk> ."
but just think a solar device has an approach to a cell in the center of kenya has a better church than president 25 years ago .
"and if you &apos;re going to look up at your smartphone , you have learned more access to know , and when president <unk> against 15 years ago ."
"they live in a world of information and communication communications in the world , which nobody would have been able to have been able to have been an <unk> ."
"and he &apos;s still working much , the things that them spend , and i &apos;ve spent hundreds of thousands of dollars -- witness and image -- now , science and music , are now <unk> and technology for the age of dead -- literally permanent ."
and the best of that is probably what are considered ourselves in the area .
"now , the only month , i had the pleasure photographer who gave <unk> this &quot; $ 10 million <unk> <unk> x <unk> . &quot;"
"we have to compete also on all over the world , just connect these technologies in an x-ray such to be done with the device that you can talk about them , we can be <unk> with a processing or your most <unk> disorder ."
"and to win , that &apos;s have to provide much r / doctors than a team <unk> ."
"imagine that device ; by the middle of a developing world , where it &apos;s not low , but women &apos;s own one 25 percent of the palm <unk> and 1.3 percent of the staff ."
"by a device but any genome genome model that &apos;s what &apos;s known , they don &apos;t -- because it takes the way for you , and scratch a total collapse taken in front of you would expand their <unk> ."
but now to the largest force that needs us to be in a world of health care .
i call them &quot; the least billion &quot; . &quot;
the white lines are out for population .
we just <unk> the window up there .
"and by the way , the biggest largest food supply is a co <unk> and the food diet in the entire world ."
we had <unk> right now in 2010 this is from two billion people .
"so by 2020 , we reduce <unk> from the five billion organs ."
three billion ideas that we haven &apos;t heard of before are the global communication with works .
what do those people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what are you going to help ?
and as many of information <unk> i see one of the most important economic magnitude in history .
these people represent multiple dollars on the world that are growing up in the global economy .
"and they will get healthier throughout the use of <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be trained in the <unk> , and , by understanding that you have a <unk> , 3d 3d <unk> and <unk> cycle , and as much as much as they do ."
"so what can do 3 billion <unk> , healthy , healthy , productive ecology of all convince domestic communities ?"
and the thing about 100 new people would never have been on touch .
"what about it , the <unk> around whatever the business is that they &apos;ve got to give the voice to be point all around and to draw in place , for <unk> ?"
what will occur those three billion people save ?
"well , what if we were <unk> <unk> that can &apos;t even assume ?"
"one of the things that i learned from x <unk> is that small teams that are stripped and slow down and focus writing , contribute to extraordinary things , things that <unk> great companies and children only in the past ."
i want to end with a story that really <unk> me .
there &apos;s a program which perhaps may have known a person .
it &apos;s a game called the main purpose .
it actually was developed at the university of london in seattle .
"and it &apos;s a game in which individuals can take a sequence of amino acids and explore , just how the protein is going to develop ."
the cat for that shape can changes this <unk> and function .
and that &apos;s very important in <unk> .
far as that is a problem for <unk> .
and this play was <unk> by hands and etc .
and that is now hundreds of thousands of people who played the play .
"and it turns out that today , the human staff would turn better back that proteins called the best tie ."
"and when these people came and looked at who was the best classes in the world , this is not a matter of course , not a <unk> , an octopus , a woman , who was a woman to have a woman pack of minister and the top team a piece of the joy within the u.n. and"
"ladies and <unk> , which is why <unk> trust me in our future will recognize is the fact that what we have more meaning today , of magnitude , it turns to organizing us our big challenges ."
we have access to tools with technology to interactive .
we have a passion to the heart seat .
we have the capital of record .
"and we have three billion new lives , that we can work working online globally to stop the challenge and to <unk> that to do what we need ."
we expect several kinds of often .
thank you .
i believe that we need to grow up to a <unk> kind of culture .
and i think it &apos;s started with an electron address and it draw .
"and maybe i &apos;m up for a long time to deal with , and , as i can allow it to give give off some fake possibilities for me to give up this ."
"however , before i begin to consider the actual subject of my book , let &apos;s start with a little paint ."
"hey , why not ?"
"we &apos;re in the <unk> near , moving up to the physician ."
"we all love it in baseball , right ?"
baseball game is full of big statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
"&quot; 1947 forever , and occurred to statistics and <unk> about use a really <unk> coke team ."
i &apos;m <unk> about an stunning statistics that i hope most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the road .
we talk about 300 districts when a commercial button .
that means that the player <unk> unlikely drop for three percentage of <unk> .
"this is called the ball to <unk> , it gets up , it won &apos;t get stuck , and you wolfram the ball has tried to grab on <unk> wide paintings , and you were able to <unk> in security ."
three from <unk> .
you know how to call your <unk> into major hawking ?
"well , you know , ok . so maybe a <unk> , a sound ."
you know how to call a <unk> .
"so , this is something that is happening inside <unk> like there is <unk> ."
<unk> -- like ted <unk> <unk> -- the last collection of non-zero-sum during its play <unk> banks during several times over it .
"let &apos;s <unk> back to my world where medicine crops that i feel some kind of <unk> , i do a little bit less , or perhaps the <unk> less about i mentioned these to you ."
"suppose they have a <unk> and you &apos;ll be a <unk> <unk> <unk> , whose week is scarce protection for <unk> ."
"and kind of it does not work , false ."
"imagine around a certain kind of target in ice and they <unk> their loved people with flag , and their special clients are on <unk> for some <unk> in half of each other than 18 in traffic blood density ."
"and but , do you know what ?"
she &apos;s a lot better . she &apos;s on the board of <unk> .
and she <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work like this .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
"what do you believe in sort of <unk> knee or a nurse or a nurse , a <unk> , would an <unk> be a <unk> ?"
"1,000 , very good ."
"the truth is that , we should know dan knows what a good head or a doctor should be ."
but what we &apos;re doing though is that we may including me driven my leg with <unk> .
"you never make any mistakes , no one will , but you see the details of the sensitivity to what to do it will be ."
and that &apos;s the news that i took in the winter winter .
i was a powerful goodbye school .
"in high school , a second grade child mentioned brian <unk> , he would learning to save for a god ."
so it was it .
and i learned in my little 20s having imagined <unk> on the north party of highly common <unk> of <unk> from here .
i learned it all .
"in my favorite , i learned the <unk> and <unk> of each <unk> , every basement , every load of sticks that ends filled with the margins from that chamber , <unk> <unk> ."
i had even <unk> the nickname of <unk> court as a choice of <unk> .
"and this , the inertia : i took more and more to go ."
"and i was okay , i went with <unk> ."
"and i left <unk> the <unk> to the impression that i knew anything , and it was it anything like , like you know as close to <unk> as i do <unk> <unk> that i should make that mistake be made with mistakes ."
"and i <unk> it for a time to meet hand until , for a time ."
i created a <unk> <unk> on this legally in <unk> as a woman picking from a hole in his education teacher .
"at this time , i was facing the <unk> layer in <unk> service ."
and it was my <unk> that was looking for the <unk> jeff <unk> study for the <unk> .
and public problems of being in more <unk> .
i visited robert <unk> and she was in <unk> <unk> .
"and when i &apos;d get really asked that , she made sounds weird ."
"and when i had their breast , on to my breast power , i could hear a tiny <unk> sound on both sides that shook out of me with <unk> ."
"this is a state <unk> , not breaking the entire blood of tissues , making makes a chunk of the air force work around the gulf &apos; center and so that i actually picked up , and it came up to the imperial matrix ."
and that was not hard to shrink therapy .
i made them and made me care for that .
"i gave her <unk> , and i was having her medicine to take control of the hearts ."
"i gave her medicine that we <unk> , water pills , so they could put the liquid ."
"and over a load and a half hours , i started to feel better ."
i felt right true .
and i went through that initial mistakes : i shipped her home .
"actually , i made two errors ."
i sent them home without talking north america .
"and i didn &apos;t <unk> them , and i actually <unk> what i &apos;d do &quot; this flight &quot; was like -- to come to my name <unk> , so that , would give him a fashion wish to make an own life . &quot;"
and he knew it was able to get extra information onto their own teeth .
maybe it had very good time in those boys .
and maybe i won &apos;t want to be the physician .
"maybe i wanted to leave as successful and so impossible to take your responsibility around , so i was in that condition of my patient , so i would have to <unk> my doctor without <unk> with him ."
my second mistakes was worse .
"and by running this , i would push you home , i &apos;m wearing a very <unk> voice into me trying to tell myself , &quot; no good idea . no good idea do . &quot;"
"in fact , i used so so much the time -- i asked the nurse , which to hold <unk> for women , &quot; believe this &quot; right through , if it goes home ? &quot;"
"and the nurse thought about that and was in a more reasonable way , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;ll be doing good . &quot;"
"and i remember , as i was yesterday ."
"so i took the <unk> and an <unk> and the <unk> came home , and that goes home ."
and i put back back to work .
"the rest of the day , i had that <unk> feeling in my pocket ."
but i was working on .
"and the end of that day , i spent where i went through the hospital , i &apos;m going to train in vehicle and then i went to the car room for a way i did something which i hadn &apos;t seen ."
i went through my way of time right .
"and there was a different nurse , not the nurse &apos;s eyes to <unk> with <unk> , but one twitter to me and there &apos;s three words of them , and most beloved , most of the details i know ."
"other <unk> , they &apos;re kind of like to be , but the baby in mars &apos;s very unlikely to look because we just see the patient &apos;s friends ."
the three words are more -- did you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient thinking to your home ? &quot;
answer in the nurse asked .
"so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in that particular boat ."
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
"it took about one hour after them to go home after i was through , <unk> home , turned the family to offer her <unk> , and the author hit them back on the <unk> photos is about a <unk> <unk> ."
"they were hardly sane , and they did <unk> ."
"it built all the strands , all strands ."
they gave her a sign .
they <unk> the <unk> car .
i <unk> in countless family for me to the inner prison .
and i used to that <unk> because they came off the uv on the hospital or i &apos;d come around them .
"and after two , three days then that she would never <unk> again ."
it didn &apos;t have one <unk> failure .
"their family , <unk> ."
"and during the course of the next eight days , they actually happens to the date ."
"it <unk> you , <unk> <unk> -- <unk> woman , a woman , <unk> the grandmother ."
"you think that there is never something that had to be , perhaps ."
and this was the first time i learned this from that .
"i was saving my vision , and i made what mr. <unk> &apos;s worth of communications planet that exists in our medical culture alone -- i was <unk> , so rather what possible task might not speak to them ."
"you know everyone knows the healthy , when you give an mystery from your best friend , despite it becomes a <unk> , and you will notice , i &apos;m going to attack one of the best talk and a joke when you give it to a killer frequency rate ."
if you help workers move away and <unk> all the mistakes .
that &apos;s the kind of <unk> shame .
"the <unk> kind of a little bit over the world is that , <unk> one by the birth of a <unk> ."
"it &apos;s the one who tells you is not what you &apos;re doing in your hand , but it &apos;s the very bad thing ."
and that was what i felt .
"and it wasn &apos;t on the bottom of my theme , it was extremely malleable ."
"he spoke to the family , and i am sure that he convinced the workforce and just thought that i would be wrong ."
but i hired these questions .
why have i <unk> ? i didn &apos;t you ask yourselves ? why are i <unk> them ?
"and then in my worst <unk> , how could i make a substantial mistake ?"
why did i stand in medicine ?
but slowly it &apos;s safe to <unk> .
i began to feel better .
"and then on a crucial day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke , and i could feel like i can get the remaining again again ."
"and i <unk> to make sure that i could comment my effort for an <unk> to make , and never some <unk> that the voice could take that <unk> ."
and they did .
and i kept working .
and it was happening again .
"two years later , i had fund a service in western <unk> per drug in <unk> north civil women , and i <unk> two famous testosterone to the <unk> <unk> ."
it was a lot of place and i did .
he giving yourself <unk> here .
i looked in the center ; i took it a little pink .
and i gave him an engine in one <unk> and sent him away .
"and again , when he walked out of the door , he showed his leg ."
"two days later , i got to my next <unk> institute , and my <unk> <unk> asked me to participate in her office ."
and she said that three words : do you remember ?
&quot; you remember your patients with the <unk> ? &quot;
and what it turns out is that he <unk> the phone .
it had an <unk> drug illness named <unk> .
"you can explain the kitchen , but it &apos;s not a wider gas , it &apos;s caused by car <unk> and producing the <unk> of man &apos;s co2 <unk> ."
"and <unk> , who died ."
he got <unk> into <unk> and quickly done a couple of days later .
"and i went through the same characteristics of <unk> and <unk> , feeling <unk> <unk> and went and <unk> to work over , and over again ."
"in a crowd , i &apos;ve missed a golf bike ."
"there &apos;s a whole lot of things that you do about that , especially when you see that in a hospital , who was working at this period , just only 14 patients per night ."
"in both these cases i did not take her home , and i guess that &apos;s not really a ashamed of freedom ."
"at a point i thought it had , <unk> ."
"and i took the filters of my achilles &apos; microscope in hallucinations , when this was a bacteria , asked me there was my colleague with <unk> , who had a <unk> on the patients with the roof <unk> on the right and called the <unk> ceremony ."
the other form was a high <unk> .
i was trying to go back to <unk> and asked to use my colleagues to <unk> .
"and that kind of juice , and when he had a <unk> in the right <unk> , <unk> on the lower village ."
"in both cases , <unk> became in time and they made a bit ."
"both of these <unk> are failing me , and she and <unk> ."
"and i &apos;d be happy to tell you that my worst mistakes only of the early five years of living life <unk> to a lot of my colleagues is , but <unk> &apos;s crazy ."
some of my favorite <unk> in the past 12 years .
"in alone , abandoned and without any help ."
"and it &apos;s the problem that is , if i don &apos;t close and speak by any of my mistakes and tell you , if i can first talk about it -- what is really done to me about my colleagues ?"
how can i teach you my mistakes so they don &apos;t solve the users ?
"if i was in a room -- like stopping that now , i don &apos;t know what you think about ."
when did you see the last times of somebody talking about <unk> across <unk> ?
"oh , you go to an serious party , and there &apos;s some some different trained hearing about any flower , and you don &apos;t talk about somebody &apos;s own thinking ."
"if i had this high force with inspiring colleagues and just request your immediate dreams and how to tell you what i &apos;d just told you most -- i &apos;d probably won &apos;t do that the opposite story , you would make a little thing , before people <unk> you really test you better before ."
"and indeed , if i knew my colleagues would know that a pandemic would have <unk> <unk> tomorrow in my hospital , then i believe , i would have problems by him , and look at wood ."
so it is the system that we live in .
it &apos;s <unk> or even a predator .
it &apos;s a system that in which we have two basic matrix -- those that have impossible <unk> and those that do they don &apos;t do . they who might do them <unk> and also the fun two or different things with good <unk> with the good public pressures .
it &apos;s nearly a representative reaction to the sound that <unk> people .
"and there is the idea that , when we take the people who <unk> pieces of medicine , they allow us to place an election system ."
but there &apos;s two problems with it .
"in my career &apos;s own public medical school , and journalism , i created a personal study about medical mistakes and wrong <unk> together for putting me at all my first article that i described for from the <unk> <unk> level ."
and what i learned is that completely <unk> were <unk> .
"we &apos;re working in a system that will happen every day in which one another had either false employees , either <unk> is wrong or false <unk> on the <unk> and the <unk> , <unk> or <unk> anymore ."
"now in this state , about <unk> <unk> chimps are dying with errors ."
"in the united states , the crowd has the <unk> for medicine in <unk> ."
these are the big frames to be very strong because we can &apos;t look at the problem that we should .
and is the <unk> .
"one small capital in the food , i know , our medical knowledge actually will be holding two to three to three years , we can &apos;t keep up ."
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we cannot clean it .
we own a cognitive mistake that we can take a perfect blood unit supply on the ground with the dolphins .
"then i do the same patient with it , i take back <unk> and <unk> it and record a <unk> , takes a little <unk> , and suddenly <unk> the story with <unk> ."
i don &apos;t take the same seals .
i &apos;m not a robot . i &apos;m not doing stuff forever .
and my patients are no cars ; they tell me they don &apos;t always tell me the same kind of work in the same sort of .
all of those <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
"so if you take the system as this gives me a drug <unk> <unk> and the all <unk> king <unk> , nobody else with it ."
and you know the characteristics in <unk> in your own fault that aren &apos;t going to talk about if you wanted to talk about people &apos; worst cases ?
"in my <unk> <unk> , black or square , i have the <unk> to say , &quot; that &apos;s my fail to whatever i &apos;d be from a <unk> girl &apos;s whale <unk> , &quot; that &apos;s my <unk> experience , and so lady , &quot; <unk> <unk> ."
"and then the <unk> their <unk> , and you run along the <unk> <unk> , take look down and get small , and you grow your stories as we get ."
they want to tell stories . they want to share their stories .
"they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same text that i meet . &quot;"
what it does is have a environment which you pay you into your face .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
"he is <unk> , a hunger he &apos;s aware , detect his humanity , . she turns out she &apos;s not safe to make experiences , but it puts anything out of you , so it &apos;ll go apart ."
she inspired their experience with other .
it &apos;s exciting as other people of their errors .
"and it showed other people , they don &apos;t know that <unk> <unk> these , but in a <unk> sort of a scale , <unk> kind of that all benefit ."
"and she works in a medical culture that <unk> <unk> people the system with life and when it is so , people &apos;re also making mistakes by time ."
"so , to make that , then <unk> evolution <unk> making more risks , helping people completely make liberty and support with good interest , to create angry spaces where everybody can , where everyone , even in mind , and indeed , does what other opinion <unk> things , can produce things , and try to improve quality"
my name is brian <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> <unk> her goal .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;ll make mistake .
"i &apos;m muslim but i am doing some trials , one more thing i do to learn to make it be an alternative ."
"i don &apos;t get what they <unk> me , but that &apos;s what i can live with ."
"so let me close by three words that i did , i remember ."
"so i &apos;m going to talk about a little , small idea ."
and it &apos;s just <unk> trials .
"and because you can explain that kind of idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories before , for once ."
"the first story of charles darwin , my heroes ."
you probably know him staring up there .
"you can think that we would <unk> them , but that &apos;s not true ."
"in fact , he <unk> fish ."
he described one of them as very market .
it was a reserve <unk> .
"until in the &apos; 80s , he became big style of emotion ."
now it &apos;s a group of experiencing the <unk> .
"this story we have heard many times from galapagos or from other places , and it &apos;s very particularly frequently ."
"yet , we still all end up going to that galapagos ."
"we &apos;ll do it still , have been originally ."
the <unk> ever <unk> them in charge and itself .
what is what happened there ?
the second story is of getting a different concept to <unk> <unk> that show you .
"because i did have this as a <unk> , and i was looking at a <unk> museum ."
i went there because i grew up in europe and i was hoping to work in africa later .
"i thought , then i could have become more sustainable ."
"and i got a <unk> <unk> , and i really believed that i really didn &apos;t even get there ."
"so , i was my first <unk> project ."
"now they look , the education effects of <unk> and amongst them was a couple of of <unk> ."
"it was <unk> &apos;s <unk> of 20 feet , <unk> , an ideological <unk> of plastic waste parking ."
so the <unk> of these gave were very <unk> and the fishermen lived doing well and <unk> around ghana &apos;s around his citizens for sanitation .
"when i got to get 27 years later , the fish went on to half of the size ."
this <unk> daughters <unk> in five feet .
they &apos;ve been part of <unk> .
"this were even fish , everywhere ."
people are still happy .
"and the fish also had , as you were lucky , that &apos;s true to be there ."
so it &apos;s <unk> nothing . and nothing different changed .
"my third , story of my story , tell the grand girl , the <unk> <unk> story ."
<unk> &apos; back in &apos; 70s -- rather than <unk> -- early pakistan spending <unk> a lot .
"<unk> was <unk> organisms , even 100 million people were beginning , the industrial metal scan of this kind of pretty creature called <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> medicine ."
"i was carrying , and we did <unk> in south <unk> ocean , and especially in the central museum ."
we had no words on what we &apos;ve embraced that .
i know now that this was the reason i had you will do .
"90 percent of our <unk> have encountered radius , other animals that are connected to this ."
"the female keys makes the fish , the little dots there on the top , and the cover were ashamed ."
"basically , that was the reason of <unk> down , and the plate was spread really were assembled ."
those pictures are extraordinary because the transition is very quickly .
in a year you will lead the <unk> that happens and then <unk> the car <unk> .
the reason is changing . in this case -- for very obvious reason or fishing fat is going to get <unk> of <unk> .
that is a dead shift .
"they were orphaned , they were sent as they were , because they were dead ."
once we started a staff number one .
she didn &apos;t buy others .
"they would ask them , because they could eat it good ."
"in fact , this mountain of <unk> would break <unk> any of these <unk> if they run into areas never <unk> ."
it won &apos;t artificial .
"we change the world , but we don &apos;t remind ourselves ."
"we fit our new level of level , and we do not <unk> into it , which was there ."
"so then you say , and if you put this ."
"on the <unk> <unk> are a couple of good things : <unk> , number number of <unk> that are on green , the basic , the <unk> ."
"during time it changes . it &apos;s <unk> because for people , their own before ."
"every generation the pictures that , <unk> them at the beginning of their <unk> lives , as a united states and it goes out everything from it ."
the difference is going to be photographed as loss .
but they &apos;re not going to take the dirty losses .
there is a <unk> order in language .
and just at the end of you want to end up with the past that are <unk> .
"and that &apos;s now by <unk> the very , our goal ."
"we want to keep things that are disappear and things that were not more like , as they were ."
"you here would think the problem that people were bringing out for people when they lived in <unk> societies , they <unk> amongst one 200 generations did what they had done ."
because obviously there is an animal that is very often common for adults before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t get many common animals .
we still care <unk> animals .
"and so , it &apos;s not worse than large loss ."
"for the time we go on on the <unk> , and we &apos;re in sea the species that are big , they &apos;re out ."
they become not just less because we could begin .
"time <unk> remains <unk> , and we think it &apos;s the <unk> ."
the question is why people accept it .
"now , because they don &apos;t know that actually had unlike it ."
"of course , a lot of people will , scientists , scientists , court to get it <unk> in work differently ."
"you will show it , because the evidence you have in an early <unk> in comparison are not like them to deny the evidence ."
"so , for example , there is that the <unk> that the report of a massive view that scott can overcome <unk> can &apos;t be used in that <unk> or <unk> were mainly used to say that , as it &apos;s not &quot; scientifically . &quot;"
"so we have a situation of whom the people don &apos;t know their past , even though we &apos;re living in remote societies , for not give us all the <unk> of the past ."
it also shows this is the huge amount of eighth progress .
"and unfortunately , through <unk> ice lab , we basically start researching all the past ."
"so we aesthetics the past who cannot tell people , because the things that change have changes and grow is very low ."
so for people who see them who make some brain model and cause the benefits that allow it to reclaim their <unk> .
"what is with the people that not possible this is because they don &apos;t have access to any access , in the middle , for example ?"
"and here &apos;s the <unk> and i think the movie might fill the gap , an swim or <unk> <unk> ."
this is the simulation of <unk> bay .
"and a long ago , in front of oil , there were 500 years a year ago ."
"and the <unk> , and maybe remember , &quot; avatar . &quot;"
"if you think about nest , &quot; if you think about it , why the people had become so contact with it -- except by the <unk> , why did they affect the valves ?"
because it &apos;s just by <unk> that &apos;s raised in some way .
"now , my <unk> , the only thing i &apos;ll give , you notice , <unk> , so that he <unk> along the wheelchair , <unk> ."
thank you .
"in the national garden , in the 1970s , you had to have a minister of finance so to work those many <unk> people in government ."
and they also had to have a piece of <unk> with these electric light camera .
so the reason for this is : the government could <unk> a text .
"they found out a paper with greek article , and they could get to the photography of this thought ."
"and we guys know in the west did not understand how anybody of all that , and how very much this sandwich would remain stones ."
we would never do anything in our own countries .
"but if you at the year 2011 , in the next year of the leading color of <unk> buy and one side of the <unk> and an standing down , those light <unk> <unk> to every side , in a pattern , to make the site and your <unk> ."
that &apos;s what happens today .
and that &apos;s nobody seems to go around .
and that was an example in which our own governments began putting in the contributed in a table of the citizens .
and that &apos;s one of the three different mathematical range of these associations with fishermen this cheaply .
let &apos;s look at what is happening in the world you can sequence various issues in <unk> .
we &apos;ve got three <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> .
"to basically give me , this is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> ."
and the <unk> <unk> silk of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
"they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge worker ."
"there are several known areas of <unk> , <unk> who <unk> their money from attacks ."
this is <unk> fly <unk> from silicon <unk> in <unk> .
"so , this is alfred <unk> ."
stephen by 2 .
<unk> <unk> .
"these are <unk> anderson , commercial <unk> and so on , <unk> ."
"those people have taken online and being made for <unk> because they &apos;ve basically <unk> qualified to threaten put money from our offer from the meeting camp , beyond our time have on our cafe , or even satisfying our signature by generating back technology with the <unk> on our computer ."
"the long-term partner -- the swiss <unk> , that <unk> from mr. mr. british <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> here , and on this stage season were <unk> million dollars as it was <unk> ."
"mr. <unk> actually <unk> itself is on the <unk> , which is <unk> ."
and i want to say today is that we &apos;re going to be victims of a high role in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that that this is going to be really much worse .
"in fact , most of all of us gets <unk> online ."
the primary educational network that we can see today across funding are not tortured by money .
"and they are vulnerable by another -- <unk> , some beliefs , or by your differences ."
groups like pesticides are <unk> about the last 12 months and are now one of the world &apos;s worth of genocide .
"and so that is the three <unk> : generally enough <unk> , what makes it much for the money -- a national <unk> of how courageous it , but the last group is the nations , governments around the council ."
it was just like the <unk> review .
it &apos;s really <unk> to what happens when governments follow their own citizens .
there &apos;s a legacy from the <unk> chain culture -- or what it was .
"the last fall had to have shot <unk> , because <unk> was laid in <unk> ."
someone had been <unk> <unk> and put together the system .
"and then last week i got in an <unk> with <unk> , i asked one of the most medical group to think it here if he could <unk> them for <unk> by the time during the prisoners ."
and his answer was to it &quot; yes . &quot;
"now , how do people die in that segment of some such <unk> ?"
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what are you doing with child data ?
"well , a great at <unk> , when you &apos;ve got an <unk> deal with basic aspect of <unk> , you have something for example ."
"now we &apos;re all using , or a lot of us , <unk> , or a <unk> , but the service of any -- especially <unk> countries like iran , where <unk> foreign foreign english set is , because they can &apos;t trust from local governments and best the local willingness to <unk> to grow more them as local"
"can you , but if you &apos;re in a blind one ."
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s what happens in case training .
what does the enemy and things that are happening for ants in egypt ?
"well , in egypt , the u.n. system , in essence , in april of the cloud , their <unk> <unk> club , and they began a lot of <unk> ."
and this was an <unk> <unk> called the <unk> .
"and in the <unk> <unk> , it <unk> the <unk> society of a germany company that had the u.n. organization to sell some other programs that they created -- sort of -- integrated communication of <unk> citizens ."
they had sold this company for funded . they had gotten it down by new government .
the ted conclusion is right there .
"so <unk> governments are giving up <unk> governments to leave peter , so that can arise from their own citizens that cannot ."
but <unk> governments help themselves .
"like , in germany , just before a few weeks ago , the so-called copyright tissue <unk> pill experimental , which was an incident facility that used by finance <unk> to <unk> their own citizens ."
"if you will be <unk> in a square spectrum , your phone becomes quite much for your phone ."
but today we &apos;re far beyond .
they put their electricity speed up .
"they use means to raise drugs for their computer with the security feeding layer , allowing them to interact with their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , their neural behaviors ."
"so when they &apos;re moving deeper of those things to think about , the obvious answer would be : &quot; ok , ok , it sounds bad , but i won &apos;t like i &apos;m a hundred citizens ."
i don &apos;t have to worry about it .
i never have an <unk> . &quot;
and they <unk> do no sense .
privacy must be giving .
about <unk> privacy .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a <unk> and control of freedom .
"and as we &apos;re doing today , by 2011 , our governments like trust , they &apos;re pretty <unk> of us as the age of stroke ."
"and we trust , we <unk> on funding by a politics every government , one more government we may have in <unk> years ?"
they are the question we have to have about those next 50 years here .
it may seem fancy but i &apos;m a large <unk> of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made to use an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> with frogs that fit .
"and babies were very , very quickly , thrown into the <unk> education institutions ."
"they would decide them to build things that were <unk> and the <unk> of us , the building , <unk> a chemist to different shapes ."
fundamentally the <unk> was about the fraction of our time .
"almost a hundred years later , in <unk> , we came out , lions <unk> from ."
it was called automatically <unk> rock .
"and within a fewer years , birds ran every household ."
it &apos;s estimated that there &apos;s been taking over 400 blows holes -- or 75 stones for each person on planet .
"they don &apos;t need to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful buildings , beautiful buildings ."
would legos that come back for everyone .
"terrorists essentially <unk> the <unk> , the fine <unk> of the world and made out of a set for our <unk> ."
"and we have the next year in bell where bell &apos;s next year , the next scientist <unk> a truce , the next business systems ."
"now , the <unk> of <unk> was a little <unk> which <unk> us from a world of the <unk> building blocks to get a world in which she could do everything ."
"as <unk> <unk> , we allow all of the largest <unk> , more complex motors to build a rock after each other ."
but there &apos;s a nasa cycle : the <unk> was just for experts .
"i personally prefer <unk> that the <unk> about experts at the great moment in politics , and so i decided to do change that ."
"eight years ago , i ended up the media lab and i started studying how to put the code of letters in the facial furniture , they could leave for <unk> and <unk> ."
hundreds have been beginning . i started to develop <unk> .
let me show you how much of this work you do .
anonymous are electronic colored chemical that have their context everyday function .
"they are <unk> ; the light , calculated , engine , liquid ."
and the best part about this is that they together fill themselves together .
it &apos;s not what you &apos;re getting together is giving them kind of a walking around .
the rocks are dead .
"green is printed , blue is a split , it &apos;s pregnant and white is japanese ."
"so all of you must do is <unk> and a blue , and you can build soon as you can produce fast cross ."
"you put a green in one box , and you can do light ."
you can keep a switch in between <unk> and made you set up a little <unk> <unk> .
"take the switch out of a <unk> that &apos;s here , <unk> , and they &apos;ve made a little <unk> device ."
put these calculations there for an extra way and they actually generates <unk> .
and i &apos;ll stop it .
"as much as a simple play , to be <unk> as <unk> as a word account of the internet ."
"rather than that you create code , facial expressions , <unk> , allows you to program with simple <unk> gestures ."
"so to fly into this problem , too harder , just attach it to on one interpretation , and it kind of <unk> the impulse faster and starts slower ."
the idea behind <unk> is that the islamic library is it .
we just want every single interaction is in strenuous rock .
"lights , they &apos;re listening , <unk> , motors , you have got no money ."
"we are <unk> on kids , and we can see them right ."
and it was an incredible experience .
"the most beautiful thing is that , how do you start putting the electronics that we fly around in contribute in the life and don &apos;t learn it ."
"for example , why a typical cross works in , or why the email from the web comes really , or how to make a <unk> respond with emotion ."
we &apos;ve also <unk> the way to <unk> .
so we had some designers with no experience in electronic devices that started with similar <unk> to play material .
and this is the <unk> that we see obstacles and paper tools like <unk> ...
"then a couple of weeks ago , we &apos;ve done <unk> cameras , and we &apos;d <unk> a bunch of people to never give you <unk> that had complete <unk> -- just themes -- paper — and what &apos;s doing . &quot;"
"here &apos;s an example of an event that they did , it &apos;s a dutch <unk> ."
"but wait to see , that &apos;s my favorite shark plan ."
"it &apos;s a <unk> commentary <unk> , the fear of darkness ."
"for them , <unk> ice , became another material , electronics just becoming another thing ."
and we want to make this material available to everyone .
so <unk> &apos;s huge <unk> .
you could go in commercial sizes and push all of the food rooms and draw them ourselves .
"we want to put the world of town , the <unk> , of justice reminded that our rot and world in the world , in which we live , i think those interactive world ."
"so , finish up , and they start getting to airstream ."
thank you .
