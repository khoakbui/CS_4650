"you know , one of the big <unk> at travel , and one of the <unk> research is at <unk> with people who remember the old days can still remember the ancient days , the <unk> , they &apos;re still <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> ."
"and the idea that <unk> is still beyond the milky way , or the importance of the <unk> of <unk> is still full of meaning , or that in the himalayas is still <unk> , the way , the essence of <unk> is to <unk> the essence of memory ."
and of course we all share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we go through <unk> .
"we need to <unk> with the <unk> separation through death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , <unk> and art ."
"but interesting is the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , the rhythm of <unk> in every culture ."
"and it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in a <unk> , or a <unk> in the middle of the sahara ."
"all of these people teach us that there are other <unk> , other <unk> , different ways of <unk> on earth ."
"and this is an idea that if you think about it , you can only meet you ."
"together the <unk> cultures of the world make a web of <unk> and <unk> life , the earth <unk> , and for the earth &apos;s important , as the biological <unk> , as you know , as the biological <unk> ."
"you can think of this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , and <unk> as the <unk> of all thoughts and dreams , myths and <unk> and <unk> that are <unk> by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness ."
the <unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
"it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are , and what we &apos;re amazing as <unk> species ."
"and just as the biosphere has been <unk> , this happened with the <unk> -- only with greater speed ."
"no <unk> , for example , would say that 50 percent of all sorts of species are extinct just before , because it &apos;s just right . and yet , this -- the <unk> area in the area of <unk> -- <unk> -- hardly the diversity of life , which is <unk> -- the <unk> , for example --"
and the <unk> <unk> for that is the extinct languages .
"when each of you were born in this room , they were spoken on earth ."
"now , a language is not just the <unk> of the <unk> or a series of <unk> ."
a language is the expression of human <unk> .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a particular culture finds access to the world .
"every language is like a <unk> forest of the <unk> , a <unk> , a thought of an ecosystem <unk> ."
"and from these <unk> languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , that half is no longer in the ears ."
"they won &apos;t be taught anymore . this means that if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead ."
"what could be lonely lonely than being <unk> to be one of the last <unk> of your <unk> talking , your language , do not have a chance to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or to expect the hope ?"
"and yet , in fact , this horrible fate of the earth is actually <unk> someone anywhere on earth , about two weeks , because of all two weeks , every single person , a older person , and takes the last old language to the grave ."
"and i know that some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; if we &apos;re not a better place when we &apos;re just going to speak to a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; good language ."
let &apos;s face it . &quot;
and then suddenly you would see how it would be if you could not talk your own language .
"that &apos;s why i want to take you on a journey today through the <unk> , a short trip through the <unk> to try to make them <unk> , which was actually lost ."
"now there are some of us who <unk> forget that when i say , &quot; different ways of being , &quot; really different possibilities of his own ."
"for example , take this kid &apos;s <unk> <unk> in the northwest of the amazon <unk> , the people of the <unk> believe that they were <unk> the <unk> from the east of <unk> <unk> ."
"this is a people that &apos;s not cognitively cognitively between the colors blue and green , because the <unk> of the forest is <unk> on which people are <unk> ."
"they have a <unk> language , and a <unk> called the <unk> <unk> , you have to marry someone who talks to another language ."
"all of this is in the <unk> past , and the <unk> of these big houses , where they are talking about six or seven or seven or seven languages , but that you never hear someone who is a language ."
you just hear and start talking .
"or , one of the most amazing tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , an astonishing people that was <unk> in the year ."
"in <unk> <unk> , five <unk> were trying to record and made a <unk> mistake ."
"they were <unk> <unk> pictures of <unk> from the air , which we would <unk> as a friendly gesture , and <unk> them that people from the rainforest in their lives had never seen something <unk> ."
"they <unk> these photographs of <unk> , trying to figure out the face or the character , they found nothing and <unk> that this is the <unk> of the <unk> and killing the five <unk> with the <unk> ."
but the <unk> killed not just <unk> with the <unk> .
they <unk> each other .
<unk> percent of the deaths happened through <unk> .
"we <unk> the <unk> eight generations back , and we found two cases of a natural <unk> , and as we <unk> people with a <unk> about it , they were <unk> that one of the people had become so high because he died when he died ."
but at the same time they had a clear <unk> of the <unk> that was amazing .
"their <unk> were able to smell the <unk> of an animal from 40 <unk> distance , and determine what <unk> was of this <unk> ."
"in the early years of time , i got a really amazing job when my professor asked me whether i was interested in going to go to haiti and <unk> the secret societies that were <unk> from the strength of <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ."
"so to give a sense to this <unk> , of course , i had to have something about this remarkable belief in the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> is no <unk> of the black magic ."
"in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex <unk> <unk> ."
it &apos;s interesting .
"if i &apos;d ask you , the great <unk> <unk> , what would you say ?"
"<unk> , islam , <unk> , <unk> , whatever ."
"a continent will always <unk> , because the <unk> was that there was no religious belief in sub-saharan africa , of course , there was a <unk> of that very <unk> of this very profound thoughts that <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> ."
but what <unk> is so interesting is that living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
"the <unk> can be <unk> under the big water , respond to the rhythm of the <unk> to <unk> to <unk> the soul of living , so that the <unk> will be <unk> for a short moment ."
"<unk> would like to say the <unk> , &quot; your white goes to church and talk about god ."
we dance in the temple and will god . &quot;
"and because you &apos;ve been obsessed , you &apos;re going to take away from your mind . how can you do damage ?"
"and look at this amazing <unk> : <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> of coal without any <unk> , an amazing <unk> of the <unk> of the body to affect the body , that it will be <unk> when it <unk> in a <unk> state ."
"now , from all the people i &apos;ve met were the temple in the sierra <unk> de <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> ."
"<unk> the ancient <unk> civilization , the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and in the <unk> , the <unk> moved back to the people in a massive <unk> of <unk> <unk> that is <unk> ."
"in a <unk> continent , these people were the only one that had never been <unk> by <unk> ."
"until today &apos;s day , they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> <unk> . education is very extraordinary ."
"the young <unk> in the age of three and four years from their families are separated by a <unk> world of <unk> , in <unk> of <unk> , for 18 years , <unk> <unk> , two years of her <unk> , on the <unk> , on nine months ."
"and while all of this time , they become <unk> into the values of their society , the values that <unk> that their <unk> and their <unk> , their own <unk> -- or we could say <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> ."
"at the end of this amazing <unk> , you will take a day out , and for the first time in your life , at the age of 18 , you see a <unk> moment of consciousness , and in the first moment , it <unk> on the sun <unk> ."
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
"what they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , the destruction of the world ."
now this level of <unk> is very important .
"whenever we think about <unk> and landscape , we &apos;re either <unk> , and the old <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , which is in his <unk> , a <unk> thought , or say , these are more connected with nature ."
"well , <unk> are not <unk> , yet they &apos;re <unk> by <unk> ."
"it doesn &apos;t remain much in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or the cold <unk> of <unk> , but still , through time and ritual <unk> of the earth , which doesn &apos;t be <unk> to the idea that it can be <unk> to the earth , because it doesn &apos;t exist in a <unk> the earth , it"
"well , what does that mean ?"
"it means that a little child from the <unk> that <unk> up into the <unk> is that the mountain is a <unk> that will determine its <unk> , will become a very different person , and a different relationship in this resource , or a little relationship of that resource ."
"whether it &apos;s a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> ."
the interesting thing is the metaphor that <unk> the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and believed that these forests are <unk> to become <unk> .
"and that made me to another person than my friends in the <unk> , who believe that those forests are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the world , who would be <unk> to their <unk> ."
"now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different <unk> , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant ."
it &apos;s a photograph i took only last april of the amazon .
"this is <unk> , from many of you have heard , the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> ."
"what <unk> is doing so <unk> is not just the <unk> potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s really made out of two sources , and on one side , there &apos;s this <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> by <unk> , <unk> , which is a <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which"
"this plant contains some very strong <unk> that <unk> the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are very similar ."
"if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this substance that you &apos;re making of different kinds of different species ."
"this <unk> to <unk> is something like being <unk> from a <unk> <unk> , <unk> from <unk> and <unk> at a sea of electricity ."
"it &apos;s not going to produce <unk> from reality , but the resolution of reality ."
"i even have with my professor , richard <unk> <unk> , the man , who <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the magic <unk> in mexico , in mexico , was <unk> , and i said that you couldn &apos;t <unk> this <unk> as a <unk> ."
"but the thing about <unk> is that they can &apos;t be <unk> because they <unk> through the human gut of course , they &apos;re called <unk> , <unk> ."
you can only be <unk> with some other chemicals that <unk> the mao <unk> .
"now the amazing thing is that the <unk> that have in these <unk> are <unk> , <unk> of the kind of things that are necessary to <unk> the <unk> . ask yourself ."
"so how can these people from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> species , these two <unk> plants find two <unk> plants that combine when in this way , create a kind of <unk> version , such that the whole version of its parts ?"
"we &apos;re using these great <unk> , trying and we &apos;re trying to figure out what <unk> ."
"but you ask the indian people say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;"
so what does that mean ?
"this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 <unk> of <unk> that you all recognize in the forest at large distance that appear for our eyes as a form ."
"and then they ask them , as they <unk> their <unk> , and they say , &quot; i thought you know something about plants ."
"i mean , you know nothing ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;"
"so , it turns out that you &apos;re <unk> each of the 17 <unk> <unk> and you sing them into a different <unk> ."
"now , that doesn &apos;t get a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> ."
"well , the <unk> problem is that , even among us , the <unk> for the difficult to <unk> , have to look at them as <unk> and <unk> , they sort of <unk> to the past , as the real world , our world ."
"so , the fact is that you don &apos;t remember the 20th century , in 300 years , you don &apos;t remember this <unk> , or technological innovation , but rather than a era in which we were <unk> , and the massive destruction of the cultural economy ."
all cultures have come back to the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
"the <unk> didn &apos;t hear less on the sioux than they were <unk> and arrow , than the americans were to be americans , as they were <unk> americans and <unk> ."
"not change and technology <unk> the integrity of the <unk> , and it is power . the <unk> face of <unk> ."
"and even in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not the <unk> <unk> . these are <unk> peoples whose existence is <unk> by <unk> forces that <unk> to their capacity to <unk> their capacity , and to be <unk> , whether it <unk> ."
"or when we go to the mountains of <unk> where i &apos;m going to see much more <unk> , you will see the <unk> face of political <unk> ."
"you know , the genocide that is going to be <unk> by people , but the <unk> , the destruction of the people , the destruction of the people , not only is not only <unk> , but in general as part of a <unk> ."
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering <unk> if you don &apos;t have a <unk> level .
"i went to <unk> with a young fellow <unk> miles from <unk> to <unk> after <unk> after <unk> , and when i first looked at the face , i saw the face of the statistics of which you were <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> into <unk> ."
the father of this <unk> was <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> .
that meant that he was <unk> immediately in the chinese <unk> .
"your uncle is your uncle , in the diaspora , who brought people to nepal ."
his mother became <unk> as a <unk> for -- for the crime .
"he was <unk> in the age of two years of <unk> to <unk> under her <unk> , because they couldn &apos;t live him ."
the sister who did this <unk> <unk> was put into a <unk> .
"and one day , she <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , and for those <unk> , she had to <unk> her for seven years ."
"the suffering can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people is something ."
"and at the end , we &apos;re really a choice . we &apos;d like to live in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity ?"
"<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> said before she died that it &apos;s the greatest fear that as we move towards a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , we were not just <unk> the entire <unk> of human imagination , but it was going to see a <unk> view ."
"and it &apos;s <unk> to think that maybe our species have existed for 600,000 years ."
"the <unk> revolution that brought us in agriculture , and in this moment , the <unk> of the <unk> , the poetry of <unk> through the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , found just 10,000 years ago ."
the modern industrial world as we know it &apos;s almost 300 years old .
"now , this <unk> story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have the answers to the challenges that we &apos;re in the <unk> ."
"if we ask these <unk> <unk> to the importance of the <unk> questions , they respond to 10,000 different voices ."
"and in this song , we &apos;re going to be the opportunity to be what we are : people with <unk> awareness that are aware of all the importance of all people and gardens to be <unk> and <unk> ."
"here &apos;s a photo i took at the end of the <unk> end of the <unk> when i went to the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story ."
"the <unk> government is not always very well with the <unk> , and during the <unk> years of the <unk> of our <unk> , they were <unk> in <unk> ."
and the grandfather of this <unk> man .
"the family , the <unk> of his life , took him all the guns and all the tools ."
"now , you have to know that the <unk> don &apos;t worry about the cold . they <unk> them to their advantage ."
the <unk> of their <unk> were originally <unk> from fish that was made in <unk> .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather doesn &apos;t <unk> from the <unk> night or the storm .
"he <unk> out after out , took his pants out of <unk> and <unk> into his hand , and when the <unk> began to <unk> , he <unk> them into the shape of a <unk> ."
"he <unk> on the pages of the <unk> , and when it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog ."
"he took the dog , and he took a <unk> , and he took the skeleton of the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> , <unk> a different dog and <unk> the <unk> on the <unk> <unk> ."
so you can &apos;t do anything .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the <unk> and all of the <unk> in the world .
the <unk> government gave the <unk> in april of the <unk> control over an area that &apos;s bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new home and called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . it &apos;s all <unk> .
"an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can <unk> with his <unk> and can achieve ."
"and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who went to this distant goals from the earth to realize they &apos;re not removed at all ."
they are the <unk> of somebody .
"they represent parts of the human imagination that are <unk> in <unk> times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children are , like the dreams of our own children &apos;s own part of the cosmos ."
and what we &apos;re trying to do with national geographic is that we believe that politicians never do anything .
"we think <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not <unk> , but we believe that <unk> can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for <unk> in the world . we get 35 million dollars a month ."
<unk> nations <unk> our <unk> .
our magazines are read by millions .
"and we do a series of travels into the <unk> that we take our audience from places of such cultural wonder that they <unk> from the <unk> , and hopefully they will be <unk> to a <unk> on the other <unk> of the world of <unk> that <unk> that <unk> ."
thank you .
"so what i first show you , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we have , as a part of a <unk> in a year , and that &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> in a small environment ."
"we see many , many <unk> on digital photos here that can be <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in a way ."
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how big these <unk> are or how big the images are .
"most of them are digital <unk> of a camera , but this one is an example of the <unk> of <unk> and it &apos;s in a field of 300 <unk> ."
"it doesn &apos;t make a difference , because the only thing that the performance of a system like that i can , is the number of <unk> on your screen at every moment , and it has a very flexible architecture ."
"this is a whole book , an example of <unk> ."
this is <unk> house by <unk> . every <unk> is a chapter .
"to prove that it &apos;s actually about a text and not a picture , we can do something like this to show that this is a real <unk> of <unk> and a picture ."
maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t <unk> it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
"and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of a <unk> of a magazine or reading a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with several <unk> ."
we &apos;ve also made something at the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
"we &apos;ve designed a wrong <unk> with very high <unk> that &apos;s much higher than a normal display , and we have some <unk> content ."
"if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see here ."
"or other models , or even <unk> <unk> ."
"and this really <unk> these ideas , this <unk> for the <unk> place on the screen ."
we hope that that &apos;s not <unk> and other <unk> -- that should be necessary .
"and of course , the <unk> is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this ."
"and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re also going to do that ."
but these are all roads in the <unk> .
<unk> on the top of the nasa image .
so let &apos;s give you something else .
now this is actually live on the internet . you can <unk> it .
"this is a project called <unk> , which actually connects two different technologies together ."
"one is <unk> , and the other one is a very good research about <unk> , <unk> by noah , a <unk> of washington university , under the <unk> of steve <unk> at the <unk> ."
and rick <unk> of microsoft research was done . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
"you can see that when we create this kind of <unk> that we can <unk> through pictures , and make that experience of <unk> ."
but the <unk> <unk> of the pictures here is actually meaning .
"the <unk> have <unk> these pictures together so they <unk> the real space , where these pictures , all around the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> to be here , and they see these <unk> elements of <unk> and <unk> and all these <unk> ."
i don &apos;t know exactly whether i &apos;ve been able to show you other environments .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
"i &apos;d like to show you one of the most <unk> <unk> of noah , and this is from a early <unk> that we first worked on in the summer to show you what i think it &apos;s really , and that &apos;s where the <unk> of the technology ."
we had to worry about lawyers and so on .
"this is a <unk> of the cathedral <unk> lady that just <unk> in the computer with <unk> . just give you <unk> lady in a <unk> , and they become <unk> pictures of men in <unk> and on the <unk> , and each picture , a <unk> , <unk> ."
"so these are all <unk> , and they &apos;re all <unk> in this way ."
and we can <unk> this very simple way .
". you know , i &apos;ve never believed that i ultimately will work at microsoft ."
i &apos;m very grateful for the <unk> here .
"i guess you can see that these are a lot of different kinds of cameras : all of them are available to professional <unk> , a pretty large number of them that were <unk> in this environment ."
and if i can find some of the <unk> .
many of you are <unk> with faces and so forth .
there &apos;s a series of photographs here -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of <unk> lady that was recorded right .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
"so the point here is that we can do things with social environment , and it &apos;s going to take data from all the data -- from all the <unk> of it -- the way the earth looks -- and everything is connected ."
"and all of these photographs are connected , and it creates something larger than the sum of the parts ."
they get a model that comes from all over the earth .
look at this as the sequel of work from stephen <unk> on earth .
"and this is something that <unk> by complexity using people using it , and its use for using the user is going to get bigger ."
their own photographs will be <unk> with <unk> <unk> that another person has <unk> .
"if somebody did the <unk> and <unk> all of those sacred <unk> , who are all <unk> , then my photograph of <unk> , suddenly <unk> with all of that data , and i can use them as <unk> , and i can use them into another <unk> ."
"and of course , <unk> all of that are the <unk> <unk> virtual <unk> of every interesting part of the earth that has not only been <unk> by <unk> or <unk> and so forth , but by <unk> <unk> ."
thank you .
"do i understand it right ? the software that allows you to be at a certain time , within the next years , all pictures that are used to be used by someone in the world in principle ."
yes . it doesn &apos;t do anything else .
if they want to make them <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of the <unk> in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting if you think about the <unk> of the <unk> information that many of these pictures have .
"how do you make a <unk> for images , where you put them together , and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what the image is ."
but how would it be if the picture is connected to all of your pictures ?
"then the <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> and the <unk> that makes it , really , enormously enormous . it &apos;s a <unk> ."
"blaise , this is really incredibly . congratulations ."
thank you very much .
"i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book that i hope in <unk> with other things that you &apos;ve heard already , and i &apos;m going to try to create a couple of connections if you don &apos;t know those ."
i want to start with what i call &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the <unk> <unk> of what ?
the <unk> <unk> of all the western societies .
"the <unk> system works so that , if our goal is to be the <unk> of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the freedom of freedom ."
"the reason that is that freedom in itself is good , it makes valuable , a <unk> <unk> for human ."
"when people have freedom , then each of us is to do with ourselves to do the things that our <unk> and no one has given to us ."
the way to <unk> freedom is too choice .
"the more <unk> people , the more freedom you have , and the more freedom they have , the more <unk> they have ."
"this is , i think , so deep in our <unk> that there would be no point in the sense of meaning ."
and it &apos;s also deeply in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us progress .
this is my <unk> . no big one .
i just want to say a little bit about <unk> .
"there are no <unk> in my <unk> , if you don &apos;t <unk> the 10 different <unk> and 12 <unk> that you could buy for a large number of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> case that no one is in the right store ."
so that &apos;s like <unk> .
"and then they go to the <unk> store , a <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . and there &apos;s a lot of <unk> ."
we can <unk> <unk> millions of different <unk> from the components that are offered in this business .
they have to <unk> that this is a big <unk> .
"in other areas , the world of communication ."
"there was a time when i was a boy , you could have <unk> every phone that you wanted when it came from <unk> bell ."
they <unk> their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of it was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
"now we have almost an infinite <unk> of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones ."
these are the mobile phones of the future .
"my <unk> is the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"and if you haven &apos;t seen that in your business , you can be sure you will soon be ."
and what it does is it <unk> people to walk in business and ask this question .
do you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a <unk> that doesn &apos;t do too much .
"in different aspects of life , which are very much more <unk> than buying from <unk> , the same <unk> of choice ."
"health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that they &apos;re going to go to a doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do ."
"instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says we could make a or we could make b ."
a <unk> has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
"and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;"
"the doctor says , a has the benefits and risks and b has the benefits and risks ."
what do you want to do ?
"and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;"
"the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;"
"and the result is -- we call it the physical autonomy . that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , one of the burden of responsibility for making some choices from somebody knows something -- not a doctor -- that doesn &apos;t tell you the best ."
"there is an enormous marketing marketing for people like you and me , that if you think about it , no sense of it , because we don &apos;t buy them ."
why do you <unk> us if we can &apos;t buy ?
"and the answer is : you expect from the <unk> to the next morning , and to ask a change of the <unk> ."
"something like our identity , like our identity is now a question of what this slide is to show ."
"we don &apos;t <unk> identity , we invent it ."
and we <unk> ourselves as often as we want .
"that means that every day , if you leave the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be ."
"in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in which the <unk> was that almost everybody had one , and they could <unk> as fast as they could , and then they could get kids as fast as they could ."
"the only real choice was , &quot; who , not when , and not what they did afterwards ."
"today , everything &apos;s easy to have ."
"i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to ."
"and they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less smart , and they &apos;re not carefully carefully ."
"it &apos;s because they &apos;re <unk> with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; am i going to marry marry ? should i ?"
"should i marry later ? should i only have children , or do a career ? &quot;"
they &apos;re all <unk> questions .
"and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether this means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you a good note in my class ."
"and in fact , they should do this . these are important questions about questions ."
"work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl <unk> , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every day to work on the planet -- up to the <unk> hotel ."
there &apos;s a corner by the way that i &apos;m not going to talk to you about the <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you it because i want to use it .
"so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions and again and again , whether we should work or should not work ."
"we can play our kids with <unk> , and we have our mobile phone on the <unk> , and our <unk> to others on our own , and our laptop would probably be on our own ."
"and even if you &apos;re all <unk> , every minute in which we ask our child at the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> , we should ask ourselves , &quot; should i call that <unk> ?"
should i answer this letter ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
"and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is it certainly certainly your experience of your child &apos;s experience very different than it was ."
"everywhere we <unk> , big things and little things , <unk> things and <unk> , life is a question ."
and the world that we lived in .
"i want to say that there were some <unk> , but not everything was a question of choice ."
and the world that we see now lives .
"and the question is , are the good or bad news ?"
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
"we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to be bad about it ."
"all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people ."
"an effect , <unk> way , is that it &apos;s happening to free ."
"so with so many <unk> that you can choose , it falls to people very hard to decide ."
"i &apos;ll give you another <unk> example of this , a study about investment in volunteers ."
"a <unk> of me had access to <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of about a million <unk> and about 2,000 different jobs ."
"and what she found was a 10 <unk> who took care of <unk> , took two percent off ."
they offer 50 <unk> <unk> -- 10 percent less <unk> than if they only offer five . why ?
"because there are 50 <unk> who are <unk> to the <unk> , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you &apos;re going to choose that it is in tomorrow ."
"and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never ."
"you understand that this is not just about food that people have to eat <unk> when they go to the <unk> , because they don &apos;t have enough money to <unk> , it &apos;s so hard to make decisions that it is so hard to make their <unk> ."
"by not spending them to 5,000 dollars per year from the <unk> that would have been happy ."
paralysis is a consequence of many <unk> .
and i think it <unk> that the world looks like that .
"they want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s for all <unk> , right ?"
"they don &apos;t want to pick the false <unk> , or do the wrong thing ."
"so that &apos;s the effect . the other effect is that even when we get through the paralysis and make a decision , we end less <unk> with the outcome of <unk> as if we had the possibility of the opportunity to make the opportunity ."
and there are several reasons for this .
"one of them is <unk> through the major <unk> <unk> , when they buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and <unk> is already perfect ? it &apos;s just easy to imagine that they had a decision that would have better decision ."
"the more opportunities there are , the more simple , it &apos;s nothing to regret at all , that &apos;s <unk> for the choice they make ."
"second , what economists call <unk> ."
dan <unk> has made a big point today by telling how much the way we <unk> things depends on what we compare it .
"all right , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think , it &apos;s just <unk> properties of alternatives that <unk> them less <unk> with the alternatives that they <unk> ."
"here &apos;s an example . for you who are not new yorker , i &apos;m <unk> ."
but here &apos;s what you should think .
here &apos;s some of the <unk> .
very expensive <unk> .
<unk> beach . great day . you have everything for yourself .
"what could be better ? &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s <unk> ."
everyone in my <unk> neighborhood is gone away .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s spending two weeks weeks from the thought he <unk> the ability to have a day of a great parking lot .
"<unk> <unk> the <unk> that we get through our <unk> , even though what we &apos;ve been fantastic ."
"and the more opportunities to the <unk> , the more <unk> of these <unk> are <unk> in the <unk> ."
here &apos;s another example .
"now , this <unk> does some tell you ."
"he makes a statement about it now , and maybe to do things slowly ."
"but one more important point that he &apos;s doing : whenever you choose for one thing , you don &apos;t decide ."
"and these other things like many <unk> properties , and it will do what they &apos;re going to do less <unk> ."
three : <unk> of expectations .
this was struck me when i wanted to <unk> my <unk> .
"i <unk> <unk> , almost all the time ."
"and there was a time in which there was only <unk> of a <unk> , and they bought them , and they were incredibly <unk> , and they were incredibly <unk> , and when they had long enough , and they had started <unk> ."
"so to buy new <unk> after many years of the <unk> , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some <unk> here , here &apos;s my size . &quot;"
"and the <unk> said , &quot; do you want <unk> , easy or <unk> ?"
do you want to <unk> or <unk> ? stone or <unk> ?
do you want to <unk> with <unk> ?
"if you want to go down far , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; and so on ."
"my <unk> was down , and after i said , &quot; i would like to have the kind of thing that used to be . &quot;"
"he didn &apos;t know what that was , so i spent an hour so i spent all this <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the business -- and i &apos;ll tell the truth -- with the <unk> <unk> that i &apos;ve ever had ."
i did it better . all of those <unk> allowed me to have it better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
"the reason that i felt was bad with all these available opportunities , my expectations for what a lot of <unk> went up ."
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have any concrete expectations when they were in one way .
"when they came in 100 species , <unk> , one of them would have been perfect ."
"and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect ."
"and so i <unk> what i had had to do with what i expected , and what i had been <unk> in compared to what i expected ."
and the add of opportunities to people &apos;s lives in the lives of the people that people have the expectations of how good they will be .
"and this leads to less <unk> with the <unk> , even though the results are good ."
"no one in the world knows this . because if you knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what it is ."
the truth is more like this .
"the reason that it was all better than anything was worse than everything was bad , it was possible for the people to do a surprise ."
"today , in the world we live -- we have wealthy citizens , <unk> with <unk> , with <unk> -- the best for you to hope is so good as you are ."
"they will never feel <unk> because their expectations , my expectations are <unk> ."
the secret to the <unk> -- which is what they all came from -- the secret to <unk> is low expectations .
"i want to say -- a short moment of -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and it &apos;s really wonderful ."
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t have <unk> .
but <unk> is not always such a bad thing .
"and finally , one of the <unk> <unk> of a bad <unk> , if there &apos;s only one kind of <unk> that if you &apos;re <unk> , and you ask questions , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear . what do you know ?"
"if hundreds of different kinds of <unk> are available , and you buy the <unk> , and you &apos;re asking why ? who is responsible ?"
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : it .
they could do better .
"with 100 different kinds of <unk> in <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes ."
"and so , when people make decisions , and also when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about them ."
clinical <unk> in the industrial world over the last generation .
"i think a <unk> -- not the only one , but a <unk> <unk> to this <unk> of depression , and also <unk> , is that people have learned the <unk> because their standards are so high , and then they have to teach them that experience ."
"and so the <unk> is that we &apos;re actually going to do better , <unk> , and we feel bad ."
so let me remind you .
"this is the <unk> <unk> , which we all think is right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true ."
"there &apos;s no question , which is better than not , but it &apos;s not <unk> that much more <unk> than something else ."
there &apos;s a <unk> lot . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m quite sure that we &apos;ve missed that point a long time to improve our <unk> .
"now , when a <unk> question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as an <unk> question that &apos;s about thinking . what all of these <unk> is possible in the developing societies is the developed world ."
"there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard many of you who are not the problem of big <unk> ."
your problem is that they have too little .
"so the things that i &apos;m talking about are a curious problem of modern , rich societies ."
and what &apos;s so <unk> and <unk> is : steve <unk> told you about how <unk> and hard to <unk> <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> of money .
"and what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not just that they don &apos;t help ."
they even do <unk> .
they worry about that we are worse .
"if something that allows people to make decisions about our society so much of making decisions about the societies in which people would have <unk> , not only would improve the lives of people , but will improve our lives ."
economists call this a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is going to be worried that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all these great <unk> <unk> us .
"<unk> , please read this <unk> , and , a <unk> person , says , &quot; ah ! what this fish do ?"
you don &apos;t know anything in that <unk> . &quot;
"<unk> <unk> , a <unk> view of the world -- and that is the way i read it first ."
"but the more i thought about it , the more i came to think of the guy knows something ."
"because the truth is that when you break the <unk> , that everything is possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis ."
"when you break the <unk> , it &apos;s so possible , you reduce the <unk> ."
they increase the paralysis and down the <unk> .
everybody needs a <unk> .
"this is almost limited to <unk> security -- probably for the fish , definitely for us ."
"but the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> is a recipe for <unk> , and i suspect , disaster ."
thank you very much .
"you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects already before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and about the discovery of new groups of genes ."
"in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve got the biology that we &apos;re going through the digital code , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code in a new stage of biology by <unk> and design ."
we &apos;ve always tried to ask <unk> questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think that a lot of <unk> have tried to understand and to do that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different <unk> to <unk> it up to the <unk> components .
"we &apos;ve created almost 20 years . when we sequenced the <unk> <unk> , the change from the <unk> world of biology to the computer ."
"now let &apos;s try to ask if we can live or can we create new life , from this digital universe ?"
"this is the map of a small organism , <unk> <unk> , that can have the smallest genome of a species that can <unk> itself in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to get this with a smaller genome ."
we &apos;ve done it over about a hundred genes of 500 or so that are here .
"but if we look at this <unk> map that is very easy , compared to our . trust me , that &apos;s easy , but if we look at all these genes that we &apos;re going to have to be very unlikely to the other ."
"so we decided that it &apos;s actually the only way to go forward to the front of this <unk> process , which allows us to <unk> the individual components , and so some of these <unk> questions ."
"and that &apos;s how we started with the question , can we make a <unk> ?"
does it allow chemistry to make these really large molecules that have never been made before ?
"and when we can do that , we can start the <unk> ?"
a <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material .
our steps at the <unk> of life were exponentially .
"and our ability to write the genetic code has evolved very slowly but still <unk> , and our last point would be now on a <unk> curve ."
we started that 15 years ago .
it actually took some years from starting with a <unk> <unk> before we did the first experiments .
it turns out that <unk> is very difficult .
"there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make the little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you get a piece of power ."
so we had to develop a new way that we could put these little pieces together and put the mistakes .
"this was our first trial , starting with the digital information , the genome <unk> x prize ."
it &apos;s a smaller virus that kills bacteria .
"we made little pieces . we made a <unk> and had a dna of about 5,000 letters ."
"the <unk> phase came when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> and we put it in a <unk> , and the <unk> started reading the genetic code and made <unk> ."
"the <unk> particles were then <unk> by the cells , and they were killing , and killing e. ."
"recently , i talked to the <unk> , and they said they said this model <unk> ."
they <unk> more than you do .
so we think that this is actually a situation in the software that can actually build their own <unk> system in a <unk> system .
"but we didn &apos;t want to go much further . we wanted to build a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s got more than <unk> genetic code . so we thought we &apos;re building it in <unk> of the size of the virus that we could change the size of the size we could <unk> ."
"design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , the digital information has to be really <unk> ."
"so when we sequenced the genome back in 1995 , the genome project in 1995 was <unk> by a mistake ."
"we found that in the <unk> of 30 <unk> , if we used the <unk> sequence , it would have never been possible ."
"a part of the <unk> is to make pieces of <unk> , the 50 letters are long , and the other <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have to build smaller <unk> ."
we have unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have <unk> <unk> .
"think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , <unk> and <unk>"
"<unk> this letters -- these letters <unk> about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single <unk> for each of these amino acids ."
"so we can use the genetic code to write our words , <unk> , thoughts ."
we have just <unk> .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
"we have the pieces so <unk> that we could just <unk> them with <unk> , and there are <unk> that <unk> these and <unk> ."
"and we &apos;ve started to make pieces , starting with <unk> , <unk> the <unk> to <unk> letters , to make these <unk> to make these <unk> back to <unk> them ."
"in each step , we created these pieces in <unk> so that we could <unk> them , because we were trying to create a very <unk> process in a minute ."
we tried to get to the point of <unk> .
"so , this looks like a <unk> ."
"if we get to those right big <unk> -- with 100,000 <unk> -- they &apos;re not just going to grow e. ; it <unk> all the possibility of modern <unk> , and we <unk> to others ."
"we knew from a <unk> of <unk> called <unk> , which is using biology to <unk> dna that can <unk> these pieces ."
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> <unk> of the three million degrees <unk> .
you can see in the upper field that your <unk> just falls apart .
"12 to 24 hours later , it &apos;s all <unk> again as it was ."
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
"these organisms can be completely <unk> , they can actually live in the <unk> ."
"i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in <unk> and can move , looking for <unk> conditions ."
"in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there ."
"here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by using these <unk> , actually , we &apos;ve used <unk> with the right design of the bits of design , we put them together , <unk> them together , and we put it together ."
this is not <unk> ; it &apos;s a <unk> statement .
it &apos;s such a huge molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
these are <unk> over six seconds .
that &apos;s the <unk> we &apos;ve just done recently .
these are over <unk> letters of code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure ever created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
"if we were to deal with a <unk> of 10 and without <unk> , it would be <unk> pages to try to <unk> these genetic code ."
"well , how do we start a <unk> ? how do we <unk> it ?"
"obviously , it &apos;s a virus , very simple . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria ."
"and it &apos;s as simple as if you &apos;re in <unk> as we &apos;re doing it , you just get out the nucleus and you put another in there , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the <unk> ."
"in <unk> , the <unk> is in the cell , but we &apos;ve just recently shown that you can make a whole <unk> of a cell <unk> from one cell to another ."
"we <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> , and we said , these two <unk> are <unk> like people and mice , and we gave a few <unk> to pick this one , and we <unk> it into <unk> , and we <unk> it as a <unk> cell ."
the new <unk> went to the cell .
"in fact , we thought that &apos;s the end here , but we &apos;ve tried to get the process out ."
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
"we find all sorts of species that have taken a second <unk> , or a <unk> of <unk> , every time , there &apos;s thousands of characteristics in just one second ."
so people who imagine evolution as a gene that is going to be <unk> much from biology .
there are <unk> called the <unk> that actually <unk> dna .
the <unk> that in the cell was not having ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve put it down .
"it was <unk> in the cell and realized the other <unk> as a <unk> material , and we had a cell at the end of a new <unk> ."
it <unk> blue because of the genes that we have in .
"and after a very short time , it had lost all the species of species and <unk> completely into a new species based on new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell ."
"all the proteins were <unk> to the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve done ."
"it may sound like <unk> <unk> , but we can change the <unk> , things quite dramatic ."
now i have an argument that this is not the <unk> -- which is based on <unk> billion years of evolution .
and i have a reason that we may be able to create a new form of <unk> <unk> in which there could be massive new <unk> based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to what we need .
we &apos;re <unk> to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context : i was born in <unk> .
"today , three people on the planet have existed for every year in <unk> , within 40 years it will be four ."
"we have problems with <unk> , with <unk> and <unk> water , medicine , <unk> to six billion people ."
it &apos;s a challenge to offer nine .
"we need over five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion <unk> of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million <unk> of <unk> a day ."
"if we think about biological <unk> or anything to replace it , it will be a huge challenge ."
"then , of course , there &apos;s this whole co2 from this material that <unk> into the atmosphere ."
"now , we have , from our discoveries from all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that the <unk> of the future ."
"the <unk> had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of this ."
"and we &apos;re in the first line here at the limits of the <unk> reality , and the one of our notion ."
we have now <unk> technologies from this fast <unk> to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a big robot that can create millions of chromosomes a day .
"now , if you &apos;re going to have these 20 million different genes , or making these <unk> to make <unk> <unk> , or drugs new <unk> , we can change a little bit more <unk> than the last 20 years ."
"and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> and so on ."
this is a shot of <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re working with to actually sit in and <unk> new species on computers .
"you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it is going to look like . we know what the genetic code is going to look like ."
we &apos;re now focusing on <unk> &apos;s fourth generation .
"they have seen corn <unk> recently , which is a bad experiment ."
"we have <unk> the <unk> and the third generation that are going to be relatively much more likely to have , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> ."
"but , as we think , the only way we think about biology is a huge impact with no other <unk> of the cost of <unk> or the <unk> of its availability , if we see co2 as a <unk> , and so we go to the cells ."
"and we think we &apos;re going to be the first <unk> of the fourth generation , about 18 months ."
sunlight and co2 is a way .
"but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of <unk> methods ."
this is an organism we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
"he lives in the <unk> , about <unk> miles deep , almost <unk> ."
it <unk> co2 from using hydrogen to use hydrogen as a source of energy .
"we &apos;re looking at whether we can use <unk> co2 , which could be put into <unk> , <unk> the co2 in the fuel , <unk> this process ."
within a short period of time we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
"you know , we have really <unk> goals , like the <unk> of the entire <unk> industry industry . right , if you couldn &apos;t do this at ted , where else ? one <unk> of the energy ."
"but in the same way , we &apos;re working on using the same <unk> for the development of <unk> ."
"you &apos;ve seen it this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year , and we &apos;ve got a dollar down to a little bit , if it goes to the right vaccine ."
i think that can be changed by <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
"this is how the future might look like to change , today &apos;s <unk> can be <unk> with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> ."
we &apos;re <unk> from getting people to improve . our goal is to be that we have a chance to survive for a long time to do that . thank you very much .
"at the last ted conference , i gave a <unk> to <unk> ."
and i promised to come back to explain how this machine works .
"so it &apos;s <unk> , and for those of you who are not there , the <unk> is the biggest scientific experiment that have ever <unk> in the <unk> ."
his task is to create the conditions that <unk> less than a <unk> second at the beginning of the universe -- and to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just <unk> <unk> .
this is the machine below <unk> .
we take pictures of these <unk> in <unk> .
"i &apos;m working on this one . he &apos;s called the <unk> -- 44 meters in the <unk> , 22 meters in the <unk> ."
here &apos;s a <unk> picture of the atlas of the <unk> so you see the <unk> .
"on <unk> september <unk> , the machine was the first time ."
and this image was taken from atlas .
it <unk> <unk> <unk> in the water .
"it &apos;s an image of the first <unk> that <unk> all the way around the <unk> , and then <unk> with a part of the <unk> , to make a rain from <unk> to the <unk> ."
"in other words , when we saw this picture on the <unk> september , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph ."
"i don &apos;t know if this is the largest <unk> <unk> , or this , when somebody went to the google side , and the <unk> was so <unk> ."
it means that we make a cultural impact next to scientific <unk> .
"about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these <unk> here -- these golden <unk> ."
these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine <unk> .
"well , the engineers are going to look at them and say , &quot; no they don &apos;t . these are little <unk> . &quot;"
"you can afford that because if you &apos;re very far away , you &apos;re going to be called the <unk> ."
"so , minus <unk> degrees , so , as the space between the stars , these <unk> can <unk> the tension ."
"in one of the connections , between <unk> magnet , there was a <unk> ."
it <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
"well , this is all <unk> when you imagine that the magnet <unk> over 20 tons and <unk> around about 30 <unk> ."
so we <unk> about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
"we <unk> them , <unk> them ."
they &apos;re all back to their path .
"by the end of march , the <unk> will be <unk> again ."
"we &apos;re going to <unk> it , and we &apos;re going to be able to collect the first data in june or <unk> , and <unk> our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are ."
"well , of course , in a kind of <unk> of such accidents , again , the debate about the value of science and <unk> in such borders . it &apos;s easy to <unk> ."
"i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our borders , we get the value of things like <unk> ."
"i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words to a english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who i suspect , when he was the <unk> of his <unk> , his <unk> , michael <unk> said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for our development of the <unk> ."
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
"<unk> books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that ."
"it &apos;s also my big , <unk> love and <unk> ."
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
"however , <unk> is something weird in my life and my career that &apos;s going to happen to <unk> my work with this work completely ."
"this <unk> event was that i wrote a book recently -- a <unk> named <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , love <unk> -- which decided that , unlike all of my <unk> books from <unk> in the world of <unk> and a great international <unk> ."
and the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as if i was the <unk> .
"seriously , the <unk> <unk> ."
"for example , they &apos;re going to worry about me , and they say , &quot; don &apos;t fear that you will never be <unk> ?"
"don &apos;t you fear your whole life , and you never create a book that <unk> in the world ? never <unk> ?"
"okay , so that really makes courage ."
it would be worse when i didn &apos;t remember that i was going to spend over 20 years ago when i first told the first time that i wanted to say that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of <unk> response .
"people said , do you don &apos;t have a fear , never succeed ?"
do you don &apos;t fear you <unk> the <unk> ?
did you don &apos;t fear that you &apos;re going to take your life out of your life and you &apos;re never going to die and you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> <unk> -- your mouth with the <unk> of failure ?
"so , you know , you know ."
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk> <unk> .
"yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things ."
and i had always .
and i have a lot more things about fear that no one would be about .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
"but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it , and i wonder , why ?"
is that <unk> ?
is it <unk> that it should be expected to do that it was scared to do the work that he feels .
and what &apos;s exactly about the creative <unk> that they make us <unk> about the <unk> <unk> -- in a way that there are other professions ?
"my father , for example , was chemists and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist when he was asked if he was afraid to be a chemist ."
"with your <unk> , john -- how about that ?"
"it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?"
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not given the <unk> of <unk> <unk> people .
"but we may seem to have this kind of <unk> , but not only the writers , but not only the creative <unk> , seem to have these <unk> , seem to be <unk> <unk> <unk> ."
"all you have to do is look at the <unk> of really great minds alone from the 20th century , who died young and often from their own hand ."
"and even the people who were not actually <unk> <unk> , seemed to be really <unk> ."
norman <unk> <unk> said shortly before his death in his last interview : every one of my books has killed me a little bit .
a <unk> statement you can do about your <unk> .
"but we don &apos;t even know when we hear something like this , because we know this kind of thing from a long time . somehow , we have the notion of <unk> and <unk> that creativity and so <unk> , of course , and <unk> art and <unk> ."
the question i &apos;d like to ask anybody today is : is this idea for you all right ?
do you feel like that ? because with just a <unk> distance -- i don &apos;t feel at this notion .
i find them <unk> .
"and i find them dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch her next century it &apos;s taken ."
i think it &apos;s better when we live our big creative <unk> .
"and i definitely know that it would be -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous in my situation to begin to <unk> this dark <unk> , especially in the way i &apos;m in my career ."
that &apos;s -- you see : i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have more 40 <unk> in me .
"and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from the world as the work that came out of the great success of my last book , right ?"
"i say it <unk> , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here , and it &apos;s very likely that my <unk> success is behind me ."
"oh , jesus , what a thought !"
"these are the kind of thoughts that you can get somebody to start <unk> , <unk> , and i don &apos;t want to ."
i would rather have this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
"after a while of the <unk> , i seem to be able to continue to write , a kind of <unk> of psychological design has to design ."
and somehow i have to find a way to write a certain distance between me and my very natural <unk> about how the reaction is going to be .
"while i was looking for models for this last year to do this , i &apos;ve also been searching for the past , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see how they might be creative or how they might have ideas about how to help creativity ."
this <unk> led me to the old <unk> and the old <unk> .
"please follow me , because the circle gets close ."
"but in the old <unk> and <unk> people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , ok ?"
"they believed that creativity had been a kind of <unk> that comes from a distant , <unk> source of people -- from <unk> , for example ."
the <unk> <unk> called the <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> .
it &apos;s known from <unk> that he believed that he had a <unk> <unk> to <unk> him from distant <unk> .
"the <unk> had the same idea , called this kind of creative creative mind , a <unk> <unk> ."
this is great . the <unk> did not really think that a <unk> was a particularly <unk> individual .
they believed that there was this kind of <unk> <unk> creature that believed that they were <unk> in the walls in the walls of a <unk> -- about as <unk> -- the <unk> -- the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artist <unk> <unk> .
this is brilliant -- because it &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the <unk> <unk> who protect you from your work .
"and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?"
"and the artist &apos;s <unk> was part of the <unk> of things , like , for example , <unk> , right ?"
"if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at anything for you , and everyone knew that you had this <unk> <unk> , that helped you ."
"if your work <unk> -- not entirely your mistakes , right ?"
everybody knew her <unk> was a <unk> .
so people in the west have really thought about creativity .
"and then the <unk> came , and everything changed , and we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- about every <unk> and <unk> , and there &apos;s no <unk> of <unk> ."
"it &apos;s the beginning of rational <unk> , and people started thinking that creativity came out of their own individual ."
"so for the first time in history , you hear these people or those artists call an artist -- instead of having a <unk> ."
"i have to tell you , i think it was a great mistake ."
"you know ? i think an naked person to allow you to think that he &apos;s like the <unk> , like the <unk> and the essence of all the <unk> and the source is a little creative , <unk> , <unk> is a little bit <unk> ."
it &apos;s like to ask you the sun .
the <unk> and <unk> <unk> all the <unk> and it creates all these <unk> expectations for success .
i think that this <unk> has <unk> our artists from the last 500 years .
"and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question ."
can we change it ?
maybe an <unk> understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
maybe not .
and maybe we can &apos;t <unk> the <unk> from 500 years from <unk> to a <unk> talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who would really <unk> scientific <unk> over the idea of the idea of -- basically <unk> -- people <unk> and <unk> on their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to <unk> is : why not ?
why not so much ?
because it &apos;s going to make sense of the same thing as much as i &apos;ve heard about when it went to explain the absolute <unk> of creative process .
"one process that -- like any one knows that it has ever done to make something -- in other words , in fact , everyone here -- doesn &apos;t matter ."
"in fact , he could sometimes <unk> <unk> ."
"i &apos;ve recently met such <unk> as i met american <unk> <unk> <unk> , who was now over 90 , but her whole life was <unk> for me , she told me that she was in the <unk> , and she was working on the <unk> ."
she said it would be like a <unk> train .
the country on her <unk> .
"she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under her feet ."
"and she knew that she could do just like this for a moment , and that was -- in her words -- <unk> like the devil ."
"they <unk> like the <unk> to the house while they were <unk> by this poem , and it was the only thing that they had to get fast enough to get a piece of paper and a pen so she had to <unk> through it and <unk> ."
"they didn &apos;t paint them fast enough . they <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but she didn &apos;t <unk> the house , and she <unk> through her and she <unk> her . she said she said she <unk> about land , and she said -- she said , &quot;"
and then there were those moments -- the part i &apos;m never going to forget -- she said that there were moments in which they were almost <unk> .
"so , she <unk> the house , and she <unk> looking for paper , and she goes through her , and she <unk> a pen with her <unk> and she said -- she said -- she was it as if she was able to bring it back to another ."
"she <unk> the poem on his <unk> , and she moved back to her body , and she took it on the paper ."
the poem came up with the poem was called <unk> and <unk> on paper -- but backwards from the first word .
"when i heard that , i thought it was <unk> -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is happening ."
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
"i &apos;m a <unk> . in order to work , i have to get up every day at the same time at the same time , <unk> me and really <unk> ."
"but in my <unk> , i sometimes have this thing ."
and i guess that many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that come from a source that i really can &apos;t identify .
what is this for one thing ?
"and how do we deal with that in relation to our minds without losing it , but to keep ourselves in the opposite health ?"
"and for me , the best living example of how you can do this with the <unk> tom <unk> , and i met him for some years ago ."
"we talked about this subject . and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodiment of <unk> of modern modern <unk> , trying to <unk> these creative <unk> that <unk> into him and with them ."
"but then he got older and <unk> . he told me that he was going to go on a <unk> in los angeles , and it changed everything ."
"and he drove up with high speed as he suddenly heard a little <unk> of a <unk> , which is a lot of <unk> in <unk> , and it &apos;s hard for him . and he wants to do it , but he can &apos;t <unk> it ."
"he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he has no pen , he &apos;s got no <unk> ."
"so he starts to <unk> this old <unk> in him like , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be <unk> from this song ."
"i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not <unk> it ."
"but instead of panic , he just stopped ."
he finished all the <unk> and did something completely new .
"he just put in the sky , and he said , <unk> excuse me , you can &apos;t see i drive car ?"
so i look at it as if i just <unk> a song ?
"if you really want to exist , come back to a <unk> moment when i can take care of you ."
"if you don &apos;t , <unk> somebody else today ."
go and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
his <unk> <unk> has changed after that .
"not the work itself , which was always as dark as <unk> and ever <unk> ."
"but the process and the hard <unk> that surrounds it was <unk> when it took out of the <unk> where he didn &apos;t take anything as a <unk> , and he <unk> it , and he realized that he had to be a <unk> ."
"it could give a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , <unk> thing that wasn &apos;t entirely tom ."
"when i heard this story , it changed a little bit of the way i was working and it has been saved ."
"this idea , when i was in the middle of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love was , i fell in one of the <unk> of the <unk> in which we all fall into something , and it won &apos;t be <unk> ."
"not only bad , but the <unk> of all times ."
i started thinking i should just <unk> this project .
"but then i remembered how tom was talking to the sky , and i tried to do it ."
"so i <unk> my view from the <unk> , and i talked about my <unk> in the direction of the room ."
"i spoke to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , you know , you know , and i don &apos;t know if this book is brilliant that it &apos;s not my fault , right ?"
"because you see that i have everything that i have , <unk> . i don &apos;t have any more than that ."
"so if you want to have it better , you &apos;ve got to <unk> here , and you have to deal with them ."
"okay . but , if you don &apos;t know -- you know what the <unk> with it ."
"i &apos;ll still write , because that &apos;s my job ."
and i want to give you a <unk> that i was here for my part of the jobs here .
"because ... at the end of the end , it &apos;s like <unk> . centuries ago , in centuries of <unk> people have been <unk> with <unk> <unk> and <unk> music that have been <unk> for hours -- to <unk> ."
"these <unk> were always great , because the <unk> were professional , and they were fantastic ."
"but again and , very rare , something happened special . one of the <unk> was actually <unk> ."
"and i know you know what i mean , because i know that you &apos;ve all seen in your life ."
"and it was when the time of <unk> and the <unk> were going through a kind of <unk> , and he did nothing different than he did before -- 1,000 <unk> before , but everything came together ."
"and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem to be in <unk> ."
"it was <unk> from inside , and down from the bottom , and everything <unk> through a <unk> fire ."
"when that happened then , people knew what that was , and they called it ."
"they put their hands together , and they started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god ."
"that &apos;s god , you know ?"
"interesting historic <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , they took these <unk> <unk> , the <unk> changed over the centuries of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> ."
"when an <unk> in spain has done something called <unk> , <unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , great <unk> , <unk> <unk> , there is a <unk> look at god ."
"and that &apos;s great , because we need it ."
"but , the <unk> part of the morning , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> up and <unk> , that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer <unk> a <unk> of god ."
"he &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and maybe he &apos;ll never go back to that <unk> ."
"and maybe somebody &apos;s never going to call <unk> , if he &apos;s <unk> , but what should he do with the rest of his life ?"
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the <unk> <unk> of a creative life .
"but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of <unk> if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning of you , the <unk> of your <unk> ."
if you just think that you &apos;re a <unk> -- from an <unk> source of a <unk> source for your lifetime that &apos;s passed to someone else when you &apos;re finished .
"when we start thinking about this , it changes everything ."
"so i started thinking , and i think i &apos;ve been working with security in the last months , while i was working on the book , which is soon as the dangerous , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of my <unk> <unk> ."
"what i have to tell myself is that when i get crazy about it , i &apos;m not afraid ."
no <unk> .
just make your job .
"it &apos;s still for your contribution to your contribution , whatever he is ."
"if your job is dance , dance ."
"when the stupid <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you to the page is to show you for a brief moment of wonder by your effort , <unk> <unk> <unk> !"
"and if you don &apos;t , dance your dance ."
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for all of us .
"i believe that and i have the feeling , we should teach ."
"<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for all of this , just for you , you know , you have the <unk> of love and the <unk> to be there ."
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
"last year , i showed these two slides to <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> for three million years , the <unk> of the lower 48 states has been <unk> to 40 percent ."
"but it doesn &apos;t <unk> much enough the <unk> of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the <unk> of the <unk> ."
"in some sense , the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> heart of our global health ."
they <unk> in winter and <unk> in summer .
the next slide i &apos;ll show you is a <unk> of what &apos;s happening in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is <unk> with red .
"as you see , it <unk> down the <unk> , and this is the <unk> ice in winter , and it <unk> in the summer ."
"the so-called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which <unk> out of the body ."
"in 25 years , it will be gone from here ."
"this is a problem , since warming <unk> the <unk> reason for the <unk> ocean , where there &apos;s huge amounts of <unk> carbon , which when it <unk> to <unk> microbes to <unk> ."
"compared to the entire amount of <unk> <unk> in the atmosphere , it could double that amount if we <unk> the critical point ."
"today , in fact , <unk> across a flat lakes in alaska <unk> from the water ."
professor <unk> walter in the university of alaska traveled to another <unk> sea with another flat lake last winter .
wow .
it &apos;s all right . the question is how is it <unk> us .
and one reason is this enormous <unk> <unk> from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> .
"if you want to know how the sea level goes through <unk> , you <unk> into the sea ."
these rivers are taking <unk> .
"at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest <unk> on the planet ."
last month <unk> that the entire continent now has a negative <unk> .
"and the <unk> , which is over a few <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> ."
"this is 20 foot <unk> , as <unk> ."
"in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see new lakes that were <unk> a few years ago ."
40 percent of all people in the world get half of their <unk> from this <unk> .
"in the <unk> , this <unk> is the <unk> for this city ."
the <unk> have <unk> .
"but if you &apos;re <unk> , it will <unk> most of the water ."
"in california , a 40 <unk> has been seen by the <unk> of sierra sierra <unk> ."
this is <unk> .
and the predictions of how you read them are seriously .
this <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> <unk> .
"and the <unk> all over the world have in a really <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;ve never ever been <unk> <unk> ."
"so many in the last 30 years , as in the <unk> <unk> ."
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
"if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it is ."
"in the last five years , we &apos;ve created 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans ."
"look at the area of eastern pacific <unk> , from the american continent <unk> and both of the indian <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of the ocean in the ocean ."
"the biggest factor for global warming , <unk> to global warming , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels ."
"oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest problem ."
"the united states is one of the largest <unk> , together with china ."
and the <unk> was to build many more <unk> .
but we start to see change .
here are the ones who have been <unk> over the past years were <unk> with some green alternatives that have been <unk> .
<unk> is there a political <unk> in our country .
"and the <unk> and the <unk> have spent an <unk> last <unk> to <unk> clean coal , which is already a contradiction in itself ."
this picture reminded me of something .
"for christmas , at home in <unk> , a billion tons of <unk> ."
you saw it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> <unk> america .
this happened for christmas .
one of the <unk> for christmas was this .
"<unk> &apos;s <unk> is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
"there &apos;s this <unk> and <unk> in america , and it helps to grow our economy ."
"<unk> , the <unk> will get clean every day ."
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in <unk> .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> roofs .
"so let me just tell you a very clear thing . al gore , nancy <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about ."
so the <unk> for two <unk> started to live .
"this is a , part of you ."
we see <unk> <unk> as a serious danger of our business .
"so that &apos;s why we put it to the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> to take a <unk> on the way to get the truth about coal ."
"in fact , coal is not dirty ."
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it <unk> too well .
"so , don &apos;t worry about <unk> ."
let &apos;s give you a <unk> .
"<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it ."
"so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean <unk> ."
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean <unk> .
"and yet the burn of coal is one of the global warming for global warming , which is remarkable clean , which you see here , changes everything ."
"so look at it exactly , this is where today &apos;s clean <unk> ."
"finally , the positive alternative to our economic challenge , and our challenge of national security ."
"america is in a crisis , the economy , the <unk> security , the economy ."
the red <unk> that connects all of them is our <unk> from <unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk> oil .
"but now there is a <unk> , new solution to <unk> us from that <unk> ."
"<unk> america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years ."
"a plan to bring america back to work , to make ourselves safer and help to stop global warming ."
"finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems ."
<unk> america . find more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
"one of the fastest ways of <unk> our <unk> , <unk> <unk> that <unk> our world ."
"the future is here . wind , sun and a new <unk> ."
new investments to create well <unk> jobs .
<unk> america is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
"there &apos;s an old <unk> <unk> : &quot; if you want to be fast , please ."
"if you want to come far , go together . &quot;"
"we need to come far , and it &apos;s fast ."
thank you .
so i want to start by asking you to come to the time of your childhood as they were playing with <unk> .
"as they realized , as you <unk> the hands of the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> and , they actually learned to <unk> and to understand the problems and <unk> through the understanding ."
the <unk> thinking is <unk> to how we understand a lot of our environment .
"as a <unk> -- inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> , i started to wonder : what if we could use computers , instead , what would we use on a <unk> , like a map , like a digital <unk> , as well as a"
this question was so <unk> that we decided that we decided to study exploration and <unk> developed .
"in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> ."
"you can move with your hand , you can see each other , you can detect your movements , and you have a <unk> and a <unk> ."
"much more importantly , which is physically , so you can only move it through the hands of the hands and access ."
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation from back to the digital data .
"and when these tools become <unk> , and the awareness of their movements develop , each other , and the <unk> of what we actually see with them , then we can start to see with <unk> new and <unk> ."
i start with some simple examples .
"this <unk> is <unk> for the <unk> , and when i move it into a direction , the video is going forward , when i move it into the other direction , it goes backwards ."
and these interactive portraits take each other .
"so if i put them on top of it , you get your interest ."
"if you &apos;re <unk> around you , you &apos;ll notice that , and you can get something nervous ."
and they &apos;re also <unk> their movements and <unk> .
"an interesting consequence of the <unk> that we started to see was that we could use everyday gestures on data , how about colors , how to do this with <unk> ."
"in this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> , and i can use it to <unk> color in the middle , where they &apos;re <unk> ."
"when we <unk> it , we can <unk> a little bit ."
"there &apos;s also a couple of nice possibilities in education like languages , math or <unk> , where we &apos;re going to give people the possibility of fast <unk> and the results immediately ."
here i am -- this is a <unk> i <unk> with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with <unk> that &apos;s kind of a mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
"basically , you get every round of <unk> on every round of <unk> letters , and as you try to make words , these are <unk> ."
"and then after about 30 seconds , you get <unk> and you have a new <unk> and new opportunities ."
thank you .
"these are some of the kids who came to the <unk> lab , and i could move them , and i took a video of it ."
they really <unk> it .
a more interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
"all you have to say is &quot; words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do ."
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our <unk> <unk> at the right .
it turns out he wanted to <unk> <unk> .
so they were just <unk> for him .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
"he can bring new characters in the scene by <unk> the <unk> of the table , that character ."
here he <unk> the sun .
the sun goes .
now he <unk> a <unk> in the scene .
the <unk> <unk> .
good work ! yeah !
"by putting the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and by putting them together , he can interact the characters ..."
... his own story <unk> .
<unk> !
it &apos;s a story of <unk> and it can decide how it evolved .
<unk> cat .
"the last example , for which i &apos;ve got time to show you is a <unk> for <unk> , which we &apos;ve recently developed and <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> and <unk> ."
each has four different <unk> ; you can pick what you want to use .
and you can <unk> those <unk> into the sequence that you can <unk> in any pattern .
and you <unk> them by just holding a <unk> .
"there are effects that can change live , like <unk> and <unk> ."
"and you connect it with a particular tone , and it <unk> it ."
and then even more <unk> effects like speed and <unk> that you use on the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
"we start , in which we <unk> the <unk> into two <unk> and <unk> them into a series , they expand a little more of the voice ."
now i &apos;m going to add a <unk> .
now i &apos;m going to do something else .
and now i connect the filters with the <unk> so that i can control the effect .
i can <unk> the whole sequence by <unk> at one direction or another .
and now i &apos;m <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> ; for more expression .
i can <unk> the sequence as you .
"so i don &apos;t have to plan it in <unk> , but it can <unk> or <unk> it ."
"and <unk> , i can <unk> the whole sequence by the <unk> ."
thank you .
"so , as you can see , my <unk> is to develop new <unk> that fit better on how our brains and bodies work ."
"and i &apos;ve had time to show you a part of this new <unk> , and some of the possibilities that we work in our lab ."
"the idea that i want to leave you with the path is that we &apos;re on the threshold of this new generation of <unk> to the interaction with digital media , the information in our world , our <unk> ."
thank you .
and i &apos;m <unk> to the conversations with you .
"yes , good day ."
i &apos;m excited to be here .
"yes , what should be <unk> ?"
"i &apos;ve got to do a little bit of a <unk> , and just <unk> with the modern <unk> ."
"i <unk> <unk> and i &apos;ve been working with a couple of years of <unk> , and i started to know that , because i just wanted to know , and i just wanted to do it in all the way that i &apos;ve learned in <unk> ."
so that was my <unk> motivation .
"so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter , like that ."
"i think the <unk> in general now is now talking about biotechnology , biotechnology , everything that &apos;s about , <unk> biology and so on ."
"extremely important , now is extremely important and much more important , much more important will be in the future ."
there &apos;s so <unk> things like all these <unk> that have been <unk> to plants .
"now there &apos;s now craig venter in the <unk> , trying to make <unk> , so <unk> from algae ."
"and there &apos;s also things that are totally <unk> in the daily life , which most people are not aware of , for example , <unk> that allow us to <unk> at <unk> degrees , are also <unk> <unk> ."
and the list can continue to continue .
"and so from the interest in this technology , this technology , i &apos;ve just been on the <unk> ."
so what &apos;s why <unk> ?
most people know most people know this from the <unk> .
"computers <unk> , and then it &apos;s always <unk> into the media , and it &apos;s going to break it somewhere , and it will break it somewhere , and so on ."
"it &apos;s kind of sad for the <unk> very sad , because it doesn &apos;t even hits what it actually actually has started , and what &apos;s actually on behind it ."
"and in fact , the <unk> , in the <unk> , were starting with <unk> and made out of the internet ."
"and it &apos;s about <unk> , creative , creative , <unk> , to solve a problem ."
"and the problem , which is not just a technical problem , it can also be a <unk> problem , it can be just a <unk> , just like doing things , a choice , a question of <unk> , or how to make it differently ."
"and it &apos;s just been <unk> with software , but there &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole <unk> that can do with <unk> all kinds of things ."
"and now even in the direction of biology , and because i want to take this metaphor that &apos;s <unk> from synthetic biology , is actually a <unk> code , because the <unk> code is a three-dimensional , as it &apos;s not , right , it &apos;s not the same ."
"but it &apos;s also a code , and you can <unk> it , and you can also <unk> it , as well as i found it , and i found it <unk> , and i just wanted to do a lot deeper with <unk> ."
"it &apos;s actually only <unk> eight times , <unk> that these networks ."
"there are <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india , <unk> network , but has now active people around the world ."
"these are a more artistic <unk> , so that &apos;s a lot of artists , and <unk> and <unk> , with scientists , have been <unk> with these technologies and asking questions and questions , and there are all kinds of <unk> , and there &apos;s <unk> ."
but it &apos;s actually always about trying to find such an <unk> access to having a <unk> <unk> so that it is .
"and then there are <unk> <unk> , <unk> ."
"this is from the <unk> of a network , which is actually more like the kind of forum , where you take care of , and <unk> ."
"these are a little bit of technical and also a bit of <unk> on the outside , and then they &apos;re also going to ask <unk> questions ."
"and this <unk> of these <unk> that made the whole <unk> , has <unk> a scene like that , which i just want to take a <unk> ."
"you see here in the upper left here , you see this is a <unk> , so basically a kind of school , such as a private school , <unk> , where everyone can get to ."
"kids , old , all kinds of people go there , just to <unk> around , they put a lab , and look at what you can do when you put these <unk> ."
"and there &apos;s a group down here in indonesia , <unk> , which is that there are quite a long time ."
already longer than these two networks .
"they also <unk> in such a artistic aspect of <unk> materials and , well , <unk> , and combine that in a pretty <unk> way ."
"so a group of <unk> that i &apos;ve <unk> a while ago , that &apos;s a <unk> that wants to <unk> the public to try to learn what they did in college , and they &apos;ve tried to <unk> on a little bit of <unk> and so little <unk> ."
and i have on top of the other image a lecture in <unk> in the medical museum in the medical museum with a <unk> .
"and that is , yes , that &apos;s mostly young people , but the only thing that one <unk> all of us in fact is that this is <unk> of technology ."
"and what do you can do with that , and you can also <unk> the society and ask you to ask and ask , so , okay , what do you know what your <unk> do , you &apos;ve got your interest in your interest ?"
"so , <unk> , to <unk> biology , you somehow need material ."
"you need biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory ."
"<unk> , what you usually understand under a lab , that &apos;s kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely expensive , <unk> , just for <unk> academics with <unk> and so on ."
"and our approach was just to say , <unk> that actually you don &apos;t have to do that ."
"that &apos;s actually not necessarily because each of any <unk> has actually evolved higher technology than most <unk> , that &apos;s really ."
"and o <unk> with this <unk> , for example , has tried brian <unk> in england , a <unk> <unk> , has taken a <unk> , a <unk> and a <unk> , so <unk> and <unk> , and then <unk> bacteria ."
"so , every one that has been a soup that has been left for a long time , even before ."
"i tried that in my lab , a little bit of <unk> , and then i bought myself so <unk> on ebay and made a little <unk> analysis to try to make a <unk> , so <unk> , at home ."
"now , this should not be a joke , but ."
"there &apos;s in the picture here , you see the lab , in <unk> , so it &apos;s such a <unk> garage , with all kinds of <unk> that <unk> in paris , has a group in paris that &apos;s pretty much has to do it ."
"and this one is <unk> , who also mentioned <unk> , this kind of <unk> in the principle of biology ."
"and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s a number of people who do at home , until too big , far , the better organizations , which is doing more <unk> in <unk> form ."
but always the approach that it is simply that it should just be available and accessible .
"so the first project that we &apos;ve done as international group , as we basically became aware of our own , <unk> , we &apos;re here as real , and we &apos;re online online , and we &apos;re familiar with people , and we &apos;re so on ."
"and then we came from the <unk> <unk> , the founder of <unk> , and said <unk> , we have to actually meet real , also in real <unk> , and then <unk> two <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> and a half in london ."
"and there &apos;s also about that , yes , we &apos;re <unk> who are , what do we want , what do we want to tell ?"
"and what are our values and what are our <unk> , our foundation ?"
and then we did a <unk> <unk> .
"so that was quite intuitive , so everyone has just got your desires and what &apos;s going on , say , &quot; well . &quot;"
and i think there was a great code of good code .
"and then we have this not <unk> , but that &apos;s , i think , you know , i think , quite well , people are quite <unk> ."
"and in fact , we &apos;ve actually tried to <unk> that into the <unk> world , but it &apos;s kind of not that <unk> ."
"so i think we &apos;re from the <unk> , in terms of the world , even step further than the <unk> world ."
"yes , what we &apos;re doing now ?"
a project that i &apos;ve done with the <unk> in switzerland was that we wanted a so-called <unk> event or <unk> <unk> .
"so this is , when you &apos;re focusing on a room , in a room , you can <unk> these little particles in the air , or in the liquid and then move into this focus , which is , so there is a <unk> like a <unk> ."
"this really works , this is done in academic <unk> , and we have thought , <unk> , we may have <unk> , then we &apos;ve taken a <unk> , the <unk> , the lens <unk> , <unk> , you have a microscope ."
you can see it down there .
"and then we <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> the laser <unk> , and then we tried to focus on this camera ."
"and unfortunately , it doesn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it ."
"so another project that came out from the french group that worked out from paris , that &apos;s pretty cool ."
"and that &apos;s what he did , you know , that kind of a <unk> , so <unk> , or something like that , so he <unk> with <unk> , his <unk> is <unk> ."
"he then <unk> this helmet with this helmet , and in cooperation with the museum ."
"there were the <unk> in the room , <unk> up to this chair , <unk> into this helmet ."
"then they were measured by <unk> , and depending on what they thought or how they thought they were different lights in the room ."
was a pretty <unk> project .
"another thing that has to do with the united states that also has to do with this <unk> , is the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> complicated , complicated word ."
"so it &apos;s about <unk> genes , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , so you can see them ."
"so now , if i do this , the <unk> , the <unk> , go up , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then they do this method , and then they say , <unk> , <unk> , this hair ."
"and the machines that do something like this , which are pretty expensive to buy the commercial that are going to <unk> the <unk> ."
"and that &apos;s not <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do much ."
so that &apos;s just one application of many that you can do with it .
"and they have so two <unk> <unk> and said , &quot; well , we do make easier and cheaper , and then <unk> out of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , that this device , and they &apos;ve actually <unk> this device , and the <unk> ."
i think somehow <unk> dollars or something like that .
"but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s in any case where it &apos;s clearly <unk> ."
so i think it &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> .
a project that i started to build was a <unk> project .
"<unk> is , yes , like a kind of <unk> that <unk> about so far , two inches or like that ."
"you <unk> <unk> <unk> and then the <unk> <unk> into those <unk> , and then then i took the <unk> and then <unk> them for the <unk> ."
"so , the device you see there , it doesn &apos;t work ."
"but this is so my <unk> , but it &apos;s kind of <unk> , but it &apos;s kind of <unk> looked at this kind of <unk> , the thing on the <unk> , and it was <unk> , and that was the pressure was broken ."
and then i took a <unk> and put it on it .
"one <unk> , if you have the full power of water , the pressure has enough pressure , so i think <unk> enough to <unk> bar ."
and then you can <unk> the particles strong enough and then go into the <unk> .
"and the commercial device is about <unk> <unk> , or something like this , <unk> <unk> ."
"so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically <unk> ."
"and so that &apos;s just at the moment that the <unk> of the scene are <unk> , that availability of technology , and also <unk> the information , and <unk> the information , that more people can get involved ."
"because , as i started to say , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little bit of it , and also not a chance to make it really well ."
"because when you just read it from <unk> , it &apos;s not the same as if you saw it or saw it ."
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
"and if you can make choices as citizens as a community of choice in society , you want to be able to meet and drive , you need access to knowledge and technology ."
and you also have to do it and understand how to do it and understand it .
and the <unk> then <unk> under the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
"so that you <unk> as citizens , as you become <unk> with these scientific technologies ."
and this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
"these are the people who have at least officially <unk> on <unk> , <unk> <unk> ."
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also represented in <unk> .
"that &apos;s me , you know , there are less people <unk> than actually exist ."
so i know from some who don &apos;t have <unk> .
"and these are just the <unk> , the individual people ."
"and in part of this <unk> , so these places <unk> up there ."
and that &apos;s the very beginning .
