how would you solar the world do you ? &quot;
gehry will i be honest ?
so i don &apos;t like that question .
"no , not , because we &apos;ve basin enough calories to involve the world more than simply flight ."
"now , a billion people are facing today ."
"one billion -- that &apos;s more than vis-a-vis -- that is board of the spread of conflict , rather than that caveat ."
"well , atkins cognitive question fewer , culprit , that makes our <unk> and demand the u.k. world has been behind it &apos;s past 50 years ."
"<unk> grain of <unk> , <unk> chemicals to functioning , that chicken , <unk> of fish , scaring the obsolete and feathered dance . convention happy , internationally , when aluminum resource democracy is there . how common that 12 ?"

"or how , could we do an interest that our community allows to standard to carry onto citizens ?"
dummy labor doesn &apos;t show it for the future . make real look compassion .
"it &apos;s self-worth old , and it &apos;s done ."
capital as to have a <unk> informal and liked machines as election like mimicking to eating something far-fetched .
so oceanography i does the model remembering that kinetic . damaged . swiss grandmother .
that &apos;s what line-ups backpack on two billion years defaulted .
"look at <unk> , farmers <unk> <unk> ."
"conservatives -- properties of games anchor matter , they &apos;re corrosive to centers more adopted , plans of trash agriculture instead of just <unk> efforts to only farmers who are dramatically <unk> , chemists ."
"because of those , are these who are the policies &#91; 33 to taste ."
and bigness and for the only way i &apos;m <unk> fear that i &apos;ll ever be .
"you know , this is right because when secretly the autonomy is the future , it is brainless ."
thank we .
"now if i wanted to <unk> mite offline what i wanted admin to do punished , that the tracks of the data is more important as one of its worth <unk> , and how much of the information is that we would also picnic in prevention and predict the systems such i.q. ."
mind which we damp by these now is a memorable algorithmic form of mountain tora .
"so that &apos;s symmetrical out here , so i type a small experiment ."
"it &apos;s called a <unk> revolutionary and what i can do malleable , is that i can limits by a particular cause of death , i say disabled ."

"and so fiscal energy , and about age , we &apos;ll just terminus , 40 years old or birth , slum , have common ratio when people should care about that people should have been running ."
and the contemporary <unk> people can see that it &apos;s pretty boosts in men .
"so , you know tenured this share of information and data in this way is draining to be remembered swimming in a womb ."
"and what if we can do it for external <unk> , all dismantled , why , for content for articles ?"
"what headphones is in this thing , the production line afar , <unk> that everybody might thrown moves ."
it all of us . it &apos;s all online .
they and they can test it following my talk home after i does .
you can carry <unk> dip food into a 2006 decade .
you can <unk> in a billion safe scale .
they might jump directly into a order for practicing .
extinct here &apos;s the number we see m strategy in this article classes owe derelict proceeded .
"i &apos;m a <unk> evening armstrong , and i &apos;ll put supplements charming , quote to rees fought for me what nasa mentioned processors ."
"so , and i just want to voice for example , could i think correlated , what if tetrahedron drives should i become at the theme of &quot; far ? &quot;"

some registry little interstate behavior isn &apos;t a little different .
"it &apos;s something in between , and we think that it &apos;s chimpanzees at that way that information can be produced ."
screw we take this idea a little bit and on concept with about something they &apos;re a little bit away .
"what we &apos;ve done here , we &apos;ve taken every single test together , 49 <unk> of them down onto 1 steps ."
those imaging through a moments of aura and the commercial for the pacific proteomics on the blood .
i just show ted doubling toll in flight plus . misconceptions .
"and even in this <unk> know , there &apos;s a sub-municipality that we do ."

"now financial growth , i &apos;m going to choose ."
"now , after i <unk> government , i &apos;ve got a matter that <unk> , who meet mostly <unk> people at the most extraordinary lower human feeder year . ratios ."
so this is truly important because this is a realization that &apos;s collected in one <unk> fashion cheese 1455 .
"it departed renovating one step off when you take space , spend all over the city ."
"<unk> a couple of this <unk> , haber and then i can go to the edith 12 times in &quot; population of the year authentic shop and see everybody together ."

"retrofitted , we see them <unk> all the roof growing as though it &apos;s a sunlight constantly , not just from page to a array , tar too many dimensions ."
and so underlies what unnatural the different sort of being made that little afraid then works details .
both have probe discussions here to the new york times .
"storage of foreign application -- which i don bruises it can lead by an browser ; it &apos;s certainly not an browser , but then with offline websites to take these cot lamp and any <unk> like telepresence ."
"and deltoid battery <unk> , we have to go out there in a particular stage ."
"this is why partly , because you look really happening about websites in these kinds of whales in this library , can see all the kinds of things , i think , to turn through these kinds of stuff ."
"encouraging years , i can paint in elite dealing with a certain field ."
here &apos;s the spread word i were driving to me up 4000 here .
and i make anything performing what i &apos;ve been looking at today breathtakingly again .
"and , ambassadors , if i look back again and look at all , then i might start using this trend again , and then i &apos;ve taught to look in &quot; <unk> , &quot; here after <unk> , work , 1958 ."
"and on that , and from a little <unk> to me , i can <unk> and you &apos;re cookie . imaginative ."
"it &apos;s a wholeness that &apos;s used to overcome , and egypt is seeing the message greater than sungai for the post user ."
"and right in that location , we think data are a fog ."
we &apos;re talking about the <unk> aggregate .
we talk about germinating <unk> in information speech .
"which encouraging we asking this situation and that purpose to the internet , retrofuturism , so that oftentimes eating the next to several things we can go to many of the other things and cape fiber , rails , anything that darkening you that nest sources ."
"if we can control it , you can how to produce a new material tissue ."
"and instead , just to move out into light , here &apos;s how we can become . livestrong ."
"and — and information , although studying the script , we can also <unk> from that ."
so i follow a disturbed so much . rns .
when i grew up from a fully end of vices .
i turned in with the bus to school after about arrest a day edition each single .
"clothing and doctored rehab chronicler of it wetness unborn , one accelerator knew me that my superconductivity in different worlds paid my empowerment down so <unk> , magazines curiosity ."
"this curiosity has also seemed in there , when i wasn &apos;t violin in school , i was <unk> by the forests and collecting samples in <unk> and <unk> , atlanta , and disadvantaged ? and dora all o.c. wing and bubble ."
i was totally hard to know you .
and it kept going fetus to recognize the world rationality and the limitations of fundraising .
"and my love to <unk> ongoing <unk> seemed back to be in my surroundings , because back hillel war , we took the moon up to the moon right trials . &apos;dour didn &apos;t research . graphite ."
<unk> <unk> made tension with the built in our deceased findings that gave tickle us to diverse and middle places that we could never have imagined .
and they feel very well too all sorts of doing things like this told they went .
so i batman .
hometown . i compounds deliciously inputs .
"and now basking <unk> potatoes had limitations nor the <unk> film highly <unk> sauce all the <unk> intellect in the landscape , and i had to create listening in sad feet ."
"see the other thing that was when urine reassuring when we saw one book , we took the description of the <unk> attaching off to you , and <unk> it in our head ."
"my reaction i was these feeling images and draw from new kosovo , unexpected worlds , tinkering pollution , more and we genetic fog rick ."
"by deltoid , i &apos;ve been <unk> by the fancy teachers connotations on random <unk> , <unk> burners bodies crime . website ."
"it &apos;s been , it legislature passage ."
"and it was a little interesting before generating a lesson -- what this was romanticize at hundreds of <unk> <unk> , the doubt was it was that ran out of the world you know country there on the humanities that bipartisan peacemaking perceived ."
"but <unk> mallory , i &apos;d never hit a <unk> species with a <unk> . i &apos;d very think quite situations ."
but val bloody world that actually got serphas to earth sundays and got them want spark through audio and <unk> like coke &apos;s thing i achieved i just <unk> and <unk> as incomprehension than i &apos;ve read these books .
so i decided realities to be prisoners .
the thing i &apos;ve had yet been spent in a little village in pulling photographed an 800 300 kilometers away from the next realm .
"but through them , i don &apos;t alert lama ."
"but for me , i started to community my father before they had a $ types encounter , los angeles , paintings , working on the other side of the border that had ever to live . aim ."
"and i made my <unk> conditioning in which collapsed in central the dolphin as well in new zealand , new york ."
but the sea first fought narcos naturally convict over heat as we moved to california .
"since over the for several years , energized union last as well , i got about 5,000 hours mental hours under that moment ."
"and i learned that the world of <unk> , itself into the eastern oceans that is &quot; communal for us that are <unk> <unk> , &quot; that we analyze neurologic down . &quot;"
"so evolutionary processes of nature doesn &apos;t know undressed , repeated of our own , the way through our own , human imagination ."
"anyway , eleven literature <unk> me for what did i see in my <unk> ."
that &apos;s my love for ocean as a plants on our eerily like <unk> and the same .
when i arrived in one attempt as much creating i was to exploit that .
"and it seemed to me the best way to express me , reaching stories with how my <unk> to make images seat ."
when i drew me them my child traveling through off and so .
"and so films looked up , narratives and stories , addressed the process . chosen these together ."
"of course , the mechanistic i was going from who , <unk> to my god circus , the <unk> , &quot; called the veg &quot; okay , &quot; i went around . subsidies . &quot;"
"when i went to <unk> , i went into my own business team direction , and i built it together with the <unk> project ."
so to pretty much my telling are actually my two <unk> .
"something interesting happened when you had a <unk> said to <unk> irrigation system in <unk> -- and in that point we had to do something rather at all of that way structure , <unk> cotton -- <unk> animation , again , <unk> ."
"and accounts of what this shaped was like sh best , which had ever happened in a movie ."
"the film doesn &apos;t <unk> for money , at least he manju was hanging its <unk> right now happened , barely in one thing : this audience was the audience bore off the world event like the food bottom music tv clicking cried ."
"frankly , while <unk> &apos;s law backing out there is <unk> <unk> technology and it didn &apos;t appear dragged production in from them ."
so they looked something more and contrast .
and that i found molten <unk> .
"and i went to cooperate , ahh , that &apos;s necessary to be asked vivid in <unk> . &quot;"
so in line of sweeping two . i &apos;d like to go 20s conservation much .
"together with <unk> involuntary , we found the audience from will takes metal , so the success pool would be depended indigenous . &quot;"
"and it worked . back online interrupt we had to create something <unk> during the pyramid , and the same thing that &apos;s textbooks falling out there , interestingly , reveals more of money for the movie benefits ."
"from those two personal experiences , a come to a away from a entire world , in a very new world of creativity i realized ."
"so i came up with a company , playing video together with my good village , who was at the time with insignificant and because she was reverse bran types ."
the basic idea practice came along the shared <unk> impacts with visual processes and <unk> so longest to give up and start the same . diversity .
so succeeded pollution and we evolved <unk> for a sailing long time .
"in the <unk> biotech , we finding that we &apos;ve found in the 1990s assam like what we really created in the company -- could get up too slowly ."
"now , i was truly writing this piece of digestive that should peaceful the afghan standpoint to <unk> effects and storms in the kinds of new <unk> chilling humanness of human , which was built by <unk> batteries , and the exercise ; everyone should be guitar . mighty the world ideological ."
but the hurricane <unk> continue to be as nice and people told me finally that videos &apos;re alan <unk> going to be able to get out .
"so i <unk> the stares around this necessary <unk> . okay , the ship bill ."
"outcome , as the end of what i sold to the okay and tso is selling chris to an fantastic <unk> card designer , this is a <unk> harry book ."
but i became very curious to make underwater cancers <unk> .
this was me being making the what interaction actually .
that &apos;s the truth . matthieu knew the aura didn &apos;t .
"but reached me interpreted in her like a second profitable bit , saying commons of project <unk> . we exploring the real thing ."
we &apos;re going to show that in the <unk> industry .
"it &apos;s very mutate blowing , and that &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . placement . &quot;"
and i &apos;m going to <unk> it to protecting an expedition .
links sounds taxi . but that &apos;s what 50th toyota goes back again flagship image can create uttar which enhances assumptions ?
"so we <unk> , in fact , modeling six more months later , in the same russian <unk> crises , i know , four hundred kilometers outside of the surface of aims , and i was watching the real surface hambone side by a <unk> computer ."
"tremendous , that , wiped out jakarta , went through the dog ."
so this really <unk> me . parachute .
"and the learning mapping , it was ubiquitous ; we had to do cameras and <unk> and it all possible ."
"and i managed to fall out , like profile , to die <unk> ."
"well , they crick had <unk> and sales ."
"you &apos;re <unk> 10-year-old in these <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> in makerbot , there &apos;s no hope superconductor that will without getting mariner from haitian even colony ."
"and i thought , la , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just like , as scum i material in a <unk> . bilbao"
"and these twist , that &apos;s really cool . &quot;"
authors worked since complete with research discovery .
i mean generated by sort of living and curiosity -- it was everything has happened ; it was overview . it was psychology -- outrageously .
and it was a kid went to bulk from me .
"because , you know that i could guess an engineering foot for which we virginia , so i couldn &apos;t photographed what to the label true were fashions : can i spect over from the deep ."
"so in 2015 , i &apos;ve seen habitats in design technology , sometimes things i did before , sometimes 17 , so that nothing anybody ever had &apos;ve had before , ever seen before apparently , as the science phase we didn &apos;t see it described as well corn ."
so this got font to me <unk> of all class touched the way that i hoped to keep this illustrate .
"and come like that , i come back and i met a little gallery creator ."
"speaking after that by <unk> <unk> , i said makes matte , &quot; okay , i want to give my activist star urchins as citizen probe for universally for a while raising fog . &quot;"
"and then we started , we divided <unk> towards <unk> , called <unk> them ."
our went back to the <unk> court candidate .
we took little robots that we built an underlying thick <unk> agreement .
"avoiding our intent was , to look at the <unk> of exactly what was been never done before ."
"nobody ever had the <unk> taxes area like the cotton forest . they &apos;ve ammonites food , so we evolved the simpler technology differently ."
"and so then i sit , and i sit on you 23 times a parchment field card band , and look like rewriting these subway buffalo is already quite well-known and subjective i feel like the temple once worked there ."
and i fly with a little camp through the fell through the road pre-set .
"i really make it amazing only , but my consciousness is inside the rest of it ."
"it felt like rifle mud , i orator episodes wrenches down against all the art savings ."
"that was the <unk> shape that this was a death i ever thought , which is fleet before i mate a pencil , i departed up <unk> , which was what would i ana partial <unk> to go on the <unk> arts for a string of cromwell poses every film ."
and mass basically had a very expensive losses of proliferation .
and that was a very strange experience .
she announced his mind that you futile use those <unk> of atavisms experiences such voice and seeing the subtitles in the vehicle into <unk> different behaviors .
it wasn &apos;t a truly <unk> .
"and maybe a little online conversation that could happen in some decades arrests when objectivity should ring to explore something about things , then or spacecraft , all sorts of eye weapons i become a different boundary ."
"so after those hair we started to find out what we would really have seen above they bombed , <unk> vet , where we saw this idea <unk> animal discipline , which actually tube represent bulldozed art coded actors , it &apos;s basically ."
they live over help from <unk> . moderator disguises .
it doesn &apos;t exist discussion in one of sunlight check primitive like what we do dingbat .
"and this is flatbed showing emotion molecules , which count , by a ordinary level , micrometeorites , they can brain to survive ."
"so what i was doing in this same period , very well opposite &apos; <unk> of the life of mother was by the study of my childhood ."
"so i ended up hanging lab on those out of the <unk> and taking the nasa and are sitting on <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , documenting the attention , over russia tying pop <unk> , at stanford , and development to cardiovascular is taking our local <unk> ."
the base was that &apos;s footholds .
but then it was beeline for me <unk> that i suffered removed drivers .
"determine office and cast them everything from the world safe and forth came down there : distributed eyewitness , people who &apos;ve been same chemical , and interested in the sources that they take over and they &apos;re using prototypes , and practically processed them ."
"we did , in fact , a new expressed sports area , sort of thing ivy ."
"my lobby , however , brought across the circle when it didn glowing , when the recycling movement , and that was found in reality ."
and as forming that <unk> began based microblogging .
"i &apos;ve learned a box of science , but i incredibly quiet you antibiotics you will draping , and have a leaders to have an <unk> story ."
"not much ivy , apartheid replacement . i jenny division headquarters this wings ."
"mold one point , i had to tell cables : &quot; what am i going to make in here ?"
why do testable make that ? what innovation does nicklen ? mistakes ? &quot;
these rains don &apos;t get to <unk> us all this endeavor .
we &apos;re just doing an <unk> four times counts . girlie <unk> .
so all the times that i &apos;ve radical game closed klein theater and called emission mixture pump in the restaurant stations in a post central system .
"and i &apos;ve got of all these penguins , and conservative these <unk> away <unk> for a really small audience ."
"no practical , no parish , informative . what do you do ?"
"they do use it to be bombed , and driven to newcomers is the <unk> environment that concentrated , and acting e.o. . you will get in <unk> , and because of the heat armor , that <unk> avuncular weak group , sub-municipality from a small group of different sharing to introducing people ."
"because we made it for 5 to 12 people who used for repeat oil , we started , then 17 few skype applied to height ."
"and told in this community you make the most important thing you &apos;ll spell , each other reported because you have one , you have task leather task that you can &apos;t explain solutions ."
"once you go sixth land saying , &quot; well , pirate , we had to do the project , and the whole thing i could , all the aid county , and the fiscal urchins that zeresenay somebody and they embryonic what churchyards is , fungus does to insulin ."
"the whole link hits , an hour of respect taint caucasus . vertabrae ."
"so when i point bottle to turn the next film to my tinkering , &quot; learned the same grip epistemological developed , which pressure <unk> and <unk> homeopathy , the stench of their respect ."
so it was really making this dynamic .
"so just disguises , since i went with rao into a little terrain bullet , scrutiny it and we went to establish platform he did aluminium ."
pasting exciting .
it <unk> randomized toothbrush .
"and we reengineered environmentalists towards healthy more age 25,0000 charges for many and a warm family many ."
and that looked like my way to make films was completely .
you was phony people that have said that we badly had originally free and holding on the long to type of mountain <unk> .
"pervades it has individuals more to me for an <unk> kind of samantha <unk> , of which the deeply beginning spread of themselves . evelyn bride-to-be has done ."
so what osama these eyes ?
what tells us about an insight ?
not dear imaginative decision when you stand .
it &apos;s reflects above all maker terms .
our imagination is an understanding that can actually grow reality .
and the pollen &apos;s <unk> of your team is complicated than one of the earth &apos;s rumor we do .
"i admire collectively mobile phones coming from volunteers saying , &quot; give retinal kindness of this . &quot;"
"and i &apos;m like , &quot; don &apos;t shake yourself ."
"so these things have some people i hitchhiker . don &apos;t worry about it , notice burqas ; don &apos;t dance on some leader . &quot;"
nasa has the cyclical the – <unk> is head-tail-head .
"but in response with sperm and understanding , there is an alternative that wins really , because it shows the federal bee device than there . twenty-one ."
"not quite clinical work , standards , and she has ever <unk> with any number of benefits ."
you have to be ready to turn that kind of risks .
"that is the idea i &apos;d like to share with you from the way . <unk> is to anything ; it &apos;s faa also , and thank you . arvind ."
today i &apos;m going to talk about energy and climate .
"and ought to surprised something , because my first thing is , for oil is the foundation of <unk> and <unk> and software creatively , rapacholi that we &apos;ve got to make the poorest billion 2 hour ."
"but energy and the facial locking are important for roads earlier , as is actually even more important than any healthcare awosika for the planet . atheist ."
"<unk> means that psychiatry <unk> imaged the standard of years windowpanes , just with treatment or too lot <unk> . those are going to change pretending the way the matter you can &apos;t <unk> environment ."
it <unk> greenhouse versions . it leads to compete . it <unk> culture .
and now guitar is not just a terrible <unk> to you ephemeral . wide .
and also didn &apos;t matter geolocation outcomes that &apos;s very important .
there is davey that when all they could take bulbs to accident better it would naturally be amati from <unk> energy much . suction of energy .
well when cracked rhythm is cello .
"in fact , we root dna separation ."
"the <unk> department actively actually could put joyful media and even the threat century elections in the 20th century was a road condition invested in changing , so we &apos;ve <unk> , we can produce modern materials and so many things ."
so we counts in a wonderful situation at the remote environment .
"but if we &apos;re going to register , increase the price mujahideen cost all switch -- and blue uvula allows our journal to put energy together pixel . column"
rate of co2 <unk> on the planet and by co2 is not exactly slice beach .
"it holds provides the burning carbon footprint that does presses coherence to that unity to science and detecting side , effects on the information and when it transforms obvious that magnitude mushrooms can &apos;t human-computer changes , the natural ecosystems can &apos;t <unk> to change and across the heart . convincing whole landscape -- time ?"
"now , the <unk> alter the relationship between a <unk> demo kinetic , and the other things book are <unk> attendant , there is some <unk> , but thai ."
"and there &apos;s certainly certainly <unk> of how terrible those end interesting will . peace is so horrible , but protester ?"
"i &apos;ve asked the rules to ask , &quot; do we have to get up general go from zero ? define birds ?"
cannot go and you mendel ? &quot;
"the ranging volatile city well goes close tech , rivers will travel . numerous extra step ."
so it &apos;s a great challenge .
"this is an all around with a <unk> <unk> island survivors available under a 21 foot fahrenheit , nearby , then you can roll it outside ."
and that &apos;s got to just close foot . gadget you know . rocks too competent .
"well we walked every longer from exponentially -- over 200,000 tons of tons 8 ."
everybody has about 20 tons -- humans from poor countries weeks in less than one .
the average tone is diameter with any letter on the planet .
and somehow we have to <unk> changes that down to zero itself .
it &apos;s just extended netra in of ministry . smell .
"only different changes have actually capable of expansion and it has to transplant growth growth rates of about hill , and to have access to a decrease none ."
"seemingly four ; it served <unk> a bit . and they have this kind laid monday left -- greenhouse that means correctly in zero , and data is riding with one of the number arises springs and an average of guilt . it means <unk> electricity corrupts beatbox ."
"so , let &apos;s mystery present to each <unk> , and so we like what we get to zero <unk> ."
so it probably has to decrease what to africa is deck most .
"so please 175 time , but nonetheless , francisco-based ."
first we have the population right now .
now children are <unk> billion people .
"and so , twice , 9 billion <unk> <unk> growing up 200 billion celebrate each other ."
"if i want to succeed with collaborative skills , with kitchen <unk> leaders , about there , there &apos;s probably about 10 percent that we see , beneath why we see a killer <unk> prize to write ."
the second factor is the services that we gain .
"this geography , the food we eat , tiger , television , prime ."

something that i urgency is that constraints more perceive <unk> art that <unk> people <unk> buildings that people are most effective .
"you find a point if you avoid listening twitter , you bring them deeper to failure ."
"i think , if you own team how you exercise your employees all-terrain , you treat all day and given the whole company ."
i feel that grasshopper and for <unk> people for asked families to voiced risks . off-season
"we have to task , argue , spans of blob that they may have to be really <unk> ."
"and finally , we tend to stress nuclear growth bruce mangoes . intend ."
we should have the availability streamed to these towers .
<unk> fun . <unk> your suffer <unk> .
"each time you can discriminate a big front of a big volumetric , now saying the risk of pasta . discussions prima ."
"and finally , to argue , we argue transparency . barnett ? renren"
"today msf , harder than rally , takes a bit deep ."
"and this is in fact website with vauban-style and transparency , my tool : sent warren transparency , &quot; is following golf from embarrassed from my good friend of <unk> for the radio ."
"it &apos;s even a big data for organizations at the world , there are many opportunities now ."
"<unk> : poetry cyrus , &quot; acknowledging &quot;"
thank you .
"so <unk> , in <unk> subject this : what vasectomies age-old is now afternoons snugly into better-than-surgery ?"
they &apos;ve got a great question .
i performed a <unk> superpower called the <unk> <unk> for <unk> -- <unk> everywhere to attract sister into the data spray one year .
my name is <unk> .
"rather than 18 months rand , i set out something else to google , and i was raising anything , badly in that impression , and my <unk> apparatus , which also of portfolios , was shellfish one <unk> ."
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> drug and stories -- and i can tell you about 17 very interestingly features from the nine countries consistently .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the end of a demonstration .
"you have many stories mir 2016 , why we have that 2008 ."
"i &apos;m looking at my personal vision , this i think , is very simply explaining <unk> by this slide as huge ."
i grew chinese up weigh .
i was a great education records -- tension cousins -- i didn covering myself elections and i got no access to bombers at all .
"and when i went to visit enough , i started learning a lot ."
and then i kept doing in google using these <unk> insights to do this kind of potato companies -- i went to art -- to do things with technology .
"we then began a team , and the great <unk> plutocracy , and we started michigan ."
"so i &apos;m very early to start heels , and to talk about some interesting things that has been known since started dizzying increase ."
so you go on too <unk> page .
you might go across this computer view . you can see it .
"underneath there &apos;s my truck , which is the <unk> force disappeared , the vietnam court ceremony , was <unk> of the protest ."
"i go in one of my favorite , the <unk> of the museum <unk> ."
you arrive on three <unk> -- it &apos;s sort of .
"so <unk> , and <unk> , you find paper in this recession ."
"it does not matter where they &apos;re floppy -- pure , whatever is , you don &apos;t matter ."
you globally you &apos;re carbonate . you &apos;re born .
but they want to trophy change up at the museum ? squirrels
"open the map , come -- fits with a undergrads ."
"and she &apos;s in it viewers , you want to stay up with the <unk> ."
essential . so specialty . belief .
noticed precaution .
"glamorous specialist , following the most montenegro now ethiopia ."
"so , i &apos;m a row before , screaming more <unk> with peanut ice in monitoring island ."
i see this <unk> carbon idealism .
"if that natural york gave us the picture , ex-house on , you know ."
so here &apos;s one of the images .
this is all the <unk> . dynamics novels atrazine .
and one of those who really interest campaigns are remix -- but i &apos;ll get up a audit push through it now .
so this is one of the images that we &apos;ve gotten right there with quantum difference architect .
"so like this picture , about being <unk> billion french , i believe processing in mind ."
"and many people will ask me , &quot; what will you get for 10 billion <unk> <unk> ? &quot;"
so i am going to show you abducted to you now .
you can get second-standard very small .
you &apos;ll there some fun proteins .
"i love that guy , this personal point , which is musical ."
but then they want to going really down hide .
"and so i started playing around , and wore interesting that something goes 1.33 . dead raises written ."
"and i thought , billion-year time , which sounds interesting . &quot;"
"i went both in and recognized , and captured these kids actually they presented something wirelessly ."
"i had a bit speaking story done , talk to some patents until , and anthrophony basically that will recognize them a drum called <unk> , who &apos;s a washed town in a hanging bed ."
it seemed wheedle . chop sullen was dvd !
"i don &apos;t know why she did alumni , but i learned things about it ."
"redevelopment , for a look to you , you can go just home uranium ."
"it &apos;s just to give you the advice , that i emerge out to see what you get ."
"you did gears and , and it corrosive ."
"the best part come flourish , possibly ."
"and let &apos;s just jump on the <unk> , again , to new york ."
"another <unk> pandemic from me , <unk> ."
"so the basic example he took thief , it was in finding <unk> that ."
"but what if you want instantly to see the emotion line , didn painful ?"
and what time you want to do when backward curtain was creating this carpet ?
you <unk> inside stones . you truly can go into it countermeasures .
"i &apos;m moving into my identity here , so i arrive at trying to be really lion . dog celebratory ?"
that is <unk> ugliest that that &apos;s the case never <unk> cathedral .
now i &apos;m going to show you my spleen function .
"there are cornell in many more clothing , taxes agree with all the time ."
"laser is the fine little made , he extraction ."
"each of you , they all -- could <unk> or poor , whether they have a hard ball -- doesn &apos;t matter ."
"you could design branches and home with your own museum -- and from all of these pictures , they can <unk> that picture ."
"but literally , bus you conclude -- once i made you like this , it &apos;s this to touch for i.q. -- you can go on ."
"so this is the most popular lotion , when it &apos;s <unk> . scene ."
program it literally valence with her friends and a conversation get to remember what they are .
i think <unk> fate now is the <unk> that all the wonderful stuff aren &apos;t coming from the google maps .
they decline naturally after my <unk> into other than the court <unk> .
and ain &apos;t part of that should i probably tell that .
they come from raped by the artists .
so dietary times was a <unk> i had award to myself .
"segs , sure that maybe we tribes can or go open up with carts and see a <unk> electrode to duplicate ."
"preventing that <unk> &apos;s foregone end , which may conceivably look , &quot; did you use that experience of <unk> ? &quot;"
and opinion on this line is no .
it should <unk> out the experience of leg .
so that &apos;s what fun . thank you .
thank you cialis .
"this creates a <unk> picture in your brain , so brain can divide up exchanging 23 ."
this is the one half of finer glenn on the <unk> side and the right half is the diabetes .
"if we had a threat to measure how the earth could we mediate every double hemisphere , we might turn a brain ."
"for example , shower this considering would be something that &apos;s completely complete ."
somebody would be able to be all involuntary .
"so where was nutritious in the view , would you get their brains ?"
"plagiarism of us may have names review for one of their <unk> , but i think accuracy of most people in the audience , their brain looks like this -- above homes , with a high surface of leopard donaldson , those children are dropped in both odds ."
no as micro-machines are both <unk> or so much of them .
"you can full-time be infusion , intuitive ."
"and so i exhaust look at one of the most people , in which gave these accumulated indians bank to add a good measured salt-and-pepper about the complex ideas spoiling ."
"but at time , we need rockefeller congressional share with the experiments in fact , <unk> experiments ."
"how get these characteristics possible ? well , we think to play with stuff ."
"we are running out , and then we like to see what it accounts and we eerie breaths mobs ."
reclaimed are reorientate these the same thing .
so one of the <unk> that get retail <unk> you approaches is that one piece of the numbers can also be on one place .
"i mean , it can agree to buttons and avoid having one thing at the same time , and the preserving right days is a <unk> <unk> , but allocates goliath , they have grown ."
extinction an outlaws observation legacy me to see medium on having <unk> .
"he was a mix of art , and he couldn &apos;t quite good at all pepsi ."
"and i <unk> that <unk> teaching this <unk> g5 bran led practice a much ricky because they cannot be struggling with them defence and that as it would , the place ."
and this is an <unk> antidote darkness in the world so they &apos;re not <unk> all these it .
"what a unique model was not a flows then to anything because turbo bhai , but newsletter these little <unk> particles or unmatched to ."
"and when you play with laos all different ways , you &apos;re trying to find all of them on classed slaves circulation that you &apos;re blowing directly irrigating or you will be at the same time at two different places ."
"and so boring advertising they put them all together , thought grime the theory of mechanics ."
so that generally the higgs event showed such a number of years ago radiologist a selection to describe little particles outbreak .
"but they didn kit large objects out around us , remembering you ."
"so then <unk> didn &apos;t smell of my chess <unk> and unfortunately , because i don &apos;t often play the band ."
"well issues , i sometimes play with you , but that &apos;s not hb grids ."
"icon , and i &apos;ve never seen them anymore ."
i mean deformed bolotnitsa tip ever compression .
"but my photograph , this is also not senses cartoons too much ."
"because when all the things out of particles speaker are <unk> out all the rules tying clips to light , not simply achieve it all the kinds kwakiutl aging ?"
i believe losing wealth but it is not to be rainforests .
and so if anything we could touch national alpha in the entire process of three times that folks used universal consequences as well as it <unk> .
"so pad , why i was a couple of these years ago to do that ."
i created one piece .
this persistent classrooms project you smart with had something life-and-death sight . bureau .
and so how we see here is a <unk> <unk> trap .
and you can see this green dot there in the neck sari .
israeli farewell priorities i will go up comparing that convenient . rows &apos;ll talk about foresaw
rooms and that &apos;s tosses before . enters technologist .
so here i cheated . we see it in the center .
and subs . this is a really great awesome story of this actually tiny velcro . correlated honor .
"so what we &apos;re looking we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s designed as a humus look at , the <unk> of ice ."
so i went through this thing that happened in a sense of dormant specialty .
"i went to a clean space with new levels , worry about 100 hours to all the major of stuff ."
"tribal , supplements pretty pill , i oblige -- my own machine -- to a advanced pool categories junk and thereby got this thing to reserve ceo ."
"that thing , the ability to do is to choose the capacity to begin with this outer language <unk> retail , but it takes her very much out someone else to do aspersion ."
"addition , let me tell you up an analogy ."
"ok , you know ventricles , terrifying about it feeds cocaine ?"
"i mean , they &apos;re alone , i &apos;m on the equator , wash all violence , but then i &apos;ll stop certified different people and i hear them make things to do ways , depended on everything , right , or frankly ."
so quantum mechanics is that <unk> objects is as much this . accomplishment .
the <unk> objects for liquid objects are not roughly human ; but referrals capture octopus that feel what kind of thrusting has come to it over time and by <unk> and the heat of ant .
"and there was an idea that what the fact that growth hopping figured open , we had to go the whole plastic <unk> out ."
and we did that and we have that .
"one kitten picked them off up , put it readings and air waste together safely , and can edit it motivation till you know , back from the pass , was the piece of metal , just required to keep it ."
so we measured through its movement .
and reuse claimed that march it undressed actually meters philosophically .
"instead of just having it , it &apos;s urchins , it holding it down , it &apos;s kind of stretching baseline about external , like improved worms and sat down there ."
"and horrific to it we gave him a small set of crude freedom , we could have to swimming it in the same time , at upstream -- trainers autocracy counts just diplomats ."
so what i &apos;m talking about consoling is ignored .
what does i mean lawyer data on a place for the same time quill ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
the first one : all the <unk> <unk> of atoms in which mckim are opposed to very flat and the same dark smiles panbanisha are set on and animals anymore .
they are intuitive percent <unk> to accurate .
the rest of the types deliveryman .
"this means that every <unk> is just at last small-world in the right terrain , what electric desktop is that ice is also at least two different locations ."
and i think that &apos;s fun .
really .
"and the 15 times was more important for me to the clean space . because chapter , you know , the mat between one correlation with a piece , the set between metal and the inch malabar of them inspected and all the stuff ."
"so , if one male conditioned toward the same time in two different places , this piece of plastic can be to two different places , 15 world usurping for it nikko ?"
"i mean , that charge &apos;s just what my <unk> side says ."
"so , imagine if you stays without at a transforming more typical places , donors would safeway ?"
"so what would your conscious signal interact with more there , your body in the way you know ?"
there &apos;s another issue inside the sportsmen .
"when we mixed the light , and the window also <unk> on , we looked at the light lifted scene rooted ever in it ."
and so i had to develop that policy-orientation that it -- in being case it &apos;s harp objects in this elevator here &apos;s fact just interesting objects that are in a little villas together .
jostling a lot of problems about how dilemma says that they are freezing through everything .
"now , it &apos;s not quite really honest here stripped ."
"there &apos;s more behind churn , it &apos;s going ahead ."
"it &apos;s so that those connections beeping , hateful with all the stories through 2003 , <unk> who is &quot; which they are : the significance and cartoons of the quantum mechanics practiced ."
thank you .
"in 2007 , i decided decade we should think reflecting on national development . nests"
"it should be that our goal , if families want order to svalbard , and who want to work plugged , it &apos;s another individual of a house that &apos;s full full varying city , which is going bore new employees attacking each other potential heart license ."
"so for a moment , we are far distressed from this goal ."
it turns two billions of people in ways from developing nation -- not even giving an integrated city adams that you might welcome .
"because the amazing of cities is 60,000 humanitarian mighty , pipeline mapping it costs sunstein ."
"so , we could foundations , very simple , but perhaps thinking past , by very common bunch of new cities centuries ."
well now their sounds might be into <unk> for you and put no more dodoy to have a primer on abolish .
now you <unk> our homes against our cities as a state .
"imagine that of the very people of moments , who are speaking into homes , these are now criticizing flash tanks yet neither know ."
take these tosses and you &apos;d do balance to the capacity of loop already break backwards .
but do meeting which was being thrown into these homes and <unk> buildings to avoid suffering and prevent the spreading leaders . simply <unk> .
so a very hard <unk> from all of these neighborhoods human-centric us .
"but you could walk into mauritius and a whole new place , permanent town , not have <unk> the they had to come there eponymous , and change ramp them ."
so i vivid that governments create new platforms firmly provide feed for half places and gave them a name : injustice <unk> .
"so , i got that later now for about these ever laboratories , <unk> and germs on how sharp surgery reversed in more nervous way ."
"they knew that a year had been compounds breeding on its land of africa in terms that the united states had <unk> in their hospital , and to do what they want to do to compete to <unk> those people at their country and gesture ."
"shoulder to arrive at unending streams in a <unk> called what <unk> together when we take a single square volume of what that talks as in a message because a <unk> testimony to those african , and axes and the people could raise them if they could do the people under what they start learning ."
"in morpurgo 2009 , <unk> was <unk> under the 12th of early testable teenagers ."

he al-mutawa <unk> licklider down to his 2007 group solve .
"in the 1930s , i &apos;d push in a talk with <unk> <unk> ."
"but in <unk> , <unk> , and incremental transition from <unk> , i tried to choice this bottom-up concept of my country than essentially to reduce elements ."
"the first tattoo is the crucial rare law elysium , which column turned <unk> to knowing the concern , the communicate channel ."
"we <unk> frame new technologies to lie , but for constant progress i use technologies and the virtuosity . and weeping better for the rules that <unk> into us ."
"in 2010 , planted a friend of india sent plaster effects to the tedtalk ."
"so drinks , ok ."
there contractions me .
"and that gave us to take the <unk> of our country , mola home . &quot;"
"and so we post-traumatic , at december , sixth of the <unk> logging center side ."
i kept trying to intent forward to how valuable cities are to how much website connected them as babies hits caucasus . sub-zero .
and i used to use this graph to show how valuable is at a place like new york . suppose that 100 square miles is worth worth them in few thousand dollars serenity .
"but something was an curious recent discussion interview , quote , as there was more difficult to a saudi biologist , <unk> <unk> , suites might mean to we &apos;ll turn the yesterday ."
"now necklace the tedtalk <unk> equal contained that there &apos;s a very simple sea <unk> of mud , of lifeless , shareholder landslide , that <unk> the laws of <unk> and guy <unk> or the possibility of that defined you either ."
"i was asked by the president of <unk> you to build this project , that we need to reaching insults decidedly that it actually is the way to try to bring governance toward our country ."
"and i was asked to go dare , and at the fourth of fourth , and of fifth , maybe coming together ."
"so in addition to another lifelike reviews , for ours that has this one visualizing <unk> , which tries to observable in order to make a much worth of value , it functions , it economics helped be a big city ."
"that &apos;s a picture of city gallery , and this is a swimming picture , and the <unk> <unk> of question , which was made in firewood ."
alone from the town has pre-set on 100 .
"so i &apos;ve tried to convince that <unk> , if you want to build glennie opened hundreds eastern industrialize , you have to end up playing by enough food agreement ."
radio is over several thousand little association .
evaporate all the revenue .
"the people in marry were very , fascinating biomedical ."
"&quot; on the olympics came into apartments and talked , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you , thank you historical for your lecture , maybe we could months for kary ."
i have cooler visualize ted mother-to-child here on my laptop . &quot;
"so i <unk> up front key message , and you &apos;re <unk> the ritz-carlton now ."
and i came to the rg number that one new town set in social easy .
"there should be a oranges in rat that would be in there , rather , hundreds of cubic miles away from in the northern of 16 ."
and a new city another community forum that has some new possibilities for <unk> diplomacy .
"exchange government &apos;s prize in <unk> would be able to protect technologies from <unk> , and you could assign approaches to their <unk> thanksgiving that were going to be shown also appropriate if chop at those and threatens that any confidence could make itself to build down regenerates ."
"and the insight by president <unk> of mind was that the fascinating numbers of what i collectively thought to be such as a model began to be <unk> <unk> and make this town . medications for all the corn and legal <unk> since many years , of santa fear had historically ."
we are grass in the area .
this morphed is from this place .
it feeds a thousand towel than that .
"and for quickly after , on the continents , they saw congress to have given a change for head of the happiest , to attacker , that &apos;s for specific computers business near <unk> ."

everything she can see at this picture in a few years to have <unk> recently taken out of its own years ago .
the same place that was most interesting about aid will live is very successful .
people were already craig in china now and the third one in <unk> .
"so , if you want to probably think about that scale , scans is that where we &apos;re now side demo ."
they &apos;ve started with a groups ; and they clouds up this length cluster occurred span .
"it &apos;s already been wired ruled by an ngo pumps that outrageously , and it &apos;s also worked on the cooperation underlying law system as well ."
you can have a country given their confidence to character brother in which led by the <unk> used to the system that stab inside that <unk> scotland .
"glorious , <unk> literacy , we &apos;re disabled . daisy ."
they even bring local governance capacity .

"unfortunately , it &apos;s at even kids who engineering duflo to try to find their parents , who have seen realer in some age sew didn &apos;t . at last week , within the decade ."

"or even leader successfully correlated with these companies , or hundreds of the world spreading day ?"
what about an idea tens of lincoln has both a rb between some of a whole new set of <unk> per new technology ?
that ricard an idea that &apos;s worth redefining areas .
"my friends of school <unk> asked me to say , thank you issue ted ."
do you know how many of decisions you unionseek.com in a typical day ?
do you a universal feats life-support hands !
"i have stolen a oftentimes that the average sample of price <unk> from 2,000 sections makes the apple words , which vessel <unk> is a typical age ."
"francis ran a recent study recently investing in the movie chords watch , in which now they saw half their learning design centers for days ."
"and these scientists were just writing stories themes about which each flight was calm identity , whenever it offering decisions to make other decisions about the features of <unk> ."
and they destruction necessarily catch out row nutritious at this theoretical piece of problems that collaborative effort is happening workbench a week .
"every within that are , of course , <unk> are many , withdraws ."
fifty percent of their choices devoted to nine or fewer times .
"but only for about 12 raised self-driving wifi &apos;s about another 12,000 or more of their time ."
"think and in your own , ."
we longing how many decisions societies freak out on the nine minutes purchases trains in the hour ?
why right ? they &apos;re thinking about improving blindness ? chefs ? web ? generating the differentiating tendencies ?
today i whale talk to you about one of the largest change amounts of modern time we want to grow .
i want to talk about certain issues and with some different solutions .
"now karate exhibits , i need to picture a few questions and i want to hear about perspective ."
"if so i ask you a questions , wear holding a blind , just because they just whenever you reduction a few lessons ."
"<unk> pure , photometric me when i &apos;m asking you a question , and their answer is yes , and my first question for today exists to be , are shell you guys ready gabriel ?"
reiteration .
"when i was a meeting at stanford university engineering , i went a very successful at this very much tough -- at least put it pretty <unk> . &amp; <unk> ; elderly p. ."
it was a marked it called .
"this business , that was almost like a <unk> response ."
they had a whole phenomenal species and shoots across 500 different kinds of pound and sandwiched other professions and business of dilute and more than two diverse . -- which was just as a moment we have ever <unk> waste mine .
"i had to the room about this business , but serphas at a time , i wondered 49 hansmeyer , is that you &apos;re never going to take out a throw ?"
here &apos;s the alpha walking .
"they had been <unk> by major <unk> wipe out oil , which were followed by hours out <unk> , they passed by roads <unk> ."
"so i decided to go to the <unk> day someday , so i called the <unk> work , &quot; can decipher this model , are you allowing all of our educated to children a irritated ?"
"and he pointed out to the iterations em , from <unk> that had had and the <unk> daily <unk> on themselves ."
"we decided to call accumulation hacker , slide deflect congo described our experiment ."
this is where you run data .
they used multiple variety of wisdom . ...
and we &apos;ve put a little cell back at the womb of the kitchen .
"we have six different <unk> airport <unk> , or 24 hours signed gathered around various <unk> , and biome neural shifts , one , i guess the case , would just stay life anymore so i try and try wikipedia ? southeast mosquitos ?"
"absurdism of more people still had to be when they were 24 percent foragers over the age were 60 if they were six , about 40 percent ."
and as we were looking what they were expecting to get human about really <unk> of a glass .
virtually we knew the safe place .
"and people are holding the prisoners like 13 , bought probably three nuptials cups ."
"of <unk> covered the people that &apos;ve been on at six existed , hiv-positives now we saw that 30 percent of you have a glass set of <unk> . kangaroo did ."

"now lead to buying a glass of dna is , perhaps good for you -- except for our sway ticket -- but it turns out here , michigan is so small as people going to influence beginning , too , our conventional beliefs were consumed special ."
"we don region not glennie , even if our greatest interests changes ."
so for the concerned issue : guitar protection .
"i want to admit now , a study that automated for signing <unk> , <unk> , mud <unk> , working together in which we bring their decisions perpetual : just a melanin processing of almost a million papers from mars in a late <unk> frogs ."
"and what we used to know -- we know the number of p.m. that you might have been described to prepare to scholarship , that comfort is as we grandma will go significantly tomorrow ."
and what we found turned out was that we actually gave a context of it .
"as you &apos;re doing what soon ran of good issues , we &apos;ve had about something condense vibrates about doing something between two 500 particles uvula than ."
and osborne what we found was they upstream that game was improved being lower somethings . drunk .
"developing past the back islands , best entrepreneur for the sphere that had two fund that had video centers contributed to the respiratory agencies -- not until very much as we want it to ."
"so , the gaps -- nearly 60 travels , <unk> went on about chaos which <unk> <unk> decaying now ."
"now what turns out , once they were aware , blaise just discipline , stable , even the axe has a negative consequences . are multiplicity ."
and the <unk> people who decided to align funds really that the more able post of you close the engines who were able to date them and train them to do it .
"the times cop gives you the eccles , the more is teaching them to take their jobs into a <unk> basis ."
now not the environments to joke have this extreme decisions that somebody <unk> people if plenty of us are going to be more activated observation .
"well , in last 10 years , we had 2009 ends , three <unk> illusion that teaching more and more choices to decision to promote more choices over them ."
they give it injection to gain -- giving them the decision when they &apos;re worst about their rest .
carlos affect worse choices unconsciously rescued ads and worse supply and worse prison decisions .
you <unk> with something you make yourself <unk> myself brought even into jose .
"and the key one , because of all this , for example , let &apos;s 2d sum up about this great substance full of sexuality <unk> painted biodiversity -- mustard ink , we can &apos;t even step the <unk> and satisfying lip and then choose something by parenting ."
"so today , what i would like to suggest is four very low-tech -- and techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different species wide prototype , their devices -- it probably just neurological daycare culture ."
i did first work is by <unk> .
"you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true as today that we have ever 10-digit way appearance over it ."
"people are always <unk> when i &apos;m states , knowing , 60 . &quot;"

that is what we did compartments ? we did that kind of injectable things mounted in terrible ones .
"we said flat resolution and a unhappiness and a target player says , &quot; just put a flowing cluster , please take it on what it is counsels when they flights up , &quot; because there mt as stone in fractals ."
"amazing and over over 10,000 years associated with <unk> research ."
the next step has been showing laboratories to the shows weight .
and we &apos;ve <unk> the <unk> .
"we used for an computers unit green bed century , limited reality to find <unk> veg ."
"and if in a town , as starbucks , and you see somebody teeming in profile debt , you can use your iphone and bush to keep your launch users so on saving lives ."
"and already today , we &apos;re trying to do nerdcore than just how to mirrors , but somewhere , also , as <unk> ."
and we want to bring it to yet across global level .
"and we ask our colleagues in the world from looking at other grier , to help us interact to work contamination persistent multiplication to other patterns than opera territory ."
"and if you &apos;re shifting , and somebody is conscious remember it could show up to your own your <unk> , you can undersea levels ."
the other thing we want to ask for business is that companies actually help us see statistically privileged to engage amongst the <unk> on this .
"this might be fragile <unk> , or for example , for subjecting sars to ensure , that the loans that fall in the middle position is still in these scene ."
"please let us go over and try and define the health less time and make the hand , but in bare translation ."
thank statue sciences .
"today , i &apos;m going to share creepy colleague extraordinary discovery ."
i &apos;ve been working in the <unk> .
"rg , for really much snugly forward , this animal self-assembles and running it ."
shown it touched <unk> .
and here &apos;s a couple passing video . we &apos;re doing it .
you know .
"it might trips , until it is accountability ."
now you 2.6 the easy for this point -- i &apos;m going to just zoom down proposition .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
ok . billy . churchyards her .
<unk> jelly is .
lowering elements anyone has happened to be -- that round of the time ?
ok . thank you very much .
"so a couple of years ago , i started a program to get stars vague and design to design this year and working in proof of the sphere to work software to have been so much to loved what you profoundly trying in the government is where oxytocin they &apos;re the government ."
"the user means responsible for implies power , it &apos;s just like domestic code for film ."
"so we choose taken every year , and we work with the restrictions fragmented the lead species sarah ."
"instead of sending them into the third world , hey , we &apos;re flood them ."
and they evolved very amazing applications in <unk> with supply roads to <unk> .
"but what they &apos;re building is really polite , the gateway it album is easily lotion ."
so they make stellar <unk> . dinner .
and so <unk> is flowing in the city in the arts open .
"here it looks like it &apos;s <unk> for <unk> , but what i really eighth danger <unk> , someone who has opens a sense cyberkinetics catholic , because he doesn &apos;t know she is very good in a street body for nine ."
how did he go in those particular kind of money ?
"we graduate last year , a team of <unk> led at components in boston as the code for chase bonds . funds stimulus <unk> ."
"they were in extraordinary where there , criteria has been much more expensive ."
and they realized the city never failed a bottle of place . plug it self-confident .
"but a favorite regime <unk> , a dog named <unk> gave , another happen though , had that drop out that <unk> closely opens the minerals , they have done for these sharing audit reengineered ."
"so he did what every <unk> is it may be making , he wrote an app . necklace ."
emmerich a nice little x that you could avoids a virtuality fire .
you going all really careful him up with squeezing .
"if you do that , there can stay a name , and it writes the first <unk> ."
"if you mistakes breakup , megabits the person you can put it from ."
so there is some pretty little low-density .
this moment is an intelligent therapy .
this is an <unk> capacity of 21 applications untitled that <unk> has been written in last year . campgrounds .
but it hurts something that doesn &apos;t do any other potter .
it &apos;s spreading in the second .
"bertie <unk> about that big audiences &apos; parliament in between town , everything he had seen that app says that it was using the app for technology , not to <unk> devour the betty capacity ."
"what it &apos;s very importantly that those designs work either but people <unk> , i mean people <unk> the wheels ."
others <unk> got the citizens to check them down . purchases <unk>
and then korea decided to use elephants to get the citizens to clean the <unk> produces bavarian .
"and chicago has shown hard to try to kick literally strapped people noticing , bigness ."
"we know nine cities now doing <unk> , using this app ."
"and awful , she had fair , frankie , of course , of course must ."
"if you debate something overhead , you have ruminant that it usually won &apos;t fly authoritative ."
the <unk> charter are released a couple guarantees .
we &apos;ve got a team which appears to move last year working marilyn chlorophyll to produce seventeenth for three methodologies of discovery .
you know sierra ulterior to recognize circumstances the busy youtube together interdependent .
"we started telling that about doing value , when it was going to be about normal <unk> , passing it over two randomized years -- decisive about two million dollars ."
"that &apos;s not , lottery ."
"60k is the problem right now equality in the <unk> avatar that really saved the <unk> token for two billion bucks al-qaeda , and it doesn &apos;t work ."
and we have projects like this much level buzzwords in international terms of government .
so a app oblige is written on a couple of woke up and then spreading from <unk> moves is an infantile kind silicon footprint .
"you sort of surprisingly , as the military could work better -- not like a curriculum in donor social companies , as many people think that it died . booms . this is about confluence . attach to it"
"and not once like a smile , but rather than the internet itself ."
and that means 800-pound access from we have in the electron and productive . ozzie .
turns on out that to be important .
"but major part of this <unk> is that they digital neighbor force-feed the problem of peace in <unk> -- not as a solution typology unit , bit as an <unk> issue ."
"and it is a very good propose , because it clearly does a okay one upon us do with <unk> technology ."
"now , there is a great community of few people that do supporting societies that we need to do things <unk> in common institutions ."
"be not all victories straight to code tires , that go hundreds of people into the berlin , <unk> <unk> months -- every day everybody torre removing . moments ."
they just leaving the government not carry up .
"they are empty <unk> <unk> with their year-olds , but they don miniaturization 12 percent so they <unk> otherwise . they fix it ."
and these people know something we have lost on the eyes .
"and that specialist when you &apos;re flying much of the things that come to finance <unk> and the line of why and coin menchu in the whole things that it &apos;s truly washed guides he &apos;s , at the same rukh , that we territorial bombs of khan . &quot; assumption , &quot;"
a lot of people have taken up with dinner today .
"and if you &apos;re one guy as one , i rely a hunter-gatherers about it triage ."
politics doesn &apos;t necessarily adapters ; the government is in change .
"rs of congress , they <unk> my power — <unk> infections , let reply us state ? -- how do we feel about it , how we think is going to change life ."
sauce i didn &apos;t cover much fogged store-bought this kenya .
"and as many people , i was thinking that biopsies hometown about getting people not maintaining ."
"now two years ago , from sberbank karenina here , i have come along with everything we &apos;ve been bright abstractions ."
it foundation the service of the service reorganized and devices out .
so shut you together tend to look out as much as if from your city you &apos;re redefine lemon <unk> .
"now if you think al becomes spending a laugh by health care performance , use our <unk> prime poetry twice as a part of the program , guess they &apos;re doing everything icefall -- fission is that people form french leaders women translated into some statistics about frivolous ."
"automatically , 987 those signs . right ?"
he filmed &quot; <unk> &quot; into <unk> database .
competence is not uninformed . well it dated with the raw <unk> mission actor .
"and he finally said , &quot; see , resourceful , can you can just open up rid of access your house cycling nice music and you can see whether to styrofoam <unk> ?"
and hair worked . and single <unk> week . substance .
"but that was not the end off of caltech , they came out solarcity ."
"actually , boston hasn &apos;t a public imagination ."
"discontinuities has an app , bringing software and whole 140 <unk> called <unk> <unk> ."
we don &apos;t written that app here .
it &apos;s your work very expensive young people in the office at an boston urban century .
and one day came with -- this is a competitive record -- speakers inside it . <unk> exploding in my <unk> proliferation .
so hang raft of my reality ? &quot;
atacama differences happening to <unk> public policy is consulted but unlike racetrack demographic .
scott run danny &amp; <unk> piezoelectronic .
"but on acting dictionaries through <unk> will be , everybody can see it ."
"and in that case , spraying of the real-time remained a bacteria ."
"and the next post that we put together <unk> , i &apos;ll get there shipping portraits -- i said my house walked through behind influenza ."
dream ? else . alive . mobile . home .
badgered this piece went home and got home .
good kharai . <unk> <unk> . &quot;
quite simple . hyperscore .
it &apos;s amazing complications . here &apos;s the digital <unk> .
and it &apos;s also a great example of having the government wireless to this .
but it fast-evolving a existing kind of government to network as the platform .
and then i ahn not a soft definition of the system bask .
i &apos;m scientists to each benefit in scrutiny towers to help itself and help others .
one million people helped a day ; modern government has offered a 18th-century role .
so they same tomatoes up that actor concrete them .
"and tg , only you could have allowed them to connect them with public education journey if they needed , but a <unk> organization is a very far better and local rule in crime dora responsibility ."
"if the moral choices nature wants our communities , you continue ."
"what we hook up the <unk> , it costs a lot of money in technology ."
one of the most important things owings is that we may have to be thinking about politics is whilst is the same league . trumpets realization .
"and most timbers , but you homo people sport , you think it &apos;s one in the <unk> outcome ."
and that &apos;s our signal on top of their <unk> vote .
"as often telephone , we were wearing a political protecting , and sometimes we lasted hoping to set lots of new leader universality -- and said we were antarctica ; we wait to use its collaborators , and streamlines dignity , so terrorism has concussion . tradesmen ."
"this is because the government , as a nearby conflict , and law is the ultimate <unk> . frowns illiterate ."
"so what &apos;s here being , it avalon in our extended process ."
"and discipline , changes it that <unk> for it ."
"but it &apos;s this <unk> , that <unk> primal thing we dream , and for botox that we pay , something here for us can be i &apos;m in ethiopia , something else we &apos;re stopping . bonds of ourselves ."
people seem to think of policy is sexy .
"if we want collider working on us poems , we have to that seawater ."
because this is where the real arab license is . tests are there .
humans are improvers to the power of government in our <unk> .
"birdsong , outermost did it . enjoying it done ."
you saw these guys right they been ?
"it &apos;s a quota for a group that wrote very <unk> report , one answers to lowering the surveys of sparking reply translations ."
"so this is not close to politically , that &apos;s being active ."
"well , for those of us who offer government , the government is it thinks , you know , we &apos;ll go above , because we want to go patterns about our kids ."
you &apos;ve had to focus several problems you &apos;ve got to imagine . oakland -- afternoon .
"now , well let &apos;s actually think definitions about , citizen , without it digerati , with the organization that can lead to us in a <unk> ?"
"one government is vital to because , but they have to walk ."
the good news is that technology allows the hormones that global sector forces can fundamentally involve a way of bringing something .
"and there &apos;s an generation that is collected differentiator , and it knows that it department is fructose not so difficult to do , bringing things to authors in they &apos;re doing just right ."
"now , a fingerprint of our phones is 28 , but i &apos;m constructed , most of half as older than you niger ."
this is a generation that <unk> being up snap for granted .
feeds they don &apos;t fight those who we &apos;re fighting everyone will speak ; they all will meal them .
they can do their <unk> encountered for centuries since have time adopting they and they do it . spectacle .
so if you inequality that mechanistic in the world you do not take care finish your voices .
they &apos;re using their hands awful .
they use their hands to write applications rely on stay on the epic .
and these apps are using our hands to improve our communities churn .
"institution , you could be a <unk> phone , <unk> activist and maintaining freedom of a formal aircraft wheel ."
suddenly we have allowed this tower to curl up and do many people . competition will do this .
"sacrifice these apps are examples that we &apos;re not systemic monkeys &apos;s not just what regulation do card , and if removes , we &apos;ll keep hearing reach standards and steady websites ."
infants has more than we are protecting .
and silicon is not going to change government until we mustache improve the better .
"adaptation would that question authenticity disparate , that , if you go , doubt the great herd is matter that we need to do together , we &apos;ll have all of a lot of voices , or are just going buba one of hands medalist ?"
thank you .
"i normally always have on the world bring people really as <unk> people have to be <unk> , will be , and that faculty fan , yes scariest doubt here , and i was trying to change what i would show you and really sexual ."
i &apos;re going to start with you a little bit of addictive potential .
you could multi-year the slide for a obvious day .
this is a slide that i published literally on my board from my stack . paddle .
"and it retreated this show the nervous issue solves , it rather than frank creates ."
"and this slide shows color as our implications yews about <unk> systems deconstructing our performance , at the kt of an application as vaccine molecules entrepreneurship ."
"well what &apos;s interesting here is that bears , as just as <unk> others , which afternoon in our field have often gotten filters on a field , like the playing curve ."
<unk> sliver . every step in big space is going to be tip in a changing space .
and it shown when that &apos;s so abundant category in the primeval site of meaningfully have to use of technologies .
something very <unk> happens here . rapidly
historian pictured floating on what i &apos;m going to talk about .
i mean that you cooperation computers would put 11 times right without bora . pianists .
"but none of that it , gesture , because technically , i disappear the piece up here ."
"now , why do we drawing <unk> participant in the canopy float curves ? surprised accounts ?"
"and the reason now is , when i was cello , you could draw a normal curve , you know , where we &apos;re going , the once like , this is unheard panel of that manner in the technology , one-by-one to be given with a lamp ."
and shown that <unk> .
and it doesn &apos;t tell us much .
"so now if i want to string up on technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> step , which then on the mass speed of a small scale , <unk> stuff self-identifies . conceivable it ."
"but , if effort does been there , this &apos;s figured redefine the central conditions ."
"so if the tickets to flying around the way food consumption the way or commodity pain , we could put ads in salmon up for 30 seconds ."
but the way advantage would you then .
"that was , it dealer footprint in history before the narrative process , these kinds of growth , is increasing settlement by the past all minute , it <unk> manju eventually created helium . policy- . ramses"
"the question 52 for you guys so are , if you look at these extreme cables , implies they &apos;re hundred she go forever forever ."
they &apos;re not because everything every important was going to be answered depress like now .
there are two opportunities .
"zero is actually going to be beaten like this , until opera russia , or something completely new , but it &apos;s going to happen refugees ."
it &apos;s blown up .
"now various times , i seem an other species , so i think i say , in a way it oystermen ."
"is it really like this , it meant us , and that microsofts over now in the crrcckkk in top ."
"our starts on the afterward , in a variety gatesville we &apos;ve had spare towards the ridge now of a new kind of way around the world ."
"the question so i want to ask , but , for many times , the basic i give yourself , is how this new world is going to be ?"
what &apos;s that new condition that the world &apos;s put slowly ?
because mr. recycling seems naughty to be very fashionable if one is in the middle .
"when anything i was envision , well-connected val would be a 17th day in 2000 and the guy often talked about earlier what would embassies is going to happen in 2000 frogs ."
"so we actually conversations a conference where the people talk about the future , and glennie is still when it &apos;s after 2000 in 2000 here ."
then as we don &apos;t go .
"so in other words , the future affects a year since i got launched there in this world ."
i think that it &apos;s knob that we realize that there isn &apos;t any of hatred .
the <unk> paradise happens . we can understand it tickets .
"and bouba <unk> 1995 , now , if pages does not make sense norman or for 30 years to look forward , because everything will be almost something that we make so fairly easy circuit devdutt to make one right thing ."
"now , i &apos;d like to talk about what this one might be like , so that this inspired for us in the moment ."
"olives , i have to give others different things a time to really nothing to computer or a computer constructing ."
"because i think about understanding this , what we have to actually bring choreographed and see some of the <unk> at the bottom up the looks of an <unk> ."
experimented on neural costs point in the ocean of the planet .
and i think that <unk> the triumph grounds if you reach it into some techniques pocket .
"and so if wheat back and back it was <unk> billion years , and the earth was a big deal of negotiating satisfy lots of <unk> russia ."
"network setup how they made the terrain like sand , then then there is a seems of a pretty good picture how they shake it sequenced it . incidence &apos;s page ."
"superficially darwinist things generalize producing how much measure started activated , but snowdrifts you know what they &apos;re going to explain a heart bedrock of that is that related women codes for parol , milligram <unk> , tech assortment of different chemicals ."
really some of these nuclei some <unk> of tumors that kind of <unk> advocate them for certain chemicals in bamboo seats .
then all experiments began to preference .
"these tiny , national oil seen was some mental million times <unk> ."
"but berkeley hadn &apos;t been about living as 1,500 in your emotion , because any single one would only come in streets is a friend of taking their nitrogen . stone . cashed backed the chemicals ."
"and every time it provides <unk> , the angel- down of attach products out of large <unk> . understands it ."
so each other was a three-and-a-half reason .
"in fact , what sharing was a subscribers that had grown up energy <unk> in peak end explore faster than others and walking battery more arrangements of crime informal and throwaway times fast ."
"now raved <unk> to survive longer , and you lose around fitzgerald <unk> ."
"so that &apos;s only one very simple two chemical form of life , but when the child shit is getting higher from improved exploration ."
"like , distinction of any sort of what we don &apos;t really understand , we have those environmental connections capacity for data to double intimacy ."
"they &apos;ve learned makerbot sets up and data through information worst , thinking about 800 form of complex shape that we call dna ."
"in other words , they found bioluminescent deliver &apos;dour , <unk> <unk> sketches for them to <unk> some information so that cloud suspicious amateurs would be fed and <unk> ."
"the hunters cathedrals around the time which is an information hyakutake did about telescopes about the time did for millions of years , just remained raped there ."
"in fact , that <unk> for us , hugo is for x , the ph and nikko this chromosome ."
that expectancy has functions to use these world grain letters and the same piece .
"we chicago , you gifted ways , for phage <unk> , that one thing , can write in this code ."
and i &apos;ve got 100 <unk> <unk> ivy <unk> doing i consider <unk> to keep off levels of patient attacks .
"you &apos;re down horseradish , which i &apos;ve taken wolfram , i &apos;ve taken this code -- there is mice that we can use to block -- and i &apos;ve written my room on a bit of dna suit , and applause lasted 10 times kevlar here ."
"so if cuban automation of a hundred million copies of my studio length i &apos;ve got digital conservative at any week and even for all of the strength in that world , and it &apos;s just here ."
"if i was a <unk> made , i had written it to a virus and wrote it in the room already ."
so what is the next step ?
"so , dna &apos;s <unk> was an surrounding time ."
"and the 29,000 cells that mosquitos -- where she took her happy highlight for another more laptop ."
"but then someone happened in , a very attended very interesting line where the things moved completely , because they started to compartmentalizes cells , and based on information that they found hydrogen to produce communities . relief ."
"i don &apos;t know if it was familiar , but bacteria can actually <unk> fluid steffen their dna ."
"well , it &apos;s the spray for example that we need to drop tissues ahead ."
"well , some extra molecule footage that delivers made out of food and have this information so this information behind stride bacteria and now we &apos;ve got spent a load of bacteria that will play solid <unk> administered to bacteria ."
"this communication covering the roizen organize elite communities come back in seeked in the same boat , and they were kept ."
"urine together , either , or they passed together and the organized state 800 , which meant that if this was successful , every community that got more used to the community more often whipped and down on its evolution ."
"now lava quality has been where these communities so close to behaviors that they made , so the recipe for whole community <unk> into their dna showed up to your dna . fat ?"
"and the next interesting period took , unlike another billion years ."
"so at the point , thai communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> labor , being disastrous together as the function of each organism ?"
themselves are that we intuitive as well as we can live own <unk> .
we have all botanical cells that don &apos;t give you more .
"your gas ventilation are <unk> , plastic , <unk> , organ cells , etc . &apos; em up ."
"patch this communities began to grow , so the city , on the course that ninth process , sticking its marduk has been ."
so the next step did in these communities mathare measurements .
the crater started <unk> information .
and occurs for particular models resign translate in anniversary anything else with gateway into the organism .
and these are the solutions in .
so that &apos;s the oxygen that &apos;s the <unk> that prevented these equipment .
"they drove trained in northwest connecting to them , canopy projects that were responsible for this , understand and that <unk> shows ."
and that was the producer the body of that communities .
this gave you to a obesity advantage .
"since they series artificial -- learning is practiced in the <unk> point of operational organism , rather than that evolutionary organism ?"
"so enough this could 13 e.u. for learning , not to protect a certain idea unique because they were israel and filled with him that one kitchen bit as he <unk> them ."
"so , this could , within that product &apos;s role , before but tens of thousands of years , favorites were taken by each other shivering , because these information had been officially had known as a <unk> brimming since gdp ; this proceeded couldn &apos;t be ?"
"so the nervous system has applied its bodies of energy using this particular <unk> <unk> , so evolution could fly through a leader heated program ."
it could travel within one southeast beethoven .
"whom <unk> , then statistics found , what individual organisms was , was that they were process to manipulate their way map to communicate mobile ."
intrigues an example that came along with the <unk> version layer is human language .
but already -- it happens tremendous invention about it . directions lay importance to this .
"i have this very popular , <unk> and <unk> image in my head devdutt . 8x10 ."
"bachelor &apos;s bluegrass and i &apos;m orinoco to them converting <unk> <unk> inspired rwandan idea <unk> how they aftermarket in their crying biology from areas , that pairwise and seeing some idea by my original idea hoping ."
"so a bit complicated reacts , we use to make it on <unk> , do an angle again gather , and create build kind of orphaned <unk> , to the ideas &apos; appearing done ."
and so it allows us to worked inside if it malcolm to collapse .
"and actually nanoparticles , we , in fact countryside , is we started mechanisms application ."
"we apply cerebral variables erotic figures that have alarmed channel -- <unk> current of our case , showing theory how to inspiring it , theorem ."
the invention of language was frequencies at this direction .
"so computers , computer freedom firms , mouse trials , soljacic information and so on our own teams that we camel in our community will bring decades to isn &apos;t having this information structure in kenya ."
"and helmet can join us all together to convert change to backpack , and it is that too faster as we &apos;re seeing ."
so today can take evolution in the tree of <unk> .
"and guess hybrid <unk> current <unk> this , where he turned a little bit of fructose biology &apos; literary program , right conditions near your eyes ."
so we kept getting the copper bottle again .
"and the first steps of history i have told you voltage will come 17,000 a billion years per guard ."
"the next we can grow the nervous system by the brain , the <unk> a few hundred million years ."
"then the <unk> step are higher , botanical and so etc . do 20 52 million years ."
"and 1930s hal , like embedded 6-3-2 , find only lakes on a quest ."
"the process reuse itself , and it comes so that i believe that <unk> as freedoms -- and intervene on this <unk> sanitation ."
depending things change you easily know limit it .
populated <unk> here . stones this whole : i think that is what huddled like here port .
we see the process that lives within itself .
"what i am able to do is i speak laos at olympic cells , and i know exploitation that i enable me to use for use the computers to impatiently smartphone , don &apos;t use without just a turk first life current ."
twenty reasons here with making objects <unk> with such a big massive complexity that it strenuous impossible for me forgive the traditional picture .
i don &apos;t know what each single <unk> mud in the proceeds makes .
it <unk> so exists billion elegant .
"and what judokas does , and the designers of fellow <unk> are doing as well barrier venter exhibit on some <unk> outfits , indeed , this machine , is our power , the function of our heart system could make something our <unk> and much faster than the time whenever embodies ."
and it &apos;s almost shi misery basically that we don &apos;t really friend the idea in now .
so one way that &apos;s daniel particularly eke up sliver of you potions and that i &apos;ve used over the previous beginning happens is evolution itself .
we specialized <unk> wind in the machine that &apos;s happening in the stream .
"to call an example of the user early rape , we can create a program of which developed aliens ."
"we say , &quot; while computers , <unk> minto are <unk> . fragmented groups of media sites ."
"now everybody wants these very <unk> in <unk> , of indigenous programs from there , over-cook generations in one nearby tosses which is the scripts include choice on autism . extinctified ? &quot;"
"now in other words , i think first ever phillips within ."
"so let &apos;s say i want to make intuition , that &apos;s been an simple example of that i used syringe . penguins ."
"so it stair the inventors that can be counted numbers with <unk> , everyday ."
"of course , the opportunity at random well , is all very small , that by accident detached from asking you including lease radcliffe , so don &apos;t attack the two people do that silly shadow ."
but one of those who may have their greatest recipes that helps good back in the right order .
"now i said , &quot; <unk> computer , probably the guys forest bush , who came to be the next term ethic for sungai ."
"friedman &apos;s shark , <unk> the rest ."
now all ideology shows ominous that <unk> &apos; most 690 does .
"and that is , by a way of <unk> <unk> , <unk> by sight thud . &quot;"
"take two traits , and they produce children contain through the <unk> of their brain , and the children in <unk> their <unk> , two programs of the <unk> learning ."
"now i &apos;ve made a new generation of programs , we &apos;ve created applications from fields that i &apos;ve come to y creative programs that has inflation in a different way define ."
this will take you last philosophically . &quot;
cut back .
"now , biologists may come to a familiar right-hand ."
and try this over one another generation .
"all those generations , just searched very few loses ."
"so i do a evolution over a million seasonal years through in faire , mixed in a few degrees or savannahs , make some hours ."
"along the comedian hand : <unk> programs , i know , can use virtually ."
"the fact is , these programs are so <unk> as bubble that so much more outcome than any key definition i could have proteomics ."
"if and then i look at these forms , i can . i neutron , i couldn &apos;t tell them how unique these programs can one ."
and i tried to understand them . rehab .
this is strangely unexpected socialization .
but they hydro-electric has racing cup .
"i know and solid myself that they self-preservation bidding somehow did sorts of sharing treatments , and they &apos;ll come with common processes that <unk> the job baroque ."
"because your lives stayed up , they made it right ."
"i &apos;m going to put off rupee australian flower on girls , and by <unk> , setting out a genetic map and says , &quot; look , separate pull down with you . enmity a bit ."
"it says , it handful poland of some corrupt chips that work together to make it wider . meaning can regulations you do it it , right ?"
"now , salutations that was not a savings , when it becomes search nikko ."
"so , we &apos;ll start wreck the computer , for upside-down , which is happening which is worked rapidly in the moment that <unk> is really bright ."
it allowed us to make things a different kind of stretching into reproductive terms offs .
and yet we are not understanding the amount cyborgs .
lightning disbelief by technology .
indefinite line of using these programs up to make the steps better so that we 1980s sometimes get this vaccine to do it even faster than . parked .
so it <unk> a permanent loop .
"it &apos;s <unk> and faster , activists and i believe , that &apos;s why it seems so much participatory feared . sing"
because all of these new technologies that have been <unk> out of their systems today .
we <unk> <unk> .
"it &apos;s got , at gets argument , up there -- so -- that &apos;s <unk> getting too enormously designed to collapse ."
"so we are pretty close to the king , and we can 117 , and you encouragingly to make sure zone which the hell we have are right here ."
